00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Please help save Gon!

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.340
Use your heads!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.920
If you have an idea, take action!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.280
If there's something I can do, tell me.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.910
I'll do anything!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.990
Defeat x And x Reunion

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.000
The results of the eighth chairman election

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.270
were promptly counted by Beans.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.510
Now, please take a look at the result of
the eighth election for the 13th chairman!

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.890
Wow!

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.770
Eighth Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Leorio 282 (44.4%)
2) Pariston 250
3) Mizaistom 58
4) Cheadle 16
Turnout: 95.4%

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.380
This puts Leorio in first place!

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.670
For the first time, Pariston hasn't
finished in first place...

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.820
However, the first place vote-getter, Leorio,
received only 44.4% of the vote.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.240
That was below the 50% requirement,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.540
which means we'll finally have a run-off
between the top two vote-getters.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.290
Are they serious about this?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.410
Then I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.850
Oh, it's Brother.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.750
Morning.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.390
Did you sleep well?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.850
Uh-huh.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.810
Where are we?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.390
The hospital.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.680
My friend is here, sleeping. He's very sick.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.330
I want to help get him

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.930
on his feet again.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.250
You want Something to take over.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.980
Boo! Just when I was able to spend time with you!

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.110
Don't worry.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.890
Like I told you...

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.750
We'll be together from now on.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.340
And that's a promise.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.630
Please help me.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.460
I knew it.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.400
Killua is the one person who doesn't
have to follow the rules.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.200
Though I'll have to check

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.960
whether it's specific to Killua or something
that happens after a wish is used to heal.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.910
Okay, I'll do it.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.640
Either way, the power to destroy and fix

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.000
can become a powerful tool
if the user can be tamed.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.440
His utter lack of humanity and wicked ambition

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.560
deviate even from the path of an assassin.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.620
How tragic...

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.270
When he was being controlled, he suffered less.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.650
Alluka is only awake when Something is asleep.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.930
She spends less time as Alluka than one would think.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.980
The time after Something's requests
aren't met and people die,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.860
until Something makes the next level-1 request...

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.660
Or the time when request-making is paused
after someone leaves Something

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.830
before her three requests are complete...

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.860
Or the time after Something fixes and falls asleep,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.210
until someone else makes a wish
to Alluka and has it granted...

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.910
Making this the last wish and never
wishing to Something again

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.630
would be the best thing that could happen.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.280
Hand... Hand...

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.150
Please,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.820
Something...

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.200
Please heal Gon!

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.500
'Kay.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.590
Such incredible power...

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.050
What's happening inside?

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.000
Who's doing this?

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.830
What is this?

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.830
I've never felt anything like this before.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.310
Are you serious? Are you serious?

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.260
Then I'm going to do whatever I want.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.750
Magnificent.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.910
I want this.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.780
This...

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.020
belongs to me.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.890
Then let me ask the two remaining candidates

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.030
if they have anything they want to say.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.040
If not, we will proceed with the final vote.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.000
It's futile.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.800
It doesn't matter what you have to say.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.500
Well, I have a feeling that
this election is already over,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.050
but I would like to ask Leorio-san a question.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.310
Can you answer this question for me again?

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.680
What will you do if you become chairman?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.290
Leorio-san, can you please
give us your answer again?

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.000
What will you do if you become chairman?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.820
Save Gon!

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.570
And I'll make all of you help me!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.530
That's all.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.150
This would have been the perfect time,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.320
but I'm not God.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.780
In that case, do you have any
plans for shuffling personnel

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.000
or restructuring the organization?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.260
Of course not!

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.600
I don't even know why I'm
standing here right now!

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.320
Naturally...

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.350
Those are all the questions I have.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.610
It's futile, Pariston.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.860
Everyone was aware of those answers
when they voted for Leorio.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.930
His supporters applauded because they
have every intention of backing him!

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.300
Do you have any questions for me?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.440
No! Let's just get this over with!

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.630
I understand.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.630
Then I move for an emergency council.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.140
Huh?

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.720
Er, what are you saying?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.640
An emergency council.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.340
In accordance with the Eighth
and Ninth Hunter Commandments,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.400
I move for a vote of confidence.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.110
The topic will be a revision of the Hunter
Commandments and the Hunter Exam.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.160
First, I propose that we abolish the
current Hunter Exam system.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.860
If you agree, please vote "yea."

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.730
If you disagree, please vote "nay."

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.220
Hold it right there!

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.310
During the Zodiac council, we decided

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.510
the Ten Commandments weren't to be touched!

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.050
That isn't relevant right now!

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.300
No.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.050
You're wrong, stupid tiger!

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.930
You're absolutely right.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.280
The council reached an 11-1 majority decision.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.930
I was the only one in favor of
revising the Ten Commandments.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.580
If Cheadle-san or Mizaistom-san were
standing on the stage now,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.570
I would have deferred to the council and
kept my mouth shut until the election ended.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.520
But both of them are out of the running.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.080
And Leorio-san has stated that he
has no plan for the Association!

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.160
This is the only time

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.000
I can express my opinion as vice chairman,
and not as a member of the Zodiacs.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.960
Don't you understand, Kanzai-san?

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.970
This is the only chance I will ever get!

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.970
Of course, I could use the Eighth Commandment

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.570
to override the council's decision
and force the matter to a vote.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.930
But I wanted to avoid that.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.740
The Zodiacs are something precious
that the former chairman left us.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.630
Hey, if you say something stupid,
he'll pay you back ten times over.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:33.080
Honestly, part of me wishes to let this
matter die without making waves.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.660
However, the late Teradein-san and
Bushidora-san made an excellent point.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.280
The Third and Fourth Commandments

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.760
are suffering gravely as a result
of the current exam process!

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.990
He doesn't want to win.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.520
He doesn't want to lose, either.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.270
You're right...

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.900
He's a spiteful person!

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.440
He doesn't care about winning or losing,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.760
so with nothing to gain or lose, he can
always stay dispassionate and calm,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.390
while he manipulates others and plays the rules

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.900
against us in the worst way possible.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.920
May I say something?

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.330
Yes, what is it?

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.810
If Leorio wins, I volunteer to serve as an advisor.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.910
I promise to conduct a comprehensive review of

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.940
the Ten Commandments and
Hunter Exam at that point.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.190
I won't let you grab any of the Teradein votes!

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.070
I'll counter every point you've made!

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.220
To everyone who's voting for
the potential Leorio shows,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.470
but who's concerned about
how he will serve initially,

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.400
I will quell those concerns, even if it
requires me to leave the Zodiacs.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.330
Hey, hey, hey!

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.010
I have no idea what you people are talking about.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.590
But I'm in a hurry to save Gon
as quickly as possible!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.360
Leorio!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.180
Gon!

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.940
Damn!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.950
You had me so worried!

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.900
Leorio!

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.460
I'm so glad!

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.370
So glad!

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.110
Did I l look that bad?

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.220
Bad doesn't even begin to describe it!

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.690
Leorio, stop.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.330
He's healed now. Isn't that enough?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.240
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.870
Everyone was worried about you.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.840
Thank you... Thank you.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.600
He got us.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.180
Pariston wanted Leorio to be his final opponent!

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:02.300
Leorio no longer has the motive or
support to become chairman.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.020 line:20%
You become chairman!

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.310 line:20%
Who's the bald guy?

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.030
Leorio, you can't tell Gon that Killua healed him.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.780
Huh? Why not?

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.780
You can't tell him!

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.290
For Killua's sake, promise not to tell him.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.930
O-Okay, got it.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.540
Pariston, when?

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.620
When did you predict that this would happen?

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:31.890
Huh?

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.820
No, no...

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.110
I don't have the ability to predict anything.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.370
This was pure coincidence.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.690
Please tell me. I want to know.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.770
It hurts to admit this, but I've been defeated.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.820
It was when Ging-san said he
would run for chairman...

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.890
What?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.770
After he said he would run,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.920
I asked a question to provoke him.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.210
And he responded that Gon-kun wouldn't die, right?

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.520
Go visit him.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.710
He isn't going to die.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.220
In that moment,

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.730
I could see the scene that
just transpired before us.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.610
Well, I anticipated Ging-san
and I would stand on stage,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.700
and Ging-san would ultimately win.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.530
At least, in my vision.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.550
First, since Ging-san said Gon-kun wouldn't die,

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.990
I knew that meant there was a way to heal him.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:45.920
And that if he became part of the
election, I would never win.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.750
Do you understand?

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.190
That was the moment I was defeated.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.340
But Ging-san gave up on the election,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.600
then Leorio-san arrived, and hit him.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.100
When he stood on stage

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.680
and talked about his friends risking
their lives to save Gon-kun,

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.860
I finally saw the complete picture.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.360
I was assured of my victory a moment ago,

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.940
when I felt that immense power.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.620
I could sense that Gon-kun's friends had saved him.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.550
All that remained was to delay
the vote until he arrived.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.380
Oh, I'll retract the earlier motion,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.630
That was all the information you had?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.010
<i>You</i> put your trust in someone
you'd never met before?!

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.770
I trust Ging-san as an enemy.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:54.150
And these are the friends that
Ging-san trusted to save his son.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.400
I trust them.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.330
Why wouldn't I?

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.390
Run for chairman!

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.550
I'll vote for you!

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.180
Get on stage and say something!

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.300
Speech! Speech!

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.730
Man, I don't know what to do.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.050
Ging?

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.080
This is bad.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.000
But, well, this was always gonna happen...

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.340
Gon has finally caught sight of Ging's back.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.130
What will he say to him?

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.950
Next time: Chairman x And x Release.
