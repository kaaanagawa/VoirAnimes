WEBVTT

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.020
This is it.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.450
My brother sent the URL.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.200
Great!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
Let's get started.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.510
Yeah!

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.040
Gathering x Of x Heroes

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.420
As Kurapika obtains his ticket

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.270
to face the Phantom Troupe
and avenge the Kurta,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.610
Gon and Killua also prepare for the auction

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.820
in Yorknew City.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.270
This is the website for Hunters?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.910
Yeah, I've heard that Hunters
worldwide post information here.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.750
Worldwide?

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.030
Wow...

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.740
Please swipe your Hunter License,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.320
and enter your license code.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.030
Put the cursor on the bartender.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.210
What kind of information would you like?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.080
Wow! There's so much!

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.750
Select the game category.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.530
There it is.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.780
<i>Greed Island</i>.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.320
It will cost twenty million Jenny.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.060
Twenty million...

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.780
So they won't give out the
information for free.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.700
Well, we don't really have a choice.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.950
Deposit twenty million...

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.350
I can feel aura coming from the monitor!

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.780
I guess only <i>Nen</i> users can enter this site.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.220
Okay,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.380
now listen carefully.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.470
<i>Greed Island</i> is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.480
a game created by <i>Nen</i> practitioners.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.190
Apparently, there were multiple creators,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.290
but no one knows their objective.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.740
They put <i>Nen</i> into all hundred
copies of the game.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.130
When you start the game,
the <i>Nen</i> activates,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.490
pulling the player inside the game.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.380
Inside the game?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.120
Only <i>Nen</i> practitioners can play the game.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.880
And as long as the player stays
alive within the game,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.880
it will continue to run,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.230
even if the console is unplugged.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.700
It will stop if the player dies.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.140
One person who owned the game

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.890
hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.200
but none of them ever came back.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.650
I hear that you can return
if you find a save point.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.040
Is that true?

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.120
This information is from
the Hunter website.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.650
It's gotta be accurate.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.410
At the Yorknew City auction,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.410
seven copies of <i>Greed Island</i>
will be up for sale.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.790
The lowest starting bid is 8.9 billion Jenny.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.100
8.9 billion?!

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.990
The price has shot up!

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.420
That's 3 billion more than the retail price!

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.300
Difficulty of obtainment is G-rank.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.370
Huh?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.580
The game is considered a legend,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.600
but there are plenty of copies.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.310
If you have enough money,
it's relatively easy to procure.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.290
Hmm, a G...

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.810
Lower than I expected.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.070
The message is that if I can't
even get a simple game,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.820
I'll never be able to find you,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.130
Ging.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.830
Still, the money is a big problem.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.970
Hey, can we participate in the auction?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.110
They're starting at 8.9 billion!

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.280
That's out of our league.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.770
No, I mean by selling stuff.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.990
Selling?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.850
That's it!

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.600
We can look for treasure,
and then auction it off.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.730
Okay!

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.400
We can start with the 800 million we earned

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.360
at Heavens Arena, and go from there.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.610
Yep!

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.970
First, we'll start with online flea
markets and auction websites.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.860
And see

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.990
what we can dig up.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.370
We'll increase our money,
and get ourselves a copy of <i>Greed Island</i> !

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.250
Yeah!

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.560
Yay!

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.070
How much do we have left?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.860
Combined, we're at 10.84 million.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.750
Damn...

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.540
Initially, we were making a profit.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.640
That's why I said we should only
use trustworthy public sites.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.190
I couldn't help it!

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.120
Only the risky sites are profitable.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.080
It isn't working...

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.810
Now, show me what you've brought.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.300
The hair of the famous actress Sara,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.310
and a DNA test to validate authenticity.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.320
The right arm of an Egyptian mummy,
taken directly from a pyramid.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.570
The scaly skin of an ichthyosis patient.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.330
The skull of a one-horned creature.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.460
Okay, all four of you are hired.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.710
I'm Dalzollene, the head bodyguard.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.330
It's a pleasure.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.710
I'll need you to start working immediately.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.470
Your mission is to escort the boss
to a Yorknew City hotel room.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.970
A private aircraft will take you to
Lingon Airport, just outside Yorknew.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.980
The trip between airport and hotel

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.670
takes approximately ninety minutes.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.610
A special car has been prepared.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.180
You four will provide the
outer ring of security.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.740
Any questions?

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.860
Do you know who might
be targeting the boss?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.080
That question isn't worth an answer.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.330
What do you mean?

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.120
The boss is an important
figure in the underworld.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.050
There are plenty of people with
reasons to hold a grudge.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.130
Let me rephrase since you
didn't understand the first time.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.610
Regardless of grudges, do you know

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.240
anyone who might actually
commit to an attack?

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.270
If we can identify a few candidates, we'll know
their motives, styles, and circumstances,

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.910
and we can prepare accordingly.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.270
That will facilitate protecting the boss.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.770
You said that your name is Kurapika?

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.520
You are the one who doesn't understand.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.050
Our job is to protect the boss,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.060
no matter who, when,
where, or how they attack.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.280
That's all you need to know!

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.540
Don't bother building a mental profile.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.670
If anything comes too close, it's hostile.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.800
I'll introduce you to the boss.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.910
Come with me.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.290
Excuse me.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.480
What's that?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.870
It's a little too realistic.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.230
Yes, that is an actual human being.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.450
He was once a fellow bodyguard.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.890
He ignored my advice,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.950
and let himself be deceived
by false information,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.330
placing not only the other bodyguards,
but the boss in danger as well.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.880
So he was punished.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.710
You are replacing him.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.770
Let's go.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.560
Boss, I've brought the new bodyguards.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.230
Please enter.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.240
This is the boss, Neon-sama.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.820
Nice to meet you, everyone.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.850
Anyway, I was pretty surprised when
we were introduced to the boss.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.680
No kidding...

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.730
They called her an important
figure in the underworld,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.070
so I was expecting someone intimidating,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.060
but she turned out to be a cute little girl.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.440
Pakunoda, how's it going?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.100
Long time no see, Shalnark.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.740
You, too, Phinks.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.650
You sure took your time getting here.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.190
Oh?

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.920
I believe I'm right on schedule.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.090
You're supposed to arrive
ten minutes ahead of time.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.280
Same to you guys.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.650
Bonolenov!

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.410
Kortopi!

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.200
You guys are going with us, too?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.420
Yo!

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.780
Haven't seen your faces in a while.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.360
I'm here, chief.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.360
What's our target this time?

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.180
Give us our orders!

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.390
Don't be in such a rush, Uvo.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.380
Feitan's group won't arrive until evening.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.070
We'll wait until everyone's here.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.560
You have no patience.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.750
Damn, half a day of waiting.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.070
Oh?

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.130
Is that Shizuku?

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.570
Hello.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.620
Has the other new addition arrived yet?

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.330
No idea...

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.770
You should ask Machi.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.610
This is for September.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.680
Huh? So many?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.900
Yeah,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.870
Rotfelli-sama and Trinc-sama
would like their fortunes told.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.490
That just sucks.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.410
I told you to stop increasing my workload.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.310
I apologize.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.750
Both of them are friendly with your father.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.510
And what's Daddy doing?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.760
He had to attend a meeting.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.670
He's probably off playing golf or hunting.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.960
Daddy? This is Neon.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.470
What? No!

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.270
You can't fool me!

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.780
No.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.020
No!

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.460
Huh?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.570
Fine, you have to keep your word.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.030
If you break another promise, I'll quit.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.040
Yay! I get another piece of treasure!

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.340
A sweet deal.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.670
Congratulations.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.980
Okay...

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.420
Since that's settled, I'll get this over with.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.390
Angelic Auto Writing
Lovely Ghostwriter

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.660
I hear she's an incredible diviner.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.690
Thanks to her father's connections,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.540
she's made clients of some very
important people in the underworld.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.050
No, it's the other way around.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.390
Other way around?

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.590
I'd say that the father has used
his daughter to increase

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.800
his standing in the underworld.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.180
That's why he is frightened of losing her.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.510
Afraid that his enemies

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.570
might strike back at his daughter.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.150
Okay, all done.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.360
Here.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.070
Excellent work.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.820
Say, tomorrow's auction starts at night, right?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.700
I want to do some shopping beforehand.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.700
Very well, I shall accompany you.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.830
How many years has it been

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.720
since all thirteen Troupe members gathered,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.760
Feitan?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.210
Three years, two months.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.210
However, two members have since changed.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.230
#4 and #8 are now different people.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.940
Machi, will #4,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.240
Hisoka, actually show up today?

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.050
No idea.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.530
Don't ask me.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.360
Wasn't he your responsibility?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.490
I was only supposed to tell him to come.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.720
I don't like Hisoka.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.700
Why does the chief let
him do as he pleases?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.490
Because he has skills.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.460
Skills, huh?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.190
His Bungee Gum is quite impressive.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.510
It would be difficult to counter.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.390
What's your point?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.890
Are you claiming that the
chief is afraid of Hisoka?

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.380
I won't let that statement stand.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.140
That's not what I meant.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.400
You're all being too generous.
He's nothing special.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.360
Talk is cheap, as always.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.050
Nobunaga,

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.670
this is what happens when I
keep quiet and let you yap.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.420
You were talking as much as I was, Franklin.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.230
And so it begins.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.520
Ignore them.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.430
They're just playing around again.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.680
Anyway, why is the chief
calling everyone together?

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.380
We're thieves.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.640
There's something he wants us to steal.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.350
Well, I know that much.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.470
Yes, we've arrived at the hotel.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.200
However, one of the lady's
fortunes concerned me...

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.200
"An underground chamber
where everything costs extra.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.720
That is where you will sleep.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.420
Never descend stairs that
you didn't first ascend.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.210
Do not compete with others at numbers."

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.250
There were three other poems
that begin with this verse.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.470
Meaning that all four clients
received the same fortune.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.220
The only thing connecting them

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.730
is that they will be attending the
underground auction this year.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.120
So the fortune is saying that
their lives are at risk,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.610
should they participate?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.830
I'm assuming that "sleep" is a metaphor

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.860
for succumbing to illness or death.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.580
I understand.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.870
I will pass the fortunes on to the clients.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.120
One more thing.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.000
The lady never remembers
the fortunes she's told,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.880
and she cannot tell her own fortune.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.630
Does it make sense to let her
participate in the auction?

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.720
No!

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.940
Bring her back immediately!

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.760
However, I will need a proper
explanation, or she'll never listen.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.810
If she throws a tantrum,
we won't be able to stop her.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.360
In any case, don't take her
to the auction site.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.520
Send some bodyguards to place bids.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.060
I understand.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.730
Neon...

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.580
He's not coming.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.600
The sun's about to rise.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.670
Damn Hisoka...

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.530
Next time I see him, I'll tear him apart.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.430
Oh, dear...

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.210
That sounds quite gruesome.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.440
How very scary.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.480
Hisoka, you bastard!

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.060
You're late.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.570
Man, I thought you weren't going to come.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.070
You asked me to come...

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.400
Had I broken my promise,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.950
I would never get to see
your Nen Stitches again.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.330
Chief, everyone's here.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.300
Chief, what are we stealing this time?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.850
We shall take the underground
auction's treasures.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.970
Which ones?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.850
Ancient texts?
Because the chief likes books.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.730
No, I'm thinking games.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.700
There will be multiple copies of the
most expensive game ever for sale.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.860
Wouldn't it be logical to take
precious metals and gemstones?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.810
Everything.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.870
We're taking everything
that's up for auction.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.620
Are you serious, chief?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.270
The underground auction is run by
gangs from across the world.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:59.470
If we do that, we'll be making
enemies of them all...

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.010
Are you frightened, Uvogin?

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.260
I'm thrilled!

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.270
I'm shaking with excitement...

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.520
Give us the command, chief!

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.020
Right now!

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.990
You have my permission...

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.180
Kill them.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.440
Kill every person who interferes.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.420
Good work.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.760
I have your next assignment.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.480
You must win the three items on this list
at the underground auction.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.770
Money is no object.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.190
The complete mummy of Princess Corco.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.730
A tissue used by the actor, Son Remarch.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.800
Complete with DNA validation.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.320
And...

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.070
The eyeballs of a Kurta, also known

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.570
as scarlet eyes.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:11.210
Also, we've received information that
there will be an attack on the auction.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.240
Prepare for any unexpected complications,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.590
while focusing on the primary
objective of obtaining these items.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.800
They're coming.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.600
They are definitely coming!

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.160
Kurapika awaits his chance
to avenge his brethren.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.190
The Phantom Troupe,
a band of murdering thieves.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.570
The sun has risen on the first day

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.450
of the auction, where all sides will soon clash.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.440
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:16.000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.910
Today, we introduce Neon!

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.940
She's the Nostrade family head's daughter.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.910
Has the <i>Nen</i> ability to tell
others' fortunes via poems.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.170
She likes to collect human trophies.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.080
Her <i>Nen</i> ability is called Lovely Ghostwriter.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:16.000
The most important member
of the Nostrade Family.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.320
I would try to tell my own fortune.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.170
But she can't do that.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.720
Next time: Defend x And x Attack!

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.720
Hey, Killua, are you better
at defending or attacking?

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.900
What do you think?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.470
Hmm, attacking?

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.430
Bingo.
