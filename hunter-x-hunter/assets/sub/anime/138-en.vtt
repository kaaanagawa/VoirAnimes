WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.190
All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.860
I'm not looking for any trouble.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.730
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.540
to change the result?

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.750
If I can get my target to move as I want,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.540
I've succeeded as a Hunter.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
Request x And x Wish

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.000
On August 8th at 12:00 AM,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.710
in the Hunter Association main headquarters,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.760
the voting to elect Netero's successor,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.700
the 13th Chairman, began.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.510
Heart <c.color434340>Is Valuable</c>

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.520
The rules set by Ging

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.890
made all of the six hundred and sixty-one members

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.260
both a candidate and voter.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.470
On this day,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.360
voter turnout was below the required 95%,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.150
meaning the vote had to be redone.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.150
1) Pariston
2) Cheadle
3) Ickshonpe
4) Botobai

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.230
However, the second vote

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.170
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 251 (37.9%)
2) Cheadle — 46
3) Ickshonpe — 28
4) Botobai — 27
5) Mizaistom — 24

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.160
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora — 10
12) Loupe — 9
13) Linne, Biscuit — 8
15) Tsezguerra — 7
16) Knov, Kanzai — 6
18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, Geru, 13 others — 3
35) Saiyu, 11 others — 2
47) Gon, Hanzo, 16 others — 1

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.660
also failed to meet the requirements,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.660
Invalid — 45                    Absent — 33
Turnout — 88.2%

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.660
Vote must be retaken because
requirements were not met.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.670
and had to be redone again.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.420
Taking the results from the
two votes into consideration...

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.790
First, we will have Beans-san review all ballots

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.180
before they are entered, to reduce
the number of invalid votes.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.430
Second,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.940
Hunters who violate the rules by
abstaining or submitting invalid votes

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.280
will have their licenses temporarily taken away.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.690
Those are my two suggestions.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.310
If we implement the first,
do we still need the second?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.200
Just getting rid of the invalid
votes would put us over 95%.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.760
I wouldn't be so sure...

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.750
Some Hunters may play hooky when they
learn they can't submit invalid votes.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.190
There are those who would trample
on the former chairman's wishes.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.060
What?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.450
Drop it. You'll only waste time.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.460
Oh? Did I say something wrong?

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.550
The former chairman declared that
a 95% turnout was required,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.600
so Hunters who submit invalid votes or
won't vote are betraying his memory.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.350
They just don't want to see you become chairman!

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.020
Then they should vote for someone else.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.510
I'm sure there are other qualified candidates.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.110
Though that isn't how the majority of Hunters feel...

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.490
Is that too hard for you, with your limited
vocabulary and math skills?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.120
I told you that you'd only waste time.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.630
You get a warning, Kanzai.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.020
Before adding new rules,
I believe we should broadcast

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.880
each candidate's message.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.050
Besides, abstaining and submitting invalid
votes are not technically violations.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.030
I fully agree with your first statement,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.140
but the second makes me
wonder if I heard right...

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.340
I cannot believe those words came from one

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.150
of the former chairman's leading supporters.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.050
The former chairman said

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.560
that the difficulty of this election was D-rank.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.780
Which means, for us Hunters with stars,
this should be a simple task.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.290
In other words, the former chairman
trusted us to handle this.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.740
Pariston, you're a pain!

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.290
Don't talk! Keep your mouth shut!

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.310
The difficulty level is just his way of
expressing his degree of trust in the Zodiacs.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.940
If it's S, he's encouraging us.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.510
If it's F, he's challenging us.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.760
You can spin it however you want,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.930
but abstaining and submitting invalid
votes don't violate any rules, scumbag.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.210
When I called them violations...

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.710
I was only insinuating that those
Hunters are mistaken in their manner

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.060
of paying respects to the former chairman.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.990
The message is that making the election
a success would be the right way

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.810
to pay our respects to him.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.890
Then, say that during your speech!

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.070
If you make it a rule, that's coercion!

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.510
Is coercion such a bad thing?

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.710
Okay, I get the idea...

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.940
That's enough.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.330
I'm fine with both suggestions.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.410
My reasons are different than yours,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.480
but I agree that, barring
extraordinary circumstances,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.190
no Hunters should be abstaining
or submitting invalid votes.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.640
Then let's take a vote.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.850
First things first.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.240
I hope you aren't going to say that,
during that time, Hunters who

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.590
have their licenses taken away
aren't considered pro Hunters.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.230
You aren't that stupid, are you?

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.730
Of course not...

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.140
I wouldn't think of using such underhanded
logic to manipulate the vote.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.490
Their licenses will be confiscated. Nothing more.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.850
What if they're lost?

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.640
A Hunter who has lost his license

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.240
may be protected by the rules,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.380
but is not qualified to be a pro
as far as we're concerned, yes?

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.130
Uh...

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.580
Are you saying that someone

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.450
would use the threat of a license going
missing to manipulate the vote?

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.890
We can't guarantee no one will do that.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.140
Let this be clearly recorded in the minutes...

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.900
Hunters who lose their licenses during the election

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.530
will not lose their right to vote.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.060
That way, no one can manipulate
the turnout or the majority.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.950
I hate to admit it,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.540
but unless we do something about
the majority, not just the turnout,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.290
Pariston will keep smiling.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.820
6) Saccho
7) Ginta
8) Morel
9) Piyon, Cluck
11) Cutie, Sanbica

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.620
He already seems to have secured the votes

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.120
that went to Ginta, Piyon, and Cluck.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.710
6) Saccho
7) Morel
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora
12) Loupe

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.030
If our timing is wrong, there will be casualties.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.830
I hate to admit it...

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.270
But some part of me

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.580
wishes that Ging were here.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.250
A beast that cannot be tamed...

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.660
Why did the Chairman select
him as Vice Chairman?

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.210
Since I get to choose my second-in-command,

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.350
choosing a yes-man wouldn't be any fun.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.100
It should be someone I can't stand...

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.450
That is who I want at my side.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.360
Chairman,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.600
I still believe you made a mistake.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.910
Young Killua has returned?

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.050
That's great...

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.900
When I saw his name on the list of Hunters
who didn't vote, I was worried.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.240
How's he doing?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.460
He's opened Testing Gates 1 through 5?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.400
Actually, his expression was what concerned me.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.010
He looked very distressed...

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.360
I couldn't bring myself to speak to him.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.410
If you run into his friend there,
can you relay a message?

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.400
Ask him to help young Killua.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.040
Well...

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.170
His friend is why he's upset.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.820
What? Gon-kun?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.930
Young Killua...

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.920
Let me see Alluka.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.800
I need her power.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.240
Killua...

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.930
I don't have time, Dad!

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.130
I'll go even if you try to stop me, so come with me.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.740
It's useless.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.430
No one can control Alluka.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.420
That's wrong!

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.060
You're wrong... Brother's wrong...

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.900
Alluka's a member of the family!

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.070
She isn't a machine!

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.810
As her brother, I'm asking her for help!

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.420
For help?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.830
That child

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.080
is not human.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.960
You shouldn't consider

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.460
that thing to be a member of the family.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.710
What did you say?

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.240
That thing

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.170
is something that came

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.050
from somewhere else.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.890
Sit.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.540
If someone tries to dispel the restriction
and covenant Gon set for himself,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.400
they'll be either repelled or killed.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.690
If Alluka hasn't changed,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.660
I'm the only one who can help her.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.660
And Alluka's the only one who can save Gon.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.290
Promise me one thing.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.590
Never betray your friends.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.180
If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help,
wouldn't I be betraying him?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.180
Come with me.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.040
I'm sure you already know this,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.390
but no new requests have been made.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.470
Who made the last wish?

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.390
Milluki.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.820
He asked for the newest computer
available at the time.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.420
He made the wish himself in Alluka's
presence, so he couldn't lie.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.100
A computer shouldn't be that bad...

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.090
Was it because Illumi was controlling me?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.670
How could I leave my little
sister in this situation?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.550
Killua, I want to go over this again.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.840
When making a wish to Alluka,
what are the rules?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.500
It's not necessary...

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.760
I know Alluka better than anyone.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.560
It's necessary.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.590
Have you forgotten how many people have died?

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.290
We've killed more people!

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.190
Killua,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.400
if you can't stay calm, we're stopping now.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:09.950
Our promise matters to me because
I care about you, as your father.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.210
Can you go over the rules for me?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.650
Alluka is...

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.840
Mitsuba... Mitsuba!

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.100
Carry me.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.330
Yes, yes... I will!

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.110
There!

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.960
Climb the stairs!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.190
Yes, yes.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.110
Raise me up high!

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.860
Yes, yes.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.100
There you go!

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.280
Mitsuba...

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.620
Yes, yes? What is it, Master Alluka?

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.260
Yes... Master Alluka's
face suddenly changed!

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.640
Yeah, it's okay. I can handle this.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.460
Alluka, lift me up high!

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.890
'Kay.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.890
Up high...

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.900
Up high...

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.570
'Kay.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.900
See? She's back.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.230
Keep this a secret from everyone.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.400
Oh, I already told your mother...

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.160
What?

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.460
But it was our secret!

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.790
It happens after three requests are fulfilled...

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.290
Yep, her eyes turn black.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.750
And they turn back after Alluka lifts you up high?

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:49.430
No, then Alluka grants a wish.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.690
I didn't understand at first...

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.050
So I wished for her to tell me
how to turn her eyes back,

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.940
and Alluka told me.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.690
Do you remember the exact words Alluka said?

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.200
After she grants a wish, her eyes turn white.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.700
And when three of her requests
are fulfilled, they turn black.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.960
Refuse any requests that Alluka makes.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.690
No matter how small they are.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.980
Yes, I understand.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.010
Mitsuba... Carry me!

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.630
I can't do that, Master.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.210
Then, Mitsuba, shake my hand.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.400
Oh, um...

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.640
I can't do that, Master.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.770
I'm sorry.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.740
Then I want a piggyback ride, Mitsuba.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.470
I'm sorry... I can't.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.950
What should I do?

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.300
Come on, Master!

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.640
Let's go catch some bugs.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.500
Okay?

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.010
Then, Mitsuba, lift me up high.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.160
I can't do that, either, Mast—

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.470
Mitsuba was in the play area...

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.900
Hasamu was in the butlers' quarters.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.420
So two people, in different locations,

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.410
were instantly crushed at the same time...

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.420
What is happening?

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.410
It's because she refused.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.920
She refused four of Alluka's requests.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.300
Yasuha, piggyback ride!

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.430
Yes, Master.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.990
Master Alluka...

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.000
Can you make me

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.220
a millionaire?

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.520
'Kay.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.770
'Kay.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.550
There has been a mysterious incident
in which an airship transporting money

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:51.060
suddenly went missing, and when it
was found, all the money was gone.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.760
The pilot and crew members have
provided baffling explanations.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.250
It will take a while to determine the cause.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.290
I'm very sorry!

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.050
I couldn't help myself...

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.000
I find it hard to believe that
this was just a coincidence.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.970
When Alluka is with us...

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.760
He never makes any requests.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.740
Dad, can you let me choose the next butler?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.250
So your mission is to fulfill Alluka's requests.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.270
Yes... I understand.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:36.100
If you clear this mission,
I will spare you and your lover.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.340
Hey, Kasuga...

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.540
Yes, what is it?

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.040
Give me your liver.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.010
Um, that's not...

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.490
You know?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.290
You won't do it?

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.300
Then, Kasuga, give me your duodenum.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.190
Please wait, Master...

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.850
Let's play a different game! Okay?

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.980
You won't do it?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.100
Then, Kasuga, give me your spine.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.940
Master!

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.440
Master... Please...

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.950
Then, Kasuga...

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.660
Give me your brain.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:35.070
When three of Alluka's requests are
fulfilled, she'll grant one wish.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.240
There probably isn't any limit
to the wishes she can grant.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.720
My guess is that she can grant any wish.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.230
Wish

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.230
But the bigger the wish she grants...

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.480
Request 1

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.900
Request 1                   Request 2

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.730
The bigger the next three requests will be.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.610
Request 3                  Request 1           Request 2

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.150
In other words, an equivalent exchange.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.870
And the sacrifice isn't made by the
one whose wish was granted.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.210
It's the next person who fulfills the requests.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.370
Request 1                             Request 2

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.300
If someone denies four of
Alluka's requests in a row,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.250
that person and their most loved one,

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.250
meaning a minimum of two people, will die.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.520
The bigger the wish, the more people
die when the requests aren't fulfilled.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.640
After that wish, sixty-seven people died,
and those are just the ones we knew of.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.760
Thinking of the family that
has been separated...

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.900
Thinking of the friend who is dying...

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.300
What will Killua do next?

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.440
Next time: Alluka x And x Something.
