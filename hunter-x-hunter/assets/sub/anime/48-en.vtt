WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No good...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
I've got nothing.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.980
That two billion reward
per spider is attractive,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.670
but finding them will be impossible.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.670
Yeah...

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.050
Hey, we could ask for concrete
information on the Net.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.000
Like about the Troupe's current location.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.250
We could offer a large reward.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.640
Hold on...

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.490
We don't have the money for that.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.500
It'll be fine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.050
Very x Sharp x Eye

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.680
Gon and his friends are
pursuing the Phantom Troupe,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980
and have now obtained the money

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
to buy the information they need.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.900
That's crazy...

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.940
You actually have money.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.900
Man, you really pawned
your Hunter License?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
You're insane.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.280
So, what should we do first?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.790
Let's start by purchasing
a Southernbees catalog.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.120
Here is this year's
Southernbees auction catalog.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.160
Thanks.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.580
There it is!

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.870
<i>Greed Island</i> !

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.180
Seven total copies on sale...

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.440
The minimum starting bid is 8.9 billion.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.850
Just as expected.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.200
Now we wait for the
information to come in.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.330
First, we catch one of the spiders
and make them tell us where

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.470
the rest are hiding,
so that we can bag them all!

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.200
Huh?

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.710
What's wrong, Gon?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.210
This is...

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.330
Oh, a Ben's knife.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.590
A Ben's knife?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.440
A hundred years ago,
a mass murderer designed it.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.990
He was a famous blacksmith.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.310
This is one of his original works.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.510
It's a lesser-known piece that a
lot of rabid collectors are after.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.300
So, you recognized it.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.440
No, I didn't.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.290
Huh?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.070
It happened to catch my eye,
so I got curious

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.810
and I used <i>Gyo</i>.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.960
That's when I noticed a faint aura on it.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.700
<i>Gyo</i> ?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.580
A form of <i>Nen</i>.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.830
Basically, you look really
hard at something.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.930
You're right.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.340
Let me have a look.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.840
Nope, I don't see a thing.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.710
You will, once you spend
more time training in <i>Ren</i>.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.260
Right! There's another way!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.250
Another way?

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.680
Another way to make money.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.810
Remember how four-eyes mentioned that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.820
really talented people use <i>Nen</i> without
even realizing it themselves?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.820
Four-eyes?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.820
Wing-san.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.570
He taught us <i>Nen</i>.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.050
If we search for items with
aura on them, like this knife,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.710
it's likely some genius made them.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.210
I get it!

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.010
We can find hidden gems

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.340
with no formal appraisal training.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.090
Then we auction the items at a higher price!

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.840
If you guys want that,
write down your price.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.980
Customers are supposed to
name their own prices?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.230
Yeah, that's how this market works.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.020
You write down what you're willing to pay,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.480
and when time expires,
the highest bidder wins the item.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.610
Understand? Popular items

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.260
will see their prices shoot up.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.120
I get it now.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.930
Well, then let's get started.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.780
I'll check the online forums.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.570
Okay!

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.410
This is a weird pot, but I detect aura...

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.020
Someone already bid!

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.270
If a bid has already been placed,
enter one that's 2.5 times higher.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.780
Even if you end up bidding too high,
you'll succeed in discouraging any rivals.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.280
500 multiplied by 2.5...

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.360
Let's see...

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.560
It's the same person!

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.480
Same on your side?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.550
I found a couple items,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.680
but both had bids already placed by "Zepile."

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.030
And after I entered a bid 2.5 times higher,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.640
he multiplied that by 4.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.930
Then it isn't a coincidence?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.590
No.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.890
What should we do?

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.940
Keep placing bids until the deadline.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.590
There are two of us, so we'll win some!

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.020
Okay.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.870
So ultimately, we won three and lost one.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.450
Yeah, he got that weird pot.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.470
Well, that wasn't too bad.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.520
Let's take these to the auction house now.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.000
I am very sorry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.010
But the auction house cannot
accept any additional items,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.220
once the catalog has been published.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.060
Isn't there any way?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.730
We really want to auction these.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.120
I suggest that you give
the trade market a try.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.620
The trade market?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.800
The trade market...

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.870
Professionals will be here, so if one of these
is genuine, we should get a great price.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.490
I wanted to sell these at the auction, though.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.120
How much do you think we'll get?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.380
Let's find out.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.260
Oh, you found these in your cellar?

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.540
Yep!

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.350
Dad said to sell them if the price was right.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.280
These are wonderful pieces.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.020
Only fifty copies were printed, and yours has

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.250
a single-digit serial number.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.520
And an authentic autograph.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.600
We know.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.950
That's where the aura was coming from.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.450
I'd guess it's worth at least 150,000.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.780
This antique doll is also excellent...

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.200
It's in great shape,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.540
and the pristine condition of both
box and doll raises the value.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.390
I'm estimating 300,000.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.670
However,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.670
this one isn't worth much, unfortunately.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.680
Huh?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.680
The box and statue are
from different periods.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.770
The box was made recently.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.270
The statue is rough and doesn't
adhere to any theme.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.190
I'd say it's only worth 1,500 Jenny.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.190
But there is a little aura...

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.480
However, that would be its
appraisal as an artwork.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.390
The wood itself is quite valuable.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.200
So I'll make you an offer.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.530
If you sell me the painting
and doll for 420,000,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.710
I'll buy the wood for 80,000.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.240
A total of 500,000?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.340
What do you think?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.720
Feel free to think it over.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.720
But I doubt anyone will quote
you a better price.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.720
In the meantime, let me
check this wood's age.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.220
Wait!

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.900
Put down that statue.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.480
Wh-Who are you?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.070
Don't let him scam you, kid.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.520
He's offering a fair price
for the painting and doll,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.490
but he's lying about the statue!

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.520
I-I never lied!

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.240
Really?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.660
No collector would pay
80,000 for that wood.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.000
You're interested in

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.620
the contents of that statue!

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.400
It's a wooden trove.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.840
A wooden trove?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.690
Three hundred years ago,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.540
these were a popular way for the
wealthy to hide their money.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.230
To hide their money...

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.320
If it's real, there should be valuables inside.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.490
You planned to steal the contents,
while pretending to check its age!

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.970
I-I would never do that...

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.120
Wait.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.850
Can you prove that this is
a genuine wooden trove?

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.120
What?

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.320
The wood is certainly over
three hundred years old.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.510
But that only tells us the material's age.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.330
The statue itself could be modern.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.710
This technique is known as hoodwinking, boys.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.140
Technique?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.520
He's referring to a counterfeiter trying
to trick a professional appraiser.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.020
But that isn't what I'm doing.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.320
Here's a seam that an amateur

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.030
would never recognize.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.690
The seam contains an adhesive

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.280
used back in that period.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.890
You're insisting this is a real wooden trove?

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.910
Yeah.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.410
But it is possible that it was opened
once to swap out its contents,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.170
and the statue was reassembled.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.670
We'd call that a dud.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.380
It's called double-dipping,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.430
placing new adhesive on top
of the old to create a dud.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.930
But only an amateur would try that.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.570
A professional would melt
the adhesive with a flame,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.940
before resealing it.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.200
That way, it would appear as though
the statue had never been opened.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.140
That's known as welding.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.820
It hasn't been welded.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:21.450
If fire were used, the wood would be scarred
or the adhesive would have discolored.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.830
Even the pros have a hard time
weighing those details.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.800
I can't trust you.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.380
I'm a pro appraiser!

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.960
I swear by my eyes...

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.630
This is a real wooden trove!

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.670
It's never been opened,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.760
and the treasure inside
hasn't been swapped out!

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.360
Okay,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.020
let's assume that this is a
genuine wooden trove.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.450
If the contents have been swapped out,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.150
what would you do?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.030
I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.310
Give up.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.790
Wow! Awesome!

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.560
Oh, so you're Zepile.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.960
Thanks, Zepile-san.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.860
You don't need to thank me.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.010
Consider it give and take.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.320
Twenty percent sounds fair.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.120
Huh?

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.030
My cut when you sell the treasure.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.860
What?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.700
You're going to rob us?!

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.910
That's uncalled for.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.450
It's my fee for providing advice.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.120
I don't see a problem.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.990
He helped us back there.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.460
Now, look here...

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.060
We need to collect as much
Jenny as we possibly can.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.360
I might be willing to buy him lunch.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.300
Really?

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.970
Then I'll settle for that.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.220
Huh?

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.230
So, Zepile-san...

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.270
Hmm?

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.960
I feel bad, so we'll pay you a fee.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.610
There you go again!

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.180
Nah, it really is okay.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.480
In return, just tell me something.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.110
What tipped you off to bid on these items?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.940
Is it okay to tell him the truth?

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.370
Well, it beats paying him.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.870
I see, <i>Nen</i> aura...

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.680
If you're telling the truth,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.150
that explains why you bought the statue,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.130
not realizing something was hidden inside.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.890
So, why do you need money so badly?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.280
We can answer that question,
but not for free.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.670
Afterwards, you have to answer our question.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.270
Sure, that's fine.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.360
There's an item we want
to buy at the auction.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.520
That's why we need money.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.990
Oh, which item are you interested in?

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.900
It's our turn now.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.460
You estimated that this treasure
was worth 300 million, right?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.290
Could we receive that much
at the trade market?

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.370
At the trade market?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.700
They mainly deal in hard cash...

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.550
If you show up abruptly,
you won't get a fair price.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.560
What?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.660
Seriously?

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.000
Now it's my turn.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.590
I'll repeat the question.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.960
Which item do you want?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.310
A game called <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.310
Oh, that ridiculously expensive game?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.820
How much is that weird pot
that you bought worth?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.800
Huh? This?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.370
It's garbage.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.700
Nothing at all.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.100
Why do you want that expensive game?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.170
I believe it costs 6 billion?

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.950
The asking price is 8.9 billion.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.100
We're looking for his dad.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.960
That game has a clue inside.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.570
Oh...

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.530
Why did you choose that pot?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.250
If you knew the wooden trove was real,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.830
shouldn't you have bid on
the more valuable item?

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.220
But you went for the pot.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.350
Why?

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.120
You see...

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.600
I made this pot.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.860
Huh?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.770
But it wasn't an original creation.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.050
It was a replica.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.860
In other words, a counterfeit.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.160
When I was destitute,
this was how I made Jenny.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.990
Once I became an appraiser
and began earning money,

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.700
I quit doing that.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.520
When I see how poorly these are made,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.880
I feel mortified!

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.630
So I browse the markets and buy them back.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.750
How much would a real one cost?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.580
It's my turn.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.270
What does your dad do?

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.140
He's a pro Hunter.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.400
How much would a real one cost?!

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.960
Forty to fifty thousand.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.180
Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.860
There are a few in the antiques world,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.030
and not one of them is ordinary.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.950
Won't it be impossible for you
two to find him alone?

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.920
It'll be fine.
I'm a pro Hunter, too.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.670
Huh? Seriously?

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.670
Okay, your turn to ask a question.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.160
Okay, this is my final question.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.930
Can I help you with anything?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.970
Huh?

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.690
If you want to make money at an auction,
you'll need an appraiser.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.710
You could even say that with an appraiser,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.100
you can always turn a profit.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.190
You can set the price you want to pay me.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.110
How's that?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.450
Then you have to answer our last question.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.300
Why do you want to help us?

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.720
Because it made me happy...

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.350
It made me happy that this piece of junk

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.840
actually caught your eye.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.720
It's not a piece of junk!

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.470
It definitely holds your <i>Nen</i>.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.850
Everyone has some aura...

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.480
But it's incredibly difficult to harness!

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.430
You must concentrate and
train for a very long time.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.860
I can tell how much effort you
put into making that pot!

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.820
You have a lot of talent!

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.870
I still think it's a weird pot, though.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.880
My eyes didn't deceive me.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.710
When you appraise objects long enough,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.880
you also become a good judge of character.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.530
I look at the sellers and the buyers too,
not just the merchandise.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.070
It's a lot harder to appraise humans

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.730
than it is to appraise antiques.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.580
When I saw you, I knew right away...

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.400
That I wanted to work with you.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.290
That's my answer.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.590
What's yours?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.940
Looking forward to it.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.660
We'll decide your fee after
we see how you do.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.470
Okay! With that settled...

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.680
But first...

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.290
Huh?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.200
Teach me those techniques

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.300
you talked about earlier.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.440
You're interested?

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.180
Yep!

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.900
Hoodwinking, double-dipping, welding...

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.710
What else is there?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.850
Seriously...

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.680
That isn't important at all!

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.680
But they sound fun!
Like magic tricks!

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.750
We're not here to have fun!

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.200
Now I understand why this kid interests me.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.200
He doesn't care about right or wrong.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.950
When I admitted to making forgeries

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.960
and when that trader gave me a hard time...

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.020
He didn't react with accusatory glares

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.460
or by plotting his own evil deeds.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.210
His reaction was very simple.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.360
Innocent curiosity!

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.720
He opens his mind to everything that
impresses him, right or wrong.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.730
Which means that he's dangerous...

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.090
Someone who can never truly be appraised.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.740
Welding is the hardest
technique to see through.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.480
But recently, a new technique has surfaced.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.750
It's known as exposing.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.520
You plainly reveal the opened statue

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.500
along with a fake treasure.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.130
Because people assume

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.110
that you wouldn't open the statue
if the treasure were fake,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.010
you can fool them.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.270
But now this technique is getting old.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.710
When people started to get suspicious,
a new technique emerged.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.020
Can you guess what it is?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.340
I know.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.220
The treasure inside is also fake!

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.260
Wrong!

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.300
I know!

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.410
Remove the treasure from a different place!

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.760
Bingo!

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.510
You can create a new opening
and remove the treasure,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.270
then insert the fake
treasure and seal the hole.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.170
This is known as side-stepping.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.610
Side-stepping...

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.990
Many veteran appraisers have been fooled.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.280
They assume the statue is real if the
adhesive hasn't changed color

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.810
from the application of fire.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.760
That's how they fool the pros.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.250
You live in an incredible world.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.500
Hello?

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.070
What? A spider?

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.570
Yeah, this looks real.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.970
There's a video attached.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.200
We have two targets.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.200
A man and a woman.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.550
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.710
Got it.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.680
Let's go, Killua.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.480
Yeah.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.720
Hey! What about the auction?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.160
We'll let you handle it!

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.970
Try to get us a good price!

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.220
Huh?

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.230
Okay! I've got it covered!

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.750
Gon and Killua have learned
about a whole new world.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.280
And they are about to make
contact with the Phantom Troupe.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.280
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.740
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.700
It's Gon

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.480
and Killua's

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.710
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:16.000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.340
Today, we introduce Shizuku.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.740
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.320
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.190
She can conjure the vacuum cleaner Blinky.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:16.000
Conjurer who uses a conjured
vacuum named Blinky.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.620
But it can't suck up anything alive.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.120
Its capacity is immeasurable!

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.910
Where do you go if you're sucked in?

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.290
No one knows.
