00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.360
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.610
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.830
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.550
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.580
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.040
What's this?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.730
Something Ging left with me.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.770
Huh?

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.060
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.020
My dad left this for me...

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.020
Reply x From x Dad

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.530
The box that had been sealed with <i>Nen</i>

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530
contained three mysterious items.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.930
One of them, an old cassette tape,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.250
gave Gon his first chance

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.590
to hear his father's voice.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.790
Yo, Gon...

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.700
So you became a Hunter, too.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.550
This is my dad's voice.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.680
Anyway, I have a question for you.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.030
Do you want to see me?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.820
If you do, keep on listening.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.510
If you don't, press the stop button.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.470
I'm guessing that's a "yes."

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.460
Then I'll ask you once more.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.080
Are you prepared?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.680
Hunters are selfish creatures.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.470
They're willing to sacrifice
anything to get what they want.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.290
If you're only slightly interested in seeing me,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.850
you should stop the tape now.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.900
I'll give you a minute to consider it.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.550
Well?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.830
I guess you really do want to see me.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.430
But I don't want to see you.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.020
I don't know how I could face you now.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.180
After all, I chose my own desires

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.710
over my parental duty.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.970
I'm a bad person.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.730
I'm guessing that by the time
you hear this tape,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.770
at least ten years will have passed.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.850
But one thing still hasn't changed.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.620
I'm still me.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.730
Bo!

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.230
As you listen to this tape,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.960
I'm off doing reckless things.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.810
If you want to see me, find me.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.510
But as I said before, I don't want to see you.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.320
If I sense you nearby,
I'll make myself scarce.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.960
Catch me if you can.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.820
You are a Hunter, aren't you?

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.550
Your dad isn't gonna be easy to track.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.920
Oh, wait...

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.870
Ging's still there.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.040
Oh, I forgot to mention something...

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.600
It's about your mother.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.600
If you want to know more, keep listening.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.370
If you're not interested...

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.800
Are you sure?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.860
Yeah.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.360
But he might have left you a clue.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.170
I doubt it.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.230
That's what my gut tells me.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.370
Besides, I already told you...

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.000
My mom is Mito-san.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.940
I see.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.640
Are you hungry?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.020
I'll go grab something.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.990
Yeah.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.500
Hey, Gon!

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.640
The tape started moving

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.790
all by itself!

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.600
What?!

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.940
There's aura around the tape player!

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.530
It's <i>Nen</i>...
<i>Nen</i> is rewinding the cassette!

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.250
<i>Nen</i> ?

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.030
Is he nearby?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.120
No, he infused this player with
<i>Nen</i> over ten years ago!

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.770
So it would start rewinding,
once it was stopped!

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.870
Why?

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.040
Beats me.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.670
Now it's recording!

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.560
I get it! He's erasing his message!

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.670
What?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.100
It's not working!

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.530
I can't stop it...

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.620
Damn!

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.180
It still won't stop!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.030
I pulled the plug!

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.170
Sorry, Gon.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.570
I'll have to break it!

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.850
Damn!

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.900
No good!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.550
There's <i>Nen</i> protecting the player!

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.330
It's finished.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.230
Now it's recording!

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.680
I get it! He's erasing his message!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.740
What?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.480
The other tape was also wiped.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.320
Why would he go to all this trouble?

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.340
I'm guessing he didn't want to leave any clues.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.720
Clues?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.940
You can extract a lot of information
from an audio clip.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.830
Really?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.870
You can determine the
speaker's height, weight,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.710
gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.060
and state of mind.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.560
From the background noise,
you can also determine the location.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.820
But he was more worried
about something else.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.100
Something else?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.480
Nen.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.930
I wouldn't be surprised if
there were a <i>Nen</i> user

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.410
somewhere who could analyze
data better than a machine.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.410
Someone who would

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.550
know everything about a person
just from hearing their voice.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.240
Oh, I get it.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.750
Your dad's a tough nut.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.160
Since the tape's useless now,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.360
we only have two clues left...

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.460
The ring and the memory card.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.980
I doubt the ring will help,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.640
but the memory card could be important.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.780
Yeah, it's smaller than a normal memory card.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.640
Maybe you need a special machine to use it?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.480
Huh? You can't tell?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.150
This memory card only works with the JS.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.780
The JS?

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.810
A gaming console called the JoyStation.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.150
It's three generations old.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.280
You don't know anything, do you?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.530
If this island still has tape players,
it probably has a console.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.160
Is there a toy store here?

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.090
Yeah, there is.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.800
Okay, hold on.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.300
Oh, where are you going?

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.340
The toy store.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.360
It's outside the port!

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.680
Got it!

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.760
Have a safe trip!

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.410
So this is a JoyStation...

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.530
This brings back memories.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.140
I used to play with these all the time.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.410
There were a bunch of hidden
gems for this console.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.610
Then is this memory card
one of those hidden gems?

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.290
I don't see a title anywhere.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.410
You've never played any video games, have you?

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.800
That's unusual.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.920
Really?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.870
That isn't a game disc.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.290
It holds a game's memory data.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.680
So you can't use it to play.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.270
Yeah, you're supposed to
put the disc in here.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.190
But if you insert the memory card and
power it on without a game inside,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.550
you can see which games are using that memory.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.960
Oh, really...

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.200
It looks like there's only one game saved on it.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.260
It's called <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.210
Greed Island?

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.490
Anyway, there are a bunch of saves.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.710
I doubt it will do any good,
but I'll copy the data just in case.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.780
Copying <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.470
Okay.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.440
What are you doing?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.530
Searching on-line.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.250
We know the game's name.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.140
So I'm looking for a store that sells it.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.360 line:20%
0 Matches

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.460
What?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.370
Not a single match?

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.140
Does that mean it's out of print?

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.620
There aren't any used copies...

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.620
An out-of-print game would still have
some used copies floating around.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.700
It's possible that this game isn't for sale.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.880
What do you mean?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.700
It could be an indie game

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.130
that was never for sale or was
banned for some reason.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.010
Anyway, I'll keep searching.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.300
There we go.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.830
This game was sold through
legitimate channels.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.520
"<i>Greed Island</i>.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.750
A hunting game for Hunters."

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.200
For Hunters?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.280
And what's with that price tag?!

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.200
Five hundred, eighty million?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.080
It's five billion, eight hundred million!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.780
Huh?

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.460
That's ridiculous!

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.320
Only a hundred copies were produced.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.070
That isn't very many.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.760
It's practically nothing!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.060
The developers were cocky...

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.290
The number is way too low!

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.500
But it makes sense.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.020
The price is ridiculous,
but Hunters can afford it.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.800
That explains how they sold out.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.980
Do the makers have any left in stock?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.990
Yeah, I guess we could ask.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.050
The game you are inquiring about
is no longer in stock.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.930
Unfortunately, there are no plans
to print additional copies.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.740
I see, thanks.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.510
That's a no-go.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.810
I guess we'll have to find someone with
a copy and ask them to let us have it.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.300
Yeah, our best bet is to advertise
on a reverse auction website

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.330
and wait for someone to offer to sell us a copy.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.840
But where will we get the money?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.210
If we pool our money from the arena,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.110
that's eight hundred million.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.200
Then we need another five billion...

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.630
Not necessarily.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.600
Huh?

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.270
With these private deals,
the seller holds all the power.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.620
Typically, they'll ask for more
than the original price.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.720
So it'll cost even more?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.560
Maybe.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.220
Well, we can post a want ad, just in case.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.370
Yeah, but I doubt anyone will click it.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.500
"Looking for the game <i>Greed Island</i>...

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.700
Price negotiable."

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.650
Wh-What?

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.830
We already have over ten thousand hits!

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.090
So that's it...

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.650
They're trying to foist counterfeits off on us.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.020
That should have been obvious,
considering the price.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.850
This plan is a wash.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.030
We can't examine every single offer.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:07.080
Besides, we can't even tell
if it's the real game.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.040
Then what should we do?

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:14.080
If we dig more deeply on-line,
we might uncover more information.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.920
But I'm not too familiar with that stuff.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.180
Is there anyone who knows a bunch
about games and the Net?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.860
Oh, there's someone who
knows a lot about both.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.450
Huh?

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.060
He might even own a copy of <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.130
What? Really?

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.020
But I don't want to ask him...

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.440
Who is it?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.040
Oh, Gotoh?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.900
It's Killua.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.880
Gotoh-san?

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.640
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.560
Right now?

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.940
Who cares where I am?

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.660
If I tell you, my mother might find out.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.430
Anyway, put Piggy on.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.190
Piggy?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.320
What?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.050
Killua wants to talk to me?

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.110
Screw that!

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.050
Tell him I'm not here.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.440
Don't lie!

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.730
He never goes outside!

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.530
Tell him if he doesn't answer

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.560
the phone in ten seconds,
I'll break all his figures!

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.290
Fine, put him on.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.430
Hey, Kil...

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.500
If you lay a finger on my
collection, I'll kill you!

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.410
I was just kidding, Bro.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.320
You don't have to get so mad.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.170
Bro?

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.220
Well? What is it?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.210
I'm busy here.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.280
<i>Greed Island</i> ?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.740
Yeah, I've heard of it.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.340
I never expected you to ask me
about a super-rare game.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.950
You don't own a copy?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.320
No, I don't.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.370
I wanted one, but I was five
when the game went on sale.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.100
So I didn't have any money.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.940
There were over twenty thousand
requests for a hundred copies.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.990
Even though each copy cost five billion,
eight hundred million Jenny in cash.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.630
I tried looking around later,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.290
but I couldn't even find an owner.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.000
It's a legendary game for all kinds of reasons.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.680
So what's up?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.070
Are you looking for a copy?

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:22.870
Pretty much.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.740
It's impossible.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.850
Forget it.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.930
Even I had to give up.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:27.970
Oh?

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.140
You gave up because it was
beyond your ability?

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.620
That was in the past.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.230
I have a lead now.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.900
But considering the amount
of effort and money,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.650
it's not worth it.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.980
Ah, so tell me this lead you have.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.790
What? I won't tell you for free.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.660
Will you trade for a <i>Greed Island</i> memory card?

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.750
What do you mean?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.510
I happened to get my hands
on a memory card.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:07.170
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.270
Are you telling the truth?

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.520
I don't lie when I make deals.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.470
Okay, I have two leads.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.520
Hold on...

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.060
Don't say anything over the phone!

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.750
Don't worry.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.060
This information

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.760
won't help anyone who
might be eavesdropping.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.320
The first lead is...

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.870
Yeah.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.940
Yeah, I see.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.850
Okay, got it.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.280
I'll send you the memory card
through the usual method.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.920
Sorry.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.390
I ended up trading the copy
of the memory card.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.050
Sure, that's fine.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.440
It's just a copy.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.590
In return, I got two pieces
of solid information.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.860
First, there's a website for Hunters,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.180
only accessible by Hunters.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.290
We can probably find leads
on <i>Greed Island</i> there.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.270
Really?

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.720
I'll have to use my Hunter License.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.340
Stupid!

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.200
If you use your home computer,
they'll know your address!

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.340
You'll have bad guys who want your
license showing up on the island!

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.860
Oh, that's right...

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.060
You have to use public computers
for this stuff...

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.240
In a hotel or a Net café.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.330
Well, I still don't know the address.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.750
My brother promised to tell me,
once he's received the memory card.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.880
The second lead is the auction
in Yorknew City.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.960
What?

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.880
Isn't Yorknew City...

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.420
Yes, the place where we're supposed
to meet Kurapika and Leorio.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.520
In September, the city will host
the world's greatest auction.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.470
My brother said it's probably a hoax,
but there's a rumor

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.690
that someone will distribute
dozens of copies at the auction.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.530
Maybe that someone is Ging.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.690
Yeah, that theory makes the
rumor more credible.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.550
We'll need a crazy amount of
money to buy a copy.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.500
That's right...

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:12.160
I guess it really was our destiny
to go to Yorknew City.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.810
Battera, the tycoon, is offering
seventeen billion for the game,

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.560
and fifty billion for a memory card
with a complete saved game.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.210
This is truly legendary.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.210
Amusing.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.720
I'm going to end this legend...

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.190
Wow...

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.880
There's so much food!

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.970
Is something special happening?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.230
You won't be back for a while, right?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.810
Mito-san...

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.680
Who knows when your next
chance to eat will be?

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.590
Fill up now.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.160
Yeah!

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.590
Let's eat!

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.820
Mito-san!

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.750
I'm going to find Ging!

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.780
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.500
Take care of yourself until then!

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:34.310
Ging told Gon to find him,
leaving behind a riddle.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.270
In order to solve that riddle
and meet his father,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:45.740
Gon leaves his home again and heads
to Yorknew City with Killua.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:15.670
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.390
Today, we introduce Ging!

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.840
I became a Hunter to find my dad.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.830
Gon's dad,
a Double Star Hunter.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.540
He left a message
box with Mito,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.510
By the way, what does your dad want?

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.750
I'm going to find my dad and ask him!

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.940
to give Gon after he
became a Hunter.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.320
Next time: Wish x And x Promise!

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.340
Go to sleep, or you'll be late.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.090
I don't need to sleep.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.680
You should all get plenty of sleep.
