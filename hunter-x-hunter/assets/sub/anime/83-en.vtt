WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Been a while since I flipped my switch on.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.690
Scissors!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.000
Well?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.730
Look at this!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.260
I feel reborn!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.010
Inspiration x To x Evolve

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.290
The Hunters Association

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.150
has learned of the Chimera Ants
from the biological survey team,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.990
and now awaits the world leaders'
decision on how to handle them.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.200
We're counting on you.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.090
You have a single mission.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.080
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.050
There have already been many casualties.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.440
We will use any means necessary.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.590
Will that be acceptable?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.170
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.140
We simply desire

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.940
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.810
Understood.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.570
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.780
to take the blame.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.580
Th-The Chimera Ants

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.590
have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.390
Queen

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.320
There's the Queen.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.140
Royal Guard

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.160
Under her is the Royal Guard,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.100
Squadron Leaders

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.100
and then, the Squadron Leaders.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.100
Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.860
and they oversee many foot
soldiers and other grunts.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.870
A-And once the King is born,
the hierarchy shifts like so.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.350
The Royal Guard that followed the Queen

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.120
switches into the King's service.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.030
A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders
report directly to the Queen,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.260
and she focuses on directing the soldiers.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.310
The Queen remains in the castle,
periodically giving birth to Kings.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.770
The Kings travel and mate
with different organisms,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.400
so as to breed new Queens.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.270
That explains their fast reproduction rate.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.280
To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.790
you must defeat the Queen before
she can give birth to a King.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.420
But first, you need to defeat
all the soldiers guarding her.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.310
That's a tall order.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.690
Got it. We'll be waiting.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.940
The punitive force's first wave is on its way.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.550
Punitive force?

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.820
I wonder who they'll send.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.200
They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.700
They'll be strong.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.500
They'd better be!

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.330
I'm worried about Kite and the kids.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.410
They'll arrive in three days.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.850
How?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.090
Look at this!

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.350
Isn't it incredible?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.350
Why does Rammot have so much life energy?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.020
There must have been some catalyst.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.110
A catalyst...

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.200
Rock...

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.700
Paper...

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.410
Rock!

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.900
That hurts...

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.250
Damn...

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.630
What if their attacks were the catalyst?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.390
I can feel the power filling me!

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.590
Peggy...

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.020
I told you that we are capable
of anything that humans are.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.870
Including the use of this strange power?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.830
But this is...

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.660
Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.910
Wh-What are you saying?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.920
You've been ticking me off,
so I won't go easy on you.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.670
I'm assuming that's what it takes.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.440
Then I won't hold back.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.700
Come.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.240
Colt!

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.930
This is a message from Hagya.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.110
This is a message from Hagya.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.760
The ultimate prey is either
within the factory or nearby.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.460
Capture it.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.350
Capture it...

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.270
Dead or alive.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.080
Capture it!

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.460
Hagya-sama...

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.420
What is it?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.420
Do you believe they will succeed?

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.990
There are enough Captains for a decent fight.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.290
For a decent fight, huh?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.930
But I doubt they'll be much help.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.300
I'm fine with that.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.800
Why is that?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.550
They're just buying time for us to arrive.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.680
Oh, I see.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.690
Then the rare humans will be ours to take.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.710
Exactly.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.850
We're surrounded.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.100
Their numbers are great.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.010
Now, then...

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.710
Let's decide order and methodology.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:40.140
As for our targets, you have three choices.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.350
One...

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.100
Decide the order in which you will fight.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.480
Two, attempt to escape.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.400
Three, give up and let us capture you.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.570
If you choose option one,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.390
you will fight one-on-one battles with us

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.910
for a chance to survive.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.650
I don't recommend the second option.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.920
You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.090
and prolonged suffering for all of you.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.260
Option three is out of the question.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.680
That would anger us even more than option two.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.740
So, what will you do?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.550
Kite...

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.940
We couldn't have asked for a better deal.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.270
One-on-one fights with their Captains.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.490
We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.650
I'll go.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.240
No, I will.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.280
First comes rock!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.500
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.270
Okay, I'm first!

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.850
While the Ants have inherited
individualism from humans,

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.280
they've lost the unity that's
characteristic of ants.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.930
I hope we'll be able

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.390
to take advantage of that change.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.370
Well, we need to decide who
to send from our side.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.540
#6...

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.570
#6!

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.790
Who's #6?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.800
Lucky me!

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.050
Baro?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.420
How will the victor be decided?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.810
Eh? That should be obvious.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.060
Whoever dies first loses.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.610
We can't just surrender?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.800
What?!

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.940
Are you crazy?

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.110
If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.700
If you don't defeat me,
you're guaranteed to die!

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.330
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.750
But there's no need for you to die.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.660
If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.010
If you surrender, you'll live.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.340
But if you lose,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.350
you must promise never to eat another human.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.030
This guy isn't taking us seriously!

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.410
He has more pep than any human I've seen!

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.360
Lucky you, Baro-chan!

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.470
I'll kill you!

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.450
You managed to dodge that one.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.880
Then how about this?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.710
The same attack?

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.770
Gon!

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.120
He altered course.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.520
I'm fine.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.170
Why are you so tough?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.530
By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.190
Whatever...

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.230
Just need a few more times.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.540
There's no way to dodge my homing roll!

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.890
Indeed...

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.420
He only has to alter his course to
match the direction Gon dodges.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.910
What will you do, Gon?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.610
Kid, I have something to
tell you before I kill you.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.040
The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.560
or to feed them to the Queen.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.350
Then why?

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.940
Because it's fun!

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.950
I love the sound as humans
vomit their own organs

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.630
with a plop!

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.960
It's hilarious because it looks like barf.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.010
That isn't funny.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.460
I'll make you vomit your own
organs with a plop, too!

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.230
He didn't dodge...

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.330
But stopped him.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.740
Compared to Razor's spikes,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.160
this is nothing!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.650
Well, we're in a hurry.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.780
Who's my opponent?

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.940
Hey!

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.840
#3.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.970
#3's up!

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.540
You won't be smiling for long.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.290
I'm about to show you hell.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.120
Got it?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.430
I'm nothing like the trash over there.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.440
Trash?

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.930
Huh? I said trash because he's trash.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.560
I'm ten times stronger than that guy.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.060
Oh, that's nothing to brag about.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.360
What was that?!

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:08.320
When they enter battle,
their aura becomes much stronger.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.420
They're at their best in battle.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.080
Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.570
but we should have time.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.420
We'll reach the Queen before
she gives birth to the King.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.300
But why

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.380
do I have such a bad feeling?

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.220
I feel like I'm missing something.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.710
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.240
Look, Peggy!

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:58.250
I can freely control this energy!

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.420
This is incredible!

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.000
We should do more research.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.380
Eh?

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.810
If we learn the proper way
to wield this power,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.450
we can synchronize it with our natural abilities

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.890
to make it an even stronger weapon.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.080
You're too retentive...

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.440
Zazan...

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.650
She said she captured a rare
human a few days ago...

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.910
If we're lucky,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.510
he's still in the storeroom.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.110
Find and secure him.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.190
My entire body is covered by hardened skin.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.240
I can take as many of those
attacks as you can throw!

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.530
Oh, yeah?

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.970
Is there anyone ten times
stronger than this guy?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.570
This is a pleasant surprise.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.770
Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.910
Am I worried over nothing?

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.730
That's enough... It's my turn!

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.550
2!

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.450
What?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.470
Two, huh?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.300
Damn, bad spin.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.530
Killua...

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.740
That scythe is nasty.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.310
Gon, Killua...

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.190
In three seconds, jump up.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.950
Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.650
Right!

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.960
I've experienced this sensation before!

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.010
Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.490
I remember now.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.930
This is

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.310
death!

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.410
Murder via overwhelming force.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.640
Get lost.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.030
This scythe can be used
only with this technique.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.350
And it won't disappear until I've used it.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.200
It's such a drag...

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.780
So why did you choose that power?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.210
Be cautious as we advance.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.540
As I mentioned, that won't be
enough to kill them immediately.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.290
Are you okay?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.450
It's only getting worse from here.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.300
If you start to sympathize with the enemy,
you won't be able to handle what's coming.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.430
I'm fine.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.060
I have no sympathy for bugs
that call each other trash.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.360
That's a dangerous view.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.000
What would you do if one of those
bugs cared for its comrades?

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:45.670
Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward
the Chimera Ant Queen's castle

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.840
to prevent the King's birth.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.650
Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.250
I'll go.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.170
No, I will!

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.070
No, me!

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.400
Then I'll go.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.260
Go right ahead.
