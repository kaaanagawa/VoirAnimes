00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.630
Sorry about that.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.720
I carelessly let him escape.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.570
Liar.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.440
He probably begged you to grant him

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.950
one final wish, yes?

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.080
Well, I felt sorry for the guy.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.020
Given that he was dead either way.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.260
You should cease pitying enemies
who serve no purpose.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.630
I have standards.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.710
I'm not interested in people
who have no purpose.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.090
I only spare those whose deaths
would go to waste.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.100
Defeat x And x Disgrace

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.290
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.320
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.320
In the silence of the night,
something is surely about to happen...

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.600
<i>Now!</i>

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.220
Oh, it's them...

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.490
Amusing.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.050
<i>Hisoka has found his prey.</i>

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.390
<i>Leorio! Kurapika!</i>

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.240
<i>I didn't expect him to go
after Leorio and Kurapika.</i>

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.150
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.120
<i>Don't stop!</i>

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.140
<i>Stick to the plan,</i>

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.030
<i>and when Hisoka attacks his prey,</i>

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.240
<i>go for the ID tag!</i>

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.740
<i>That's my only chance to take Hisoka's tag!</i>

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.550
<i>No, I can't just ignore them.</i>

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.800
<i>If they start fighting, I'll change plans.</i>

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.310
So I've figured out who my target is,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.800
but how am I supposed to find her
on this huge island?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.650
Isn't walking around aimlessly
a waste of energy?

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.570
Constantly whining would be
an even bigger waste of energy.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.230
You already have six points,
so you're finished.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.700
But if I don't find my target...

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.340
Hey.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.130
<i>Hisoka!</i>

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.370
Imagine meeting you here...

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.300
I keep running into people
I don't want to encounter.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.790
You see,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.390
I need two more points.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.080
Could you give me your tags?

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.770
What was that?!

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.280
Screw that! I'm not gonna...

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.070
Leorio!

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.500
You said that you need
two additional points.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.520
Which implies that we
are not your targets,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.910
correct?

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.700
I'm the one who's asking
the questions here.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.910
Will you give me your tags or not?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.670
That depends.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.570
We currently have four tags.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.910
Mine, my target's, Leorio's,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.930
and a tag worth only a single point to us.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.410
Of these,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.680
only two could be the number of your target.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.940
Mine, or the tag only worth a single point.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.420
Leorio's number is #403.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.820
He was the target of #16, Tonpa.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.320
And my target was #16.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.560
Each person was assigned
a different target,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.580
so #16 and #403 are out.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.830
Indeed...

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.590
Neither of those is my target.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.840
So?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.840
That leaves the other two tags.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.580
If you're willing to take the tag worth
only one point to us and leave,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.650
you can have it.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.350
Huh?

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.350
But I will not let you have mine.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.270
And the same goes for the other two.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.060
If you insist on taking them by force,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.110
you'll have to fight me!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.040
Out of curiosity, what is your number?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.540
#404.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.780
Very well.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.480
You have a deal.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.050
I'll only take the one tag.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.500
I'll leave it here.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.890
Don't worry.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.320
I'll be standing here for a while.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.850
In only a few days,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.570
they've grown so much,
I barely recognize them.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.840
But they have much more to learn...

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.940
Why must unripe fruit

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.260
be so tantalizing?

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.020
A pity.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.100
This is the wrong tag...

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.540
<i>Whew...</i>

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.610
<i>But now I only have one more chance.</i>

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.520
<i>When Hisoka locates his next prey.</i>

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.710
<i>Wait!</i>

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.630
<i>What if the next person Hisoka finds</i>

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.640
<i>doesn't fight him either?</i>

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.550
<i>That's right!</i>

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.090
<i>If that person also hands over a tag,</i>

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.780
<i>I won't get another chance!</i>

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.640
<i>I'm so stupid!</i>

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.170
<i>I never even considered that!</i>

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.740
<i>I'm scared...</i>

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.700
<i>No more.</i>

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.700
<i>I don't want to be here!</i>

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.450
<i>I can sense his blood lust from here...</i>

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.880
Uh-oh.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.000
Those boys got me all tingly...

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.370
I must calm it.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.020
Okay.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.030
Time to go.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.180
<i>I can do this!</i>

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.280
<i>His blood lust has calmed,</i>

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.780
<i>but the look in his eyes
doesn't even compare to before.</i>

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.380
<i>I'm certain he'll attack</i>

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.290
<i>the next person he sees,
even if that person surrenders.</i>

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.410
<i>I know!</i>

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.810
<i>I should move ahead and
locate his next prey!</i>

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.210
<i>I also need to find a good spot
from which to steal his tag...</i>

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.760
<i>There!</i>

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.830
<i>At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.</i>

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.200
<i>I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...</i>

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.950
<i>Over there!</i>

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.590
<i>I've gotta hurry.</i>

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.590
<i>Hisoka will attack,</i>

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.340
<i>as soon as he notices that guy.</i>

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.880
<i>This is my chance to steal his tag...</i>

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.770
<i>My last chance!</i>

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:33.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.170
Chance

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.390
<i>Hisoka has completely
hidden his presence.</i>

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.850
<i>Oh, no! He's going to notice me!</i>

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.780
<i>I have to conceal my presence, too.</i>

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.250
<i>Completely conceal my...</i>

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.890
<i>presence.</i>

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.140
<i>Here he comes!</i>

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.140
Hisoka!

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.400
Damn... Bring it!

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.400
<i>He's going to fight back.</i>

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.460
<i>I did it...</i>

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.390
<i>I took Hisoka's tag!</i>

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.420
Approximately, seven thousand.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.920
Do you know what that
number represents?

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.430
The number of chances
I had to kill you.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.800
It's also the number of times you swung

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.440
your fishing rod when you were training.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.580
You were completely open
when you were swinging your rod.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.280
But I admit that I admired your
concentration and accuracy.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.550
That swing just now was
especially impressive.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.260
But you didn't pay attention to
your own surroundings.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.080
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.110
So long.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.500
Damn it...

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.650
You surprise me.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.280
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.660
Waiting for me to attack another?

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.840
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.460
Marvelous...

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.920
Like a wild animal.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.550
And your timing was impeccable.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.930
You concealed all traces of your attack

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.930
by timing it with my own attack.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.080
A splendid job.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.540
His poison darts completely
relax your muscles.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.690
The effects last ten days
in a normal person.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.900
Only three days are left.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.940
I'm sure you will have
recovered by then.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.020
Wait...

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:45.710
Didn't you come to take back your tag?

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.770
No, I just came to commend you.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.460
Turns out that he was my target.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.250
So I don't need that anymore.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.610
I don't need it, either.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.470
Don't say that...

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.510
You owe me one now.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.120
Feel free to pay me back when you want.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.430
Goodbye.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.810
I don't want to owe anyone...

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.740
You can have it back now.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.870
I refuse.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.870
Right now, I'm letting you live.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.380
And I'll continue to keep you alive,

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.380
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.320
I'll only take it back

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.150
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.270
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.720
Gon was completely helpless
against Hisoka,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.150
who knocked him out
with a single blow.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.730
What must he be thinking,
alone in the darkness?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.010
Next time: Trap x In The x Hole!

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.920
The end... the end...

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.050
I wanna be your friend!

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.010
F-Friend?

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.390
Y-You're so embarrassing...
