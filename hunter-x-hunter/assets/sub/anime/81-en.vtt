WEBVTT

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.670
This is a bullet casing.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.910
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.450
So the underground rulers of NGL

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.520
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.140
But judging by this...

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.250
It wasn't done by a human.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.000
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.050
The x Fight x Begins

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.310
The Chimera Ants continue their
rampage throughout NGL.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.780
And they've finally struck against the don

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.210
who ruled this country from the shadows.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.400
It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.190
have assumed control of NGL's interior.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.080
The question is if we can reach their nest

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.080
before the Queen births the King.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.080
More!

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.080
More!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.310
I need much more.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.500
I need more food of high
nutritional value for my child.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.020
Over a hundred a day?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.460
Yes, the Queen has requested

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.380
more food, to aid the King's growth.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.290
We've been providing fifty a day.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.870
Just when we'd managed

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.390
to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.390
If the Queen commands,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.390
we will double or triple our quota.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.980
We should increase our ranks...

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.720
No.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.260
Increasing them would be simple, but it
would disturb the chain of command.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.710
We must start by instilling more discipline.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.640
We'll increase our ranks afterwards.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.720
First, we must eliminate sedition in all—

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.140
Don't make me laugh!

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.670
That isn't going to be necessary.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.670
The rare human I captured has the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.830
One with the value of a thousand?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.430
What are you talking about?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.860
You didn't know?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.040
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.110
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.970
Rare?

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.970
These special humans each have the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones?

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.950
That's right.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.120
Impossible!

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.210
No such human could—

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.950
They do exist...

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.330
I saw and fought one.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.420
And then, I accidentally took a bite!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.740
Pike!

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.800
The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.790
Oh, yeah.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.140
You're right.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.990
Don't spout nonsense!

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.310
Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.680
I spoke nonsense? When?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.540
You weren't the one who
captured the rare human.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.440
I did.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.440
Remember how you praised me
for the wonderful job I did?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.920
I'm the one who disabled him!

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.450
But I'm the one who held him in place—

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.120
Enough.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.000
Make yourself scarce.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.230
F-For...

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.840
Forgive me!

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.300
Was that story true?

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.330
Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama...

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.310
Yes, there really was a rare human.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.560
Not that!

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.810
Did you really take a bite?

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.880
No, I took a bite of the normal
human, not of the rare—

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.620
It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.330
Consuming the Queen's food

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.530
is not permitted.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.540
I'll never do it again,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.880
so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.560
Hold it! Come back here!

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.550
Bihorn.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.610
Have you ever seen a rare human?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.280
No, I've only heard about them from Zazan.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.100
Zazan,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.480
could you provide more detail
about this rare human?

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.110
Sure.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.050
Arrows of light...

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.200
I understand.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.120
That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.210
Yes, that must be it.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.120
One mystery has been solved.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.030
While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.560
an officer like Pike can see them.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.130
See them and stop them.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.330
In other words, officers can capture them.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.390
Yes, like I did.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.840
That one was clearly different from
the other humans we've captured.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.400
Its whole body appeared to
be shining with life energy.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.090
That's how I knew

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.310
that it would have the nutritional
value of over a thousand humans.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.910
More than ten days' worth in one human?

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.410
If that's true, we're saved.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.330
It'd be far easier than carrying

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.420
a hundred humans around each day.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.520
If we find one on the first day,
we can rest the next nine.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.490
Fool!

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.410
They're rare because they're hard to find!

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.180
What? Again?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.540
Understood.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.090
Is something wrong?

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.630
Rammot is acting without my permission again.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.270
Damn!

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.960
Why am I stuck eating horses?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.990
Damn...

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.660
This is all Colt's fault.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.820
I want to eat humans!

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.890
First, I have to deal with Rammot.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.880
Otherwise, it sets a bad example.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.240
What is this presence?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.420
Could it be?

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.540
No one's here.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.880
Say...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.720
Something smells.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.740
Coming from over there.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.310
It's like a morning sacrifice.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.370
A ritual practiced by birds
called bull-headed shrikes.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.930
They impale their prey on sharp
objects, such as branches.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.420
Hey!

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.230
Wha?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.130
Wh-What is that?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.060
They're capable of concealing their presence?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.090
Trash.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.400
Those are mine!

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.760
Ow!

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.550
This guy is strong.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.590
Fighting him won't be easy.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.040
Gon... Killua...

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.300
You two must deal with him yourselves.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.000
That is a Chimera Ant soldier.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.180
We will encounter many more like him.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.940
I won't be able to help you during combat.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.650
If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.440
You'll just be in my way.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.530
Weren't you listening, Kite?

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.430
We are also pros!

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.490
Don't treat us like kids!

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.750
What trick is this?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.570
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.420
Time to test it!

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.470 position:80% line:20%
Thunderbolt

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.470
Thunderbolt!

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.270
First comes rock...

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.980
Rock...

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.530
Paper...

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.370
Rock!

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.320
Yes! Just enough!

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.020
Bastards!

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.050
I'm gonna eat you!

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.560
I will! Remember this!

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.780
Our attacks...

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.750
They didn't work.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.410
That guy's smart.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.040
He let his soldier do the fighting,
so he could learn our abilities.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.810
Are you coming?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:08.210
There's no need to feel down.
Your attacks weren't that bad.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.250
You just need experience now.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.030
If you wish to become stronger,
this is a perfect opportunity.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.660
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.450
Whether we win or lose,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.440
hell lies ahead of us.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.740
We're coming.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.290
Yeah.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.020
That hurts...

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.850
Damn...

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.930
Don't lay a finger on them.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.610
I'm gonna get my revenge.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.490
I'll kill them...

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.490
I'll eat them all!

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.920
I'm willing to let you kill them.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.500
But you may not eat them.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.500
Bodies brimming with so much life
energy provide the finest nutrition.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.760
They must be fed to the Queen.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.800
No way! Killing them won't be enough!

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.270
I have to tear them to shreds,
fill my belly with them...

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.770
Crap on their skulls, and crush them!

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.770
And even still...

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.980
That still may not be enough to quell my fury!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.780
I won't be satisfied with just killing them!

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.120
Don't get above yourself.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.670
This is an order.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.410
You would defy your leader's command?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.020
It isn't just Yunju's team.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.300
The other teams do it all the time.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.260
Cheetu and Hagya's teams
do whatever they want.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.550
Their leaders enjoy the hunt!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.340
Is that true?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.310
Yeah!

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.300
They chase humans, kill them,

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.310
then leave the dead bodies there.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.530
None of the other squadrons just haul
bodies back like industrious little drones,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.540
my dear leader Colt.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.670
I'll transfer to a different squad if
that's what it takes to kill them.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.630
Damn, it hurts!

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.200
A reason?

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.090
Because it's fun, of course.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.780
It's good that humans know how to speak.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.100
That way, we know what
they think as they die.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.390
I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.390
Yep, it's great!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.500
Once you've tried it, you can never go back.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.110
Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.730
You're wrong about one thing...

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.620
Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.270
We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.250
However...

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.220
You shouldn't waste the Queen's
precious food for sport.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.390
Precious food?

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.130
Don't make me laugh.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.190
There are more of them than she'll ever need.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.720
They're trash!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.860
I'm just taking out the trash.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.240
Got a problem with that?

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.050
Not at all!

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.650
Do you know about the rare humans?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.540
Rare humans?

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.680
Oh...

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.280
The ones that are overflowing with life energy?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.160
I haven't seen one yet.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.530
If you do, capture it alive and bring it back.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.460
Fine.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.680
I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.080
Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.690
I'll take that as a promise.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.510
Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.770
Let's find a rare one and eat it.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.980
Let's eat!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.330
How's Rammot doing?

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.330
Tonight will be critical.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.450
But his anger and stamina
should see him through it.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.480
Still, our army seems to have
too much personality.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.720
Having multiple perspectives helps,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.040
but too many are self-centered.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.810
We're meeting our quota, so there's
nothing to worry about.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.490
You're one to talk.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.900
Are you counting the humans you capture?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.420
Hmm... Kind of.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.500
That doesn't count.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.410
Perhaps we should have everyone
assemble to discuss this.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.890
No, we operate at different times now.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.260
Assembling everyone is impossible.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.750
I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.250
What about the Queen?

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.530
She's busy nourishing the King.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.680
We can't distract her.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.570
I'll handle this.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.590
Sounds tough.
Don't ruin your health.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.000
If you're honestly concerned,
try to control yourself.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.990
This is ugly...

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.780
The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.340
Look at this.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.350
So this is the hidden side of NGL.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.720
I suppose so.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.980
Killua... Kite...

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.590
The silence of the drug factory
overtaken by the Chimera Ants

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.200
further intensifies the chill in the air.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.370
What awaits Gon and his friends there?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.400
Next time: Kite x And x Slots.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.940
Start the slots!
