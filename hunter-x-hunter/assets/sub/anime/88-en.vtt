WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Given his personality,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.110
I doubt he'd sell me out,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.520
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.740
My chance will come after they leave.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.210
I will defeat them...

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.000
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.110
The man targeting Gon and Killua

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.470
is named Shoot McMahon.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.400
He, too, is one of Morel's students.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.490
This won't work.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.210
In our current condition,
we don't stand a chance...

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.270
Yeah.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.690
I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using
less than half of his strength.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.630
Probably so.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.430
But we have to fight him.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.470
Yeah...

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.000
I don't sense anyone else around.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.390
It's the perfect chance.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.900
When I take my target down, I am
always deliberate and thorough.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.330
That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.970
Here we go... This is my chance.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.180
What's wrong?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.190
It's the perfect opportunity.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.670
Right now, I can easily...

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.560
Go...

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.050
Go!

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.620
Shoot McMahon...

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.900
He is a coward.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.950
Hey, Killua...

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.220
Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.010
Hmm? What do you mean?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.160
Why didn't they let him go to NGL?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.480
He seems really strong to me.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.100
Well, that's true.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.710
In terms of physical ability,
he'd be a match for Kite.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.360
It's probably a mental thing.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.020
Mental?

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.550
His approach isn't in line
with this mission's objective.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.490
He's too soft.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.290
And he gets attached to animals too easily.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.750
And he did end up volunteering
to help us, somehow...

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.130
And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.110
Yeah...

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.850
<i>They can maintain their</i> Ren <i>for two hours
without having to really concentrate.</i>

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.980
That's a good sign...

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.420
If they can do it for three hours,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.690
I might consider letting them fight
Knuckle when they're fully rested.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.690
Knuckle will then be forced
to use his full strength.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.970
I hope it will be enough to teach them...

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.950
That which they lack, that which they need.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.200
But that still only takes them halfway.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.300
If everything goes well, it'll take them
about ten days to reach that point.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.130
And that means they'll have no more
than a day left before time's up...

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.120
I'm not sure they can make it.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.480
I should probably prepare for my escape...

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.160
Save my own skin.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.150
Help yourself.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.880
Thanks!

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.370
Yum!

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.640
What do you think?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.730
Oh, this is really good!

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.430
Not that!

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.120
We only have ten days.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.640
Huh?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.390
From what I've seen,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.050
you're only two-thirds through your training

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.850
to become strong enough

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.530
to force Knuckle into using his full strength...

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.430
Uh-oh...

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.530
She knows exactly what's going on.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.790
Huh? Is that true, Bisky?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.340
But it'll be fine!

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.020
We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.800
How can you be so sure?!

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.300
The situation hasn't improved at all...

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.770
You said it was all right for
me to speak up, so I will.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.690
You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.070
They didn't give you enough time...

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.240
Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.610
staring at it to calm myself.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.520
That means I'm nearly over the edge,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.290
so if you run at once, before it's too late,
I probably won't try to chase and kill you.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.640
If not for her outbursts...

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.290
This would be a pleasant meal...

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.410
We aren't gonna run away.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.790
How many times do I have to say it?

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.960
What else can you do?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.430
As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.550
We'll win!

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.310
Pinky swear.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.480
Come on... Hurry up!

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:43.190
I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle
and Shoot before the deadline.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.010
If I break my promise, I have to
swallow a thousand needles...

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.740
Pinky sworn!

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.700
On the island I'm from, there's another part.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.190
You go like this and put your thumbs together.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.580
Sealed with a kiss!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.980
Okay, now it's a promise.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.950
By the way, Palm-san,
what did you use to flavor this?

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.600
Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones...

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.010
Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.230
I suspect she's the one leading
things in that direction...

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.110
I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.290
then I let it sit for another night.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.740
Ten days left.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.150
Don't say that like a countdown to our death!

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.010
This is it...

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.900
Smoke that covers the forest like fog.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.450
Baital squad here.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.270
Goran, give me an update.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.490
Goran, do you read me?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.770
Goran!

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.470
Could they have already taken him out?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.330
Anyone from Goran's squad out there?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.350
Give me a report!

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.250
Hey...

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.900
We can't see anything with all this smoke...

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.060
We've been trying to reach Squadron
Leader Goran, but he won't respond!

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.110 line:20%
Any sign of the leader?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.970 line:20%
I can't see the guy in front
of me! What's going on?!

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.970
I've lost contact with him!

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.940
He was right beside me a moment ago!

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.650 line:20%
I can't see a thing!

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.140
He just vanished into the smoke!

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.500 line:20%
Yah! There's a hole!

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.510
With all these messages,
I can't tell what's happening...

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.430
They should've established a communication
network to operate in the leader's absence.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.010
Baital squad, forward!

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.690
Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.810
Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act
as rearguard for the Baital squad!

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.520
Proceed in a V formation!

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.810
The number of soldiers is dropping.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.030
What's happening?

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.720
Now.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.590
Hey, Baital?

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.870
So you're next?

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.770
Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.380
What do you mean?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.480
All we do is send enemies to the old man.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.440
He's the one who takes them out.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.430
This is a little too easy.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.390
But it is a surefire method.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:04.890
Can't argue there.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.650
The Chairman was being modest...

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.530
He's still much stronger than we are.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.350
And he seems rather excited about this.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.910
Oh, speak of the devil.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.780
Keep sending them my way.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.030
I'm finally starting to regain my touch.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.790
Impressive...

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.120
And how about the Queen?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.050
She hasn't made a move.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.680
The Queen is still holed up in her nest.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.680
Then the King hasn't been born yet.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.190
Continue to monitor the situation.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.030
Roger that.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.550
The old man's on a roll.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.890
Shall we grab another squadron?

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.870
Yeah.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.460
Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.330
We're down to fourteen squadrons.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.820
Damned humans.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.500
How are they managing to whittle us down?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.240
I don't know.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.310
All I know is that there are some
humans who are very strong.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.420
We know too little about humans.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.230
They appear to possess a variety
of powers far stronger than ours.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.240
Had we more time, we could
obtain that power, as well.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.080
However, once the King is born,
we will hold the advantage.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.500
Yes, I hope that will be the case.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.360
You want to come out?

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.810
Not yet.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.480
It's still too early.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.070
Okay, that's three hours!

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.710
Oh? Already?

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.890
That seemed fast.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.700
Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.840
Huh?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.450
Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.170
You can go once you're rested.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.830
Defeat him.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.590
You have a little over a day
before the Chairman's deadline.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.720
This may be your first and last chance.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:51.350
Well, if they're able to fight at full strength,
they'll have to accept the results, win or lose.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.360
If they can each identify what they're missing,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.140
then this training was a success.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.390
Now, the problem is figuring out my escape...

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.910
Seems you kids are serious tonight.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.770
Morning, Youpi.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.270
Youpi?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.030
To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.630
I'm hungry.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.040
Before we begin, I want to
know where your partner is.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.060
Eh? You mean Shoot?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.950
Yeah.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.680
Why do you want to know that?

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.180
You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.270
We need both tokens.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.450
That's a riot!

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.060
If you defeat me, I'll tell you.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.740
We might not get a chance to ask you then.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.820
You might be out cold.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.070
You're no longer amusing me...

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.600
There!

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.850
Gon!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.760
That hit hard.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.260
I could feel the impact
throughout my entire body.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.660
<i>If I drop my</i> Ken, <i>his next
punch will knock me out.</i>

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.000
After another four or five warm-up punches,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.660
I'll get serious...

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.080
Better watch yourself.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.830
I warm up fast.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.860
Still no one coming out today?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.880
No.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.510
As expected, they've holed up inside.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.890
Shall we make our move?

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.190
No, we're approaching the
deadline for your disciples.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.640
We can wait until that's over.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.910
Judging by the estimated number of
bodies currently stored in the nest,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.300
they'll need to replenish in a week or so.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.150
I would like to dispatch another

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.540
two or three squadrons at that time.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.270
Okay, I'll leave it in your hands.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.740
We don't move until we know
how our disciples performed.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.170
I think it's a waste of time...

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.380
Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.990
but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.050
We can't count on them for anything in a fight.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.190
At best, they could act as decoys.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.740
Hell, they'd probably get in our way...

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.470
I'm certain of it.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.570
That old man always was a gambler...

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.500
Want to bet whose disciples
will show up tomorrow?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.030
I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.580
If we're both wrong,
the Chairman gets the money.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.840
How about it?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.800
Sure.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.090
Then, I'll put...

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.590
...1,000,000 on them.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.700
Huh? That's just impossible!

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.540
Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.860
The Chairman is a dog?

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.360
I happen to love gambling.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.530
I always roll high...

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.370
There!

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.960
Behind you, fool!

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.950
He's still warming up?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.270
Damn, he's strong!

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.450
But why is Knuckle...

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:54.950
Could it be...

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.760
Hey, aren't you going to use
that "First comes rock" thing?

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.510
Well, you won't be able to use that technique.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.130
It's flawed, after all.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.040
It's flawed?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.260
A word of advice...

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.920
If you try that technique,
I'll stop you in your tracks.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.810
In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.270
Your technique

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.510
has two huge weaknesses!

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.670
I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.960
without sacrificing someone...

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.500
Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.630
And love and sorrow!

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.900
And reassurance...

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.260
No biggie!
