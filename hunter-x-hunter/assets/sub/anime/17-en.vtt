00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.100
Right now, I'm letting you live.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.040
Until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.550
I'll only take it back

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.440
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.850
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.450
Trap x In The x Hole

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.360
Gon was humiliated,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.340
after Hisoka recovered the tags
taken by Gerreta.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.760
As for Killua...

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.680
You're wasting your time.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.980
I'll never give you an opening to attack.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.250
<i>Tremble with fear.</i>

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.280
<i>Wear yourself out.</i>

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.100
<i>I am a very cautious man.</i>

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.530
<i>I go to any lengths necessary,</i>

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.040
<i>even when facing a child.</i>

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.170
<i>Once he exhausts himself,
and has no choice but to sleep,</i>

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.830
<i>I'll attack!</i>

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.970
I am a very cautious man.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.050
Man...

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.070
If you're not gonna show yourself,
I'll come to you.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.060
Huh?

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.560
What a pain...

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.060
You're only worth one point to me.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.190
<i>He wants to fight?</i>

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.420
<i>I can't possibly lose, right?</i>

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.950
<i>He's just a kid.</i>

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.180
<i>But...</i>

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.620
<i>Why is he so calm?</i>

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.710
<i>Is he really that strong?</i>

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.180
<i>Right... I am a very cautious man.</i>

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.710
<i>I should esca—</i>

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.760
<i>I mean, I should back off.</i>

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.130
<i>But...</i>

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.660
<i>My brothers will yell at me!</i>

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.960
<i>Actually, if I go back without
taking his tag,</i>

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.140
<i>they'll definitely yell at me!</i>

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.400
Bro!

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.520
We ran into some trouble.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.660
You're done, right?

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.940
You idiot!

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.790
You can't even beat a little kid?

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.690
Y-You got it wrong, Amo!

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.300
What do I have wrong?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.970
I-I didn't want to hurt a little kid.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.740
So I figured I'd take it while he slept.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.180
You're lying through your teeth!

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.430
F-Fine!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.530
If you insist, that leaves me no choice.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.190
Time for a beat down.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.210
<i>If I start to lose,</i>

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.450
<i>my brothers will come to my aid.</i>

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.990
Hey, kid.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.710
Just give me your tag.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.020
Do as I say, and I won't hurt you.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.210
Stupid.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.330
Aw, don't say I didn't warn you.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.520
Right in the gut.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.600
Must hurt like a bitch.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.980
Huh?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.720
What?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.460
Did you go easy on him?

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.780
You're too nice, Imori.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.610
Y-Yeah...

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.620
#198, huh?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.150
What? No way...

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.010
Since it's only a number off
from the one I'm after,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.250
maybe #199 is one of your two buddies?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.480
Umori...

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.950
Yeah.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.010
Get in formation.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.930
Time to get serious.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.270
This is no ordinary kid.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.310
<i>It doesn't matter how strong he is.</i>

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.420
<i>He stands no chance
against our teamwork.</i>

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.950
<i>We three have</i>

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.430
<i>defeated many tough opponents
with this formation.</i>

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.700
<i>Just you wait...</i>

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.180
<i>We're gonna rip you to shreds.</i>

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.950
A-Above?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.680
Don't move.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.710
My fingers are sharper than knives.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.210
Huh?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.250
You're #197?

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.780
I'm so bad at guessing these things...

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.600
Hey.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.850
Are you #199?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.970
Yeah...

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.940
Hand it over.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.790
Thanks.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.240
Now, for the tags I don't need...

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.630
And the other one goes this way.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.570
You still have three days.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.330
Good luck finding them.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.800
See ya.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.350
Damn it!

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.510
#197 was always accompanied by #199...

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.600
I didn't expect that little kid to
deal with them for me.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.260
Good thing I was watching
from the shadows.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.750
Made it easy to grab the tag I wanted...

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.530
The kid noticed I was there...

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.970
I've failed...

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.050
Man, that was boring.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.310
Wonder what Gon's doing.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:43.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.140
Too Bad

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.010
Six days have passed.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.370
Only one day left...

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.850
It's been four days since
we ran into Hisoka.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.990
And we haven't seen anyone else.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.350
Wanna head back to the starting point?

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.310
It's possible that people have
already finished.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.840
No, we won't find anyone there.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.270
This phase is unique because

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.190
you have a chance to recover
your tag if you lose it.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.860
On the other hand,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.300
you might have six points
in tags right now.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.290
But that doesn't guarantee you'll have
them when the phase ends.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.160
You can't finish it early.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.660
I see.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.460
But it's worth a shot.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.770
Only one day remains.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.800
People who already have six points

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.430
will be inclined to wait near the goal.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.970
I would do the same.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.520
Okay, let's go.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.380
Well? Anyone there?

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.500
No...

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.580
No one that can be easily spotted.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.120
Damn...

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.980
Perhaps we should split up to search,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.190
after we decide on a time and
place to reconvene.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.390
It'll go faster with three people.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.370
Gon!

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.600
I guess we all had the same idea.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.620
I've been watching from up above,
and a number of people are nearby.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.780
Really?

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.710
I see... We should search from above.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.140
That won't work.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.490
It's only possible if you have eyes
as sharp as Gon's.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.360
Gon.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.070
Huh?

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.320
Do you have the tags you need?

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.990
Yeah, I guess...

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.740
Damn, so I'm the only one
without enough points.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.900
Who's your target?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.890
#246, a woman named Ponzu.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.260
I heard that she uses chemical weapons.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.530
Gon, did you see any women
when you were up there?

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.200
Nope.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.310
I see.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.280
We can assume that there
are four possibilities.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.260
She's in good shape,
and she still has her tag.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.730
She's in good shape,
but she's lost her tag.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.750
She's out of action,
but she still has her tag.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.990
She's out of action,
and she doesn't have her tag.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.790
Is it really likely

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.680
that she'd still have her tag
if she's out of action?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.890
If she were caught in a sudden accident,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.800
or if she were defeated after
hiding the tag.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.860
If she died after concealing her tag,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.420
we won't be able to find it.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.260
Sounding grimmer by the second.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.400
Hey, do you know anything
else about Ponzu?

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.060
Does she wear a special perfume,

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.310
like Leorio with his cologne?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.610
Oh, that's right.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.360
Gon can follow her scent!

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.280
But she might not wear perfume.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.720
He can smell the chemicals she uses.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.670
She's known for using drugs, right?

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.020
Some of them must have strong scents.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.250
Well, Gon?

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.920
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.990
That's why I'm here.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.000
Is she in there, Gon?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.350
Yep, definitely.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.210
What do you want to do?

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.150
I'm going inside.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.410
You guys, wait here.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.690
<i>There don't appear to be any traps.</i>

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.440
I'll head inside.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.360
Don't enter until I give the okay.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.440
Thirty minutes.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:10.950
Huh?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.030
If we don't hear anything from you
after thirty minutes,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.170
we're coming in.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.720
Yeah.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.700
Unacceptable.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.000
If that happens, you guys
should return to the start.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.710
I can't do that.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.800
Since we've teamed up,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.140
I won't abandon you now.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.470
Then I quit the team.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.660
It's selfish, considering all the
help you've given me,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.450
but I'll do this alone.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.820
No.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.510
What did you say?!

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.610
We're staying here, no matter
what you say.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.540
Still got a problem?

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.660
Do whatever you want.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.960
Hold onto that for me.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.860
<i>I have to go for it...</i>

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.760
Isn't that...

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.110
Bourbon?

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.510
I'm guessing that

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.430
I'm your target?

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.700
Ponzu!

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.540
There's no point.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.420
We gain nothing by fighting here.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.210
I have everything to gain.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.170
It's just as you said...

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.240
You're my target!

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.780
Let's pretend that a miracle occurs,

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.530
and you defeat me.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.540
You still won't be able
to leave this cave.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.060
What?

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.920
What do you mean?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.810
He's taking too long.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.540
Is Leorio okay?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.310
Yeah.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.510
It's been nearly thirty minutes.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.320
Kurapika! Gon!

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:55.570
Don't come in!

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.580
Leorio!

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.080
Leorio!

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.300
You fools...

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.600
Why did you enter the cave?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.480
<i>He has bites all over his body!</i>

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.100
<i>If those snakes were venomous...</i>

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.000
They're vipers.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.740
Their poison isn't that strong.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.860
But he's been bitten
too many times!

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.250
S-Stop it!

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.200
If you have any cavities or
open wounds in your mouth...

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.480
No problem!

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.200
Leorio, do you have any
serums in here?

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.820
If I did,

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.680
I could have saved you guys...

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.810
Leorio!

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.240
Anyway, we have to stop the bleeding.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.140
Uh-huh!

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.720
That should do it.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.480
We need to take him to a doctor!

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.320
I would stop if I were you.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.910
You cannot leave.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.830
What do you mean?

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.950
When someone tries to exit this cave,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.920
snakes attack them.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.240
Bourbon, the snake charmer,
set this trap.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.880
If you're bitten,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.190
you'll end up paralyzed like he is.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.480
And then you'll die.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.320
Bourbon!

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.130
You're looking for tags, right?

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.950
We'll give you every tag
in our possession.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.190
So let us out of here!

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.700
It's no use.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.380
He's already dead.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.140
D-Dead?

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.810
Gon and his friends have
been caught in Bourbon

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.230
the snake charmer's trap,
and can't leave the cave.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.480
Will they pass the Hunter Exam?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.120
Will Leorio survive the
venomous snake bites?

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.900
Next time: Big x Time x Interview!

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.640
Thank you, Kurapika.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.310
Thank you, Gon.
