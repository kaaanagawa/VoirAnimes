WEBVTT

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.730
Th-Thank you very much...

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.240
Why did you not call for help?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.240
Here...

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.400
And here...

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.990
You're covered in blood!

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.640
What is this creature?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.530
What do I want

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.620
to do with her?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.090
Taking Stock x And x Taking Action

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.990
One day remains before the selection.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.730
The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610
Good morning.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.390
You boys are up early.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.120
We have nineteen hours until
midnight strikes on selection day.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.160
Tonight, we finally make our move.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.120
Let's do one final check.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.320
Once inside, Gon and I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.020
immediately head up the central stairway,
toward the throne room.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.440
Yep.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.880
Ikalgo will take

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.600
the northeast elevator down to the
basement, to search for Palm.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.320
If you find her, escape without us.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.140
Right.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.350
If the King and his three Royal Guards
are in the throne room,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.150
we proceed with the plan.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.530
The problem is, what if they're not there?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.500
You're really hung up on that...

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.390
What are the chances of that happening?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.900
Well, it's highly unlikely.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.450
But the unusual happens pretty often.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.540
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.320
We researched the enemy's behavior extensively
before deciding on a day for the attack.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.430
When you're waiting for someone to be
in a certain place, at a certain time,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.800
that's typically when the unexpected happens.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.500
In my old job, I saw this all the time.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.470
The unusual always happens
on the day you've chosen.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.050
In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.570
to ensure my success.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.100
But this time, that isn't an option.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.370
We can't wait.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.330
Once we move, there's no turning back.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.720
A moment's hesitation can mean death!

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.080
So we should take time now to decide

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.460
how we'll act in different situations.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.070
Even if they aren't in the throne room,
if they're still in the palace, it's okay.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.790
Pitou's <i>En</i> is enough to cover the palace and
its surrounding courtyards, and then some.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.100
So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.390
we'll know that they're there.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.510
From there, we just follow that
sinister aura to where it feels densest,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.470
and they'll be at its center.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.680
The question is what we do if
we don't sense Pitou's aura.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.360
In other words, what we do
if they aren't in the palace.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.450
Or if they're in the palace,
but they aren't using <i>En</i>.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.450
Would they be in the palace,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.120
but not using <i>En</i> to guard the King?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.500
That's what happened when
Knov-san infiltrated the palace!

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.510
Huh?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.390
Yes, that's what I can't make sense of.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.890
According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.070
The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.570
So if Pouf was there, the other two were
also in the palace with the King.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.220
Then, why did Pitou stop
using the puppets and <i>En</i>,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.060
leaving Pouf to handle security,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.640
which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.590
I believe the reason has to do with
how Pitou's power works...

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.600
Then we should ask Colt.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.720
Yeah.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.510
I'd guess that during that time,
Pitou was healing someone.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.800
Healing?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.060
I told you that Pitou was the
one who restored Kite, yes?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.060
Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou
used <i>En</i> during that period.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.120
Thus, healing must require a
great deal of concentration.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.320
So while healing someone,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.570
Pitou cannot use <i>En</i> or the puppets.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.320
Now it makes sense.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.870
Which means that someone,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.300
most likely the King or one of the
Royal Guard, was injured and

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.200
required healing, so the <i>En</i>
and puppets disappeared.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.710
But hold on...

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.710
Who would have been able to
injure one of those monsters?

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.110
True...

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.960
An internal dispute?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.870
Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.220
No, that's impossible.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.860
There is no chance that Pitou
would endanger the King

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.590
by removing that <i>En</i> to heal someone else!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.800
I guarantee it.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.320
Which means that the one injured...

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.130
...was the King!

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.990
I see... What you're saying makes sense.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.500
But then the bigger question
is who injured the King.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.330
The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.750
But other soldiers could never put
so much as a scratch on him.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.260
Yep, so our conclusion was...

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.240
The King injured himself?!

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.320
Under what circumstances
would that have happened?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.760
We don't know why, but it's the only explanation.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.550
I'll admit that I didn't question our
sudden stroke of luck too much...

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.610
But that chance was only possible
under abnormal circumstances.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.590
Are they starting to lose control?

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.260
That isn't good...

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.760
I'm starting to think something's
going on inside the palace.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.170
We will now begin moving to the palace.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.910
Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in
Diego Plaza at once.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.610
The citizens of the other sectors
should prepare to move out.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.980
Oh, they're starting to file out.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.630
They've begun their march...

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.840
Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.890
In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.060
five million humans will fill the palace grounds.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.520
Has the situation in Peijing changed?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.010
I thought it was only one skilled enemy,
but now there are a bunch.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.190
So there are reinforcements.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.650
They may try to use the celebration
as cover to approach us.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.800
Then the danger will be greatest
during the selection.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.630
Yes, since the King will be
participating in the selection.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.010
Our greatest concern is

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.810
the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.650
Assuming that they have a <i>Nen</i>
user capable of translocation,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.920
and that that person can use the ability
to isolate the King somewhere else...

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.090
That means at least one of us must stay

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.720
by the King's side during the selection.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.710
The King won't allow it.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.490
As it is, he's been upset by how
close we've stayed to him.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.730
Then we guard him secretly,
without his knowledge.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.780
We need someone to stay just close
enough to monitor his surroundings

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.140
while still carrying out his own role in the selection...

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.650
Whose size won't attract attention,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.000
who won't get absorbed in an amusing task...

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.760
Very well, I am the best choice for this.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.720
Strictly by process of elimination, of course...

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.320
What's wrong?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.510
Their presences have completely disappeared.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.380
I can't sense any residual aura.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.050
They must be using <i>Zetsu</i> to hide
among the marching humans.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.210
Hey.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.580
There are so many people...

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.460
Around a hundred per building.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.900
They must have been packed inside.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.470
Then if we conceal our presences,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.500
they can only assume that we're
hiding among the citizens.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.220
Maybe they'll cancel the march?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.720
No way.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.970
That would mean delaying or
even canceling the celebration.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.230
Which would imply the King had
accepted defeat and compromised.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.460
The Royal Guard won't let that happen.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.340
The celebration will begin as scheduled,
no matter the cost.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.670
Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.500
And that won't change.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.050
Once the humans began to move,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.410
my puppets could no longer tell them apart...

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.090
Should I recall them?

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.260
No, giving the enemy free
rein would be dangerous.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.570
Have the puppets join the soldiers that
are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.070
'Sup?

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.820
As expected, the puppets have joined the march.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.520
In another hour, those sectors will be deserted.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.170
There are six entrances to the
rooms that lead to the palace.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.090
We'll avoid the entrances in front of the
palace, where security will be tighter,

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.320
and wait by entrances A, B,
and C, behind the palace.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.510
Once we've entered the rooms,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.480
the only exit will lead inside the palace.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.860
What? You scared?

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.060
Don't be absurd.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.110
I merely want to be sure we're prepared.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.530
Waiting by the entrances involves
quite a lot of risk.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.350
But if we enter the rooms too early,
we won't be able to exit until midnight.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.290
True...

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.840
If we receive any useful information,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.130
we want to be free to act on it...

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.450
And we can't use cell phones near the palace,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.240
since the Ants will pick up on the signal.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.830
I think it's dangerous to spend hours
waiting inside the rooms,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.770
not knowing if there have been
accidents or changes in the situation.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.240
But you're the one who said it was
risky to wait outside the palace.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.150
Yes...

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.340
You shouldn't take their security net lightly.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.680
I'll take care of it.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.910
I'm the only one who can freely
enter and exit these rooms.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.460
If anything happens, I'll tell you.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.590
For now, you should rest here.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.300
Will you be okay?

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.270
I shouldn't have any problem
investigating the area...

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.430
Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long
as I'm out of range of Pitou's <i>En</i>...

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.190
But you should be careful.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.110
Pitou doesn't use a standard circular <i>En</i>.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.030
It changes shape like an amoeba,
giving it extended range.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.820
That's what Kite came in contact with.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.860
And it was probably deliberate...

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.710
It's a fighter's instinct to want to know
how strong the opponent is.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:36.850
And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.240
In some areas, that <i>En</i> can
stretch two kilometers.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.600
Make sure you stay out of range.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.890
Don't worry about it.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.930
In this room, I'm the one who most fears them.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.350
I won't do anything crazy.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.150
I promise you that.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.380
We will now head to the palace.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.950
Any person who leaves their line
will be shot on the spot.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.450
Move out!

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.420
Pitou...

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.300
You knew that Komugi was being attacked?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.480
Yes, I was monitoring the area with <i>En</i>.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.560
However,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.570
I determined that there was no threat
to Your Majesty, so I ignored it.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.440
From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.780
and deal with any threats at once.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.200
Yes, as you command.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.720
Tens of thousands of people are marching

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.390
in a line toward the King.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.370
Like ants... No, lemmings.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.910
A march of death.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.230
It will be dark soon.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.180
I can tell Morel and the
others to come out...

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.550
What is

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.010
that?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.220
Wing scales?

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:42.630
The wind is carrying the scales of
his wings toward the citizens...

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.170
That means...

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.300
As I thought...

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.780
They all look completely vacant and dazed.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.630
Those scales have a hypnotic effect.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.690
Stay in line as you advance!

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.740
Stay in line!

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.810
Once you reach your position, wait for orders.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.370
Do not move!

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.370
Simple orders delivered repeatedly,
while tanks roll in the background

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.030
can easily seep into a mind exhausted
from hours of marching...

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.380
It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.150
Once the selection begins,
and blood starts to fly,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.470
they will continue to quietly stand in place.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.710
Until it's their turn.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.230
Hypnosis? I see...

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.180
If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.110
But this works out for us.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.070
Eh?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.330
If we make a lot of noise,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.600
we won't have to worry about citizens panicking.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.620
Ah!

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.830
There won't be any stampede of humans
falling over each other to escape.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.880
That's a big boon.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:13.360
Assuming that over half of the people
will be in place at midnight,

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.790
we would have expected a stampede to
leave tens of thousands of casualties.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.520
Our biggest concern has been addressed.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.270
We can go crazy.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.900
Six hours to go.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.450
Everyone's here.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.830
Have you heard from Palm?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.150
No.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.950
Oh...

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.900
We'll keep waiting until half
an hour before go time.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.960
If we knew what's inside before
going in, it'd be very different...

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.070
Yeah.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.000
They both look composed.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.780
Killua, in particular, shows

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.220
none of the mental weakness he
displayed when we fought.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.320
I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.830
But for some reason,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.470
he seems on the verge of fading away.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.770
No, I don't have time to worry about others.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.870
I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.760
The fate of humanity rests on me...

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.380
Colt is a good guy...

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.880
Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.390
It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants.
Everyone has a heart.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.900
That's what I want to believe.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.890
Hopefully, the King also has one.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.520
But some of them must be killed...

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.760
If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.490
Kite, it's almost time.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.530
I promise to turn you back...

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.320
By defeating that Ant.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.090
He's fired up...

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.040
I'll focus on providing support.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.290
So no one can interfere in your battle...

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.510
Using my new Kanmuru technique.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.500
My body feels heavy.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.720
I'm suffering from days without rest...

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.180
On a scale of 1 to 100, my current
condition would be 40...

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.890
No, 35...

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.330
But I can't be whining now.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.480
With Knov out, I'm the only one left.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.990
I was hoping to fight at full strength,

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.810
but it's easier to accept my fate this way.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.750
I'll focus on playing the decoy and
drawing my target from the King.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.390
I'm sorry, Morel and everyone...

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.750
But I can't bring myself to go.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.850
I'll take a look outside.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.030
So two minutes is the longest
I can hold my breath...

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.240
Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit
will probably be, at most, half that.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.270
Good enough...

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.990
One minute is more than enough time!

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.300
Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.750
A few days ago, I couldn't have
dreamed of such a life.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.750
Thank you, Killua.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.480
I promise to carry out my mission for you!

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.300
Tomorrow will be my birthday!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.280
I am the King.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.370
But who am I?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.840
Why was I brought into this world?

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.430
Time's up... Let's go!

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220
Palm...

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.870
Ten minutes remain until
they enter the palace.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.140
Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.180
It's so cold, Gon...

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.970
They said Admiral Winter is coming!

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.260
I think you mean General Winter.
