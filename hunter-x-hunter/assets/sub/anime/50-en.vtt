WEBVTT

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.490
Play dumb.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.140
That's right...

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.250
He likes Gon, so he'll bail us out.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.880
Idiot!

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.360
Oh... Oops.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.530
What is it?

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.250
You know someone here?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.760
Ah! No...

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.090
It's that girl!

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.640
Oh? You know them, Shizuku?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.210
Nope, never seen them before.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.890
Huh?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.510
Oh, I remember...

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.650
It's the arm wrestling kid.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.490
Who was that?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.550
Two days ago, you lost to
that kid at arm wrestling.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.530
Lost? I lost?

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.230
That's a lie.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.780
I would never lose to a kid.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.760
Well, you were using your right hand...

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.040
Why? I'm left-handed.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.540
Don't bother.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.360
Once Shizuku's forgotten something,
she'll never remember.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.280
Never mind... I was mistaken.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.170
Thought so.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.690
Oh?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.900
You actually beat Shizuku?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.800
Yeah.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.930
Never would've imagined she
was a Troupe member.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.270
Okay, I'll challenge you.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.060
Ally x And x Sword

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.270
One more time.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.280
Ready...

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.530
Go.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.380
One more time.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.380
Ready...

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.950
Go.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.060
Hey...

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.720
When it comes to arm wrestling,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.860
what's my rank among the spiders?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.860
Seventh or eighth?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.900
You're not weak, but you're
not strong, either.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.120
And the strongest was this guy called Uvogin.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.910
But apparently, he was
killed by the chain user.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.150
We already said we don't know who that is!

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.050
Kid!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.250
If you speak without permission again,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.550
I'll kill you.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.610
One more time.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.060
Ready...

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.820
Go.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.580
He was an Enhancer.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.530
Simple-minded and straightforward,
he loved a good, all-out fight.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.310
But he was fussy about time.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.410
He'd get into fights

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.120
with Franklin and me when we were late.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.290
He'd beat the crap out of me
in an unarmed brawl...

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.550
I've known him since before
the Troupe was founded.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.290
I know him better than anyone.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.010
He would never...

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.490
Uvo would never lose in a fight!

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.950
He must've been caught in some dirty trap!

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.060
I will make his killer pay.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.180
I'll find him, no matter
how many I have to kill.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.250
The chain user bears a
strong grudge against us.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.980
The Mafia's Nostrade Family
hired him recently.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.010
A grudge against the Troupe?

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.990
Recently hired...

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.030
You might not know him directly,
but you may have heard stories of him!

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.270
Think hard...

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.340
If you have any guesses, spill them!

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.100
I don't know anything.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.340
But even if I did, I would never tell you!

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.950
I thought you were a bunch
of heartless monsters,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.400
but you'll mourn the death
of one of your own?

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.810
Why couldn't you spare...

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.230
Spare a fraction of that grief...

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.190
for the people you've killed?!

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.210
You're getting too cocky.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.170
Gon!

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.930
Another step, and I'll cut you up.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.260
Answer the question.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.680
Do you know who the chain user is?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.940
I already said I have nothing to tell you!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.360
Feitan...

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.970
Stop.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.820
Stop what?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.820
Stop what you're about to do.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.540
You know what I'm about to do?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.830
You're going to break his arm, right?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.170
I'd start with a finger...

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.830
Peel off a nail.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.990
Doesn't matter where you'd start.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.210
Just stop!

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.520
Why are you giving me orders?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.420
I have no reason to listen to you.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.980
Hey, quit it, Nobunaga.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.680
Have you forgotten the rules?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.900
Troupe members aren't allowed
to start serious fights.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.370
I know!

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.570
If there's a dispute, we flip a coin.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.220
Tails.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.830
Heads!

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.510
It's heads.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.840
Let him go.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.580
So, what do we do with them?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.800
They haven't told us anything
about the chain user yet.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.090
If they don't know anything,
we can let them go.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.930
Well, Pakunoda?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.940
I checked on the trip here.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.320
They really don't know anything.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.400
You're sure?

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.320
Yes.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.570
They have no memories of the chain user.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.860
Seems your instinct was off this time.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.580
That's odd...

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.150
Well, if Pakunoda says so, it must be true.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.930
Hey, Gon!

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.180
Did they do anything to you
on the way over here?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.890
No, they just asked me a few questions.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.220
Thought so...

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.200
Then they learned what they wanted
without our realizing.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.110
What was it? And how?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.610
Sounds like they really trust
Pakunoda's judgment.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.260
She must possess a skill more
convincing than mere instinct.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.520
They have no memories of the chain user.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.870
Memories?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.520
How about you?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.500
Any guesses?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.180
The power to scan someone's memory!

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.740
By touching them?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.290
That would explain everything.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.720
And we're in trouble.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.750
When she scanned us before, I had
no idea who the chain user was.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.270
But now, I have an image in my head.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.270
If she checks again...

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.900
If they have nothing to do
with the chain user,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.780
we can let them go?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.280
Yeah, there's no point
in keeping them here.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.340
No, we can't be sure they're
completely unrelated.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.490
It's possible they're being used.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.750
If the chain user typically conceals his chains,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.250
they wouldn't realize he was the chain user.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.760
We shouldn't release them until they
tell us who they're working for.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.970
Assuming they're working for someone else,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.010
it wouldn't be the chain user.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.260
Because he operates alone.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.320
Then you agree with Nobunaga.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.690
Rather than use a couple of kids,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.520
we can find the information we need
through the Nostrade Family.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.630
Since we know the chain user's a member.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.280
That's true.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.300
Our target is the chain user.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.080
We should ignore everyone else.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.050
There you go.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.040
You kids are lucky.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.290
No, not yet.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.790
I won't let him leave.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.420
Kid...

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.690
Join the spiders.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.300
Team up with me.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.860
No way.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.810
I'd rather die than join you guys!

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.880
He really hates us...

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.810
You're an Enhancer, right?

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.060
What if I am?!

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.380
I knew it!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.130
Hey!

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.080
We're keeping them here
until the boss gets back.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.630
I'm going to recommend we recruit them.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.040
Are you serious?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.330
The boss will never agree to that.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.100
Well, it's your call.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.090
But you have to watch them.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.250
You can't blame us if they escape.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.190
He reminds you of Uvo?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.170
Yeah, he wears his emotions on his sleeve.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.060
And when he's angry,
he forgets about consequences.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.050
Most of all,

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.570
he's strongest when fighting
for someone else.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.960
He did like to fight alone.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.360
But he was strongest

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.830
when he'd team up with
Nobunaga to fight a horde.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.280
Uvo never admitted it,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.930
but he preferred having
someone to protect.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.890
Then, he was stronger with
someone holding him back.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.090
Well, I guess you could say that.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.130
Shizuku is always so uncharitable...

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.940
On the other hand, Nobunaga's
skills are superior for duels.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.850
You could even say that they're
really only effective one-on-one.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.590
Whenever they had assignments to fight
together, they always complained.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.820
But in truth, they seemed to enjoy it.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.360
Okay,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.680
that's enough reminiscing.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.110
Let's get down to business.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.970
Here's a list of Nostrade Family members

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.620
taken from the Hunter website.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.680
These five are particularly important.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.560
They serve as bodyguards for
the daughter of the boss.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.630
And they're the ones who captured Uvo.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.450
But Uvo said that the chain
user wasn't on this list.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.120
Since we don't know the
chain user's appearance,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.880
we'll have to find someone who does.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.580
Oh, that's the guy I killed.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.890
Cross out the top left guy.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.330
Move around in pairs,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.370
and search for the people on that list.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.410
Then we'll meet back here
at 10 PM. That's all.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.650
Wait.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.060
Nobunaga's staying here, right?

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.030
What should I do?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.530
You can team up with whoever's left.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.170
Ow...

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.720
I was a fool.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.100
If I'd made a move,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.120
Hisoka wouldn't have hesitated to kill me.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.310
That murderous aura...

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640
I was frozen in place.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.500
If Gon had suffered a lethal blow,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.670
would I have been able to move?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.570
That's impossible.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.320
Your only concern when you meet someone
is whether you should kill them.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.580
You're wrong...

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.490
"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.380
I drilled that into you...

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.710
You're wrong!

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.340
Scary...

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.130
You look like you want to kill me.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.220
Let me warn you first.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.730
Step into range, and I'll cut you down.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.230
Killua!

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.550
I stand no chance against him.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.270
I have to think of a way to escape...

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.800
No windows.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.240
One exit.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.780
How can we get him to move away?

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.280
Is Leorio okay?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.930
I hope he was able to find Zepile-san.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.920
Killua, are you okay?

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.920
Yeah.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.690
Hey,

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.340
Zepile-san taught us welding, exposing...

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.860
What else was there?

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.430
I forgot.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.260
Side-stomping, maybe?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.510
I don't think that was it...

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.160
Gon...

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.570
I'll act as a decoy.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.690
Use that chance to escape.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.200
What are you talking about?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.730
Seriously.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.330
Forget it.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.610
You're smart enough to know
how much stronger I am.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.830
There won't be any chances.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.330
I already know that!

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.060
This room only has one exit
and nowhere to hide.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.570
He can see everything we're doing.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.090
We're facing someone who can watch
us without creating an opening.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.990
He's probably an iaido master.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.570
With his shodachi, his range
is at least two times mine.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.350
If I take one step too close,
he'll strike a fatal blow.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.740
But that's the point!

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.190
You can't do it.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.420
Shut up!

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.820
I won't know until I try!

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.330
Killua, what are you thinking?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.080
I'll stop his shodachi, even if it kills me.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.140
Use that chance to run away!

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.590
Huh?

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.640
What was that for?!

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.320
Don't be so selfish!

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.170
Don't talk about dying like it's nothing!

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.250
What?!

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.350
You did the same thing earlier!

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.600
I'm allowed to do it!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.480
But you aren't!

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:39.980
Huh?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.860
You can't use logic against an Enhancer...

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.330
We can't escape unless we're
prepared to die, stupid!

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.860
You have no idea what I was thinking...

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.120
Who's the selfish one?!

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.490
Yes, I've no idea...
Because I'm stupid!

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.120
You kids are hilarious!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.520
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.310
Just behave yourselves.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.260
I know you're serious.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.270
Don't throw your lives away.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.710
Wait until the boss gets back.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.760
If he won't give his approval, you can leave.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.330
But if you try to escape, I'll kill you.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.990
Don't make me draw my sword.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.650
If I pull it out, you'll die...

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.240
I remember now!

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.360
It was side-stepping!

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.160
Welding, exposing...

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.660
And the last one was side-stepping!

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.350
Do you remember now?

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.540
Yeah, I sure do!

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.850
See?

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.550
How could we forget something so simple?

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:48.610
Huh?

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.000
Now that we've figured that out...

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.550
Let's go!

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.090
Are you serious?

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.310
You're going to die.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.200
I'm not skilled or merciful enough

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.380
to control my strength.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.810
Fools!

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.740
If the exit is blocked...

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.150
Make your own!

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.260
The wall...

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.450
Tsk, which one do I chase?

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.660
We're on the fifth floor.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.630
The kid with slanted eyes
is already close to the stairs.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.380
So the black-haired kid!

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.010
Now he has nowhere to run.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.390
Am I an idiot?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.760
They can break through walls to escape!

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.500
The slanted-eyed kid is below.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.770
I'll have to follow the black-haired one.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.770
Where is he?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.420
The walls are intact...

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.400
So is the door.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.280
Killua, are you there?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.780
Yeah, I'm here!

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.820
That's it!

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.320
That last hole was a decoy!

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.320
He broke it before hiding in the nearby room,

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.780
waiting for me to pass,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.800
before stepping into the hallway.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.800
We can beat him together!

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.060
<i>His presence disappeared...</i> Zetsu?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.560
Does the idiot want to fight me?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.980
<i>An advanced application of</i> Ten <i>and</i> Ren.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.270
En!

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.070
En

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.780
Normally, you shroud your body in aura

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.760
that extends a few
millimeters from your body.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.830
<i>But with</i> En<i>, you extend that
aura as far as necessary.</i>

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.590
<i>You can sense anyone who
steps inside your</i> En.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.530
Inside it, you can even count
the leaves as they fall.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.710
You can conceal your presence and approach,

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.150
never making a sound.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.220
<i>But step within my </i>En,
<i>and I'll swing my sword.</i>

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.220
Come to me.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.220
Stupid.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.680
Man, I wanted to beat him up.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.320
That was impossible.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.230
He'd have fought you off and killed you.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.190
One hundred percent guaranteed?

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.980
We don't have a chance

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.020
only knowing the basics of <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.320
What is it?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.250
You finally sound like yourself again.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.820
It's my job to say crazy stuff.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.720
Your job is to stay cool and stop me.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.390
So I'm counting on you!

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.750
You're so selfish.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.020
Well? What do we do next?

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.260
That depends on what you want to do.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.020
I want to defeat those guys.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.640
Well, that matches our original objective.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.640
But we'll have to improve our <i>Nen</i> to do that.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.960
<i>Nen</i> has the potential to give us the power

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.610
we'd need to stand a chance.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.150
And the fastest way to learn more
would be to ask Kurapika.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.100
Huh? Why?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.390
Because Kurapika is the chain user
who defeated one of them.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.290
Huh?

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.300
You didn't realize it?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.170
Is that really true?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.170
I'm pretty confident.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.920
If it's true, we have a chance.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.170
Because we learned <i>Nen</i> around
the same time Kurapika did.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.410
We need to learn the techniques

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.050
appropriate to our abilities.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.310
And most importantly,

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.680
we need the strength to fight the Troupe.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.930
And Kurapika is the key to
finding those answers?

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.610
Yeah.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.210
At the same time, a new storm brews

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.280
at the heart of Yorknew City.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.320
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:16.250
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.610
Today, we introduce Franklin,

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.700
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.640
a member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.010
He's an Emitter.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.370
An Emitter.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.690
His attack Double Machine Gun fires <i>Nen</i> bullets.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:16.250
Transforms hands into
machine guns that fire
<i>Nen</i> bullets.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.310
Retool your fingers for an extra punch!

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.790
Next time: A x Brutal x Battlefield.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.750
Out.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.500
Out?

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.720
Outfield!

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720
Infield!
