WEBVTT

00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.090
Damn... Almost.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.780
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.250
What's going on?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.130
He wasn't aiming for me...

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.290
He was aiming for the woman.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.700
He was trying to kill her!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Magic x Of x Despair

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.290
He's back.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400
The King has returned.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.430
Hey, aren't we too close?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.250
It's okay...

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.680
We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.440
The problem will be when
the King and Pouf split up.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.440
Should I remove APR from Pouf,
and use it on the King?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.420
These are known as human grapes.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.360
The humans fit to become
soldiers wait here to hatch.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.540
Hurry!

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.060
Hurry!

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.590
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.930
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.810
There it is.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.240
Hide it fast.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.360
Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.980
Faster! Faster!

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.990
Faster! Faster!

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.430
Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.180
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.880
Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.200
We must also hurry!

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.260
Where is Welfin?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.110
These won't work.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.370
When the bodies are ripped apart,
I can't use Living Dead Dolls.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.850
Killua...

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.020
The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.790
Yeah.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.310
We should circle around, following the wall,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.250
and hide in the crowd.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.200
Okay.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.030
What about Gon and Pitou?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.000
They just entered the Peijing hiding place.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.000
They're walking down a hallway.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.860
How does that crystal work now?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.240
You can also see Pouf and me in it?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.560
Yes, looking from a bit above.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.620
Wink Blue uses my crystal ball

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.860
to remember people seen through my right eye.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.120
Looking through only my left eye,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.700
I can watch those people's current
positions in the crystal ball.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.550
At the moment, the crystal ball
is simultaneously showing

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.510
Gon and Pitou, Killua and me,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.010
as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.430
It's like watching a TV screen
that's been split up.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.030
However, my right eye has only
seen Pouf, you, and Gon.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.470
So I can only see the others when
they're around one of you.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.720
And I can only use my power to
watch three people at once.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.940
If I see someone else with my right eye,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.230
I won't be able to see the oldest
of the three targets, Pouf.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.960
I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.610
If you can only see his main body,
and his clones are scattered,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.560
it's probably more a minus than a plus.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.740
Is that so?

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.630
If I can only see his main body,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.370
that also means I won't be fooled by clones.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.630
And if his main body is only the size
of a fly, I can literally crush him.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.530
Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.850
What greater plus is there?

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.390
So they figured me out.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.120
Then I just need to use that against them.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.690
Walk forward.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.370
It's the right door, at the end.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.950
Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.950
Pitou's hearing was sharp
enough to pick up the voice

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.080
on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.370
Pitou-sama, this is Welfin.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.220
I will keep this as brief as I can.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.470
Brovada and I have retaken the girl.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.070
Intruders are still around,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.430
so we're taking refuge beneath the palace.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.410
I will let you hear her voice.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.400
Hello? Pitou-sama?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.250
This is Komugi.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.880
I'm fine, so don't worry.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.360
Got it...

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.050
Goodbye.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.780
Was that good?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.780
Yes.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.690
If possible,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.290
can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.210
It's him, right?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.590
Since I can split myself at the cellular level,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.820
I can also become different people.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.590
I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.850
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.530
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.240
So, keep watching Gon and Pitou.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.150
You should see something interesting soon...

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.270
Now, heal Kite, like you promised.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.150
Once that's done, I'll release her.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.280
Your name...

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.470
What is your name?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.830
Gon.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.310
Gon Freecss.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.560
Gon...

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.190
You listened to my request.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.430
So I will be honest with you.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.560
He is

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.410
already

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.810
dead.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.920
Dead?

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.920
He died during our fight.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.920
I remember now.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.590
Back then, you were...

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.480
I was unable to revive one who was dead.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.700
My power could only prevent

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.730
the body from decomposing,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.710
and control its movements.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.820
His soul is no longer here.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.980
There is no way to heal him.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.590
I am sorry.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.200
Palm...

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.040
Yes?

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.280
Thank you.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.980
What? What's this?

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.760
What are you thanking me for?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.740
Stuff...

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.040
Stuff? Such as?

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.050
Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.680
What was that?

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.430
It seems wrong to make me mad
while you're thanking me!

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.640
Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.640
Because now we're friends.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.120
I never say thanks to my friends.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.790
Anyway, how's Gon?

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.020
Y-Yes, that's right...

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.480
What's wrong?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.710
It can't be...

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.960
What's going on?!

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.020
Kite...

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.600
Kite is...

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.430
dead.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.890
Man, forced to take another life...

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.280
You've grown, Gon.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.380
If I...

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.610
If I...

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.640
Whether we win or lose,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.560
hell lies ahead of us.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.380
If I hadn't gone with him...

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.870
Kite wouldn't have died.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.870
It was...

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.420
It was my fault.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.700
It was because I tagged along...

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.360
It was really my fault...

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.180
Get away from me!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.340
It's my fault that Kite is...

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.070
No... It isn't my fault!

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.600
Pitou's the one who killed him!

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.030
Not me!

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.430
But it was me...

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.500
It was me....

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.660
I killed Kite.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.560
It's my fault...

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.600
No! It's Pitou's fault!

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.430
But it's really my fault.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.520
Kite is alive!

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.900
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.640
Kite is dead...

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.900
Kite is dead.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.300
Kite is dead.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.630
Kite is dead...

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.420
Kite is dead!

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.250
Help...

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.530
Someone help...

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.940
Kite is... Kite is...

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.930
Kite is... Kite is...

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.750
Kite...

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.490
Just wait a little longer.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.760
I'll get you back to normal soon.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.660
I can't get him back to normal.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.560
Kite is gone...

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.030
It's my fault.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.020
Someone help...

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.170
Someone help Kite—

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.210
No! No! No! No! No!

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.210
But... But...

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.210
But...

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.720
But... But... But... But...

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.720
But...

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.620
Doctor Blythe.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.250
What?

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.260
Pitou's going to help Kite?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.640
Oh, it's true...

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.780
Kite being dead was a lie.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.680
Pitou will heal him.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.260
Huh?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.470
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.270
Turn Kite back to normal.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.140
Please...

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.230
After you finish what you're doing.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.700
Why? What's going on?!

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.960
What's wrong? What happened, Palm?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.530
I don't know...

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.310
I can only see what's happening...

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.960
But something is wrong with Gon!

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.670
What's wrong?!

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.960
Pitou is healing itself, not Kite.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.300
Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.580
Impossible...

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.480
As long as she's in our hands, Pitou...

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.960
Pitou has to obey us!

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.320
Please...

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.950
Help Kite.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.670
Next time: Anger x And x Light.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.220
Hold on until I get there!

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.510
I don't care if this is the end...

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.760
I'll kill you, Pitou!

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.610
Gon!
