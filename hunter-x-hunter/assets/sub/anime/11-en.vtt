WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330
Then, I'll let go of him.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.560
Whoa! Wait!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
I'm awake! I'm awake...

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.180
Don't let me go!

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.570
However, you're down to twenty hours.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.070
But now we have a 2-1 lead.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.070
Now...

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.750
It's your turn!

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.160
What do you want to bet on?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.170
Trouble x With The x Gamble

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.630
In the five-on-five battle
with the prisoners,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.630
Gon and his friends lead 2-1.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.890
They're one win away from victory.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
The fourth round is a series of wagers,
with time as the stakes.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.600
What will they bet on next?

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.600
Well, are you going to tell me
what the next bet will be?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.700
Or have you lost your nerve because
I've figured out your scheme?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.070
Very well.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.710
Leroute
112-year sentence, illegal gambling
and endangered species trafficking

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.160
H-Huh?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.710
She's really cute...

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.830
That old guy's probably
dancing on the inside.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.970
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.600
Then let's bet on whether
I'm a man or a woman.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.060
Huh?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.310
What's wrong?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.150
Is there a problem?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.560
N-No.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.060
<i>She's obviously a woman...</i>

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.480
<i>Or could she be a tranny?</i>

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.350
<i>No, she's gotta be a woman.</i>

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.230
That's fine,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.330
but how will you prove if I'm wrong?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.250
Oh, right...

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.140
I'll let you examine every part of my body.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.210
Until you're fully satisfied.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.610
Seriously?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.800
Her body?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.440
Leorio will bet she's a man.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.460
Uh-huh.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.310
Huh? Why?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.120
Okay, I've decided.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.310
I bet ten hours that you're a man!

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.750
I knew it.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.730
Dirty old man...

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.820
Huh? But how did you know?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.950
<i>This way, even if I'm wrong,
and it turns out she's female,</i>

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.200
<i>I'll still get to examine her body!</i>

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.580
<i>It's a win-win situation.</i>

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.110
<i>Actually, please be wrong...</i>

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.230
There you have it.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.710
I get it now.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.970
Okay! Reveal the answer!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.220
Too bad... I'm a woman.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.230
R-Really?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.730
Would you like to check?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.590
B-B-But of course!

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.250
<i>A mistake I do not regret.</i>

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.620
Just watching hurts...

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.250
He's gonna lose.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.340
Huh?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.010
The opponent has seen through
Leorio's strategy.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.350
He's been betting conservatively,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.010
to minimize damage from either outcome.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.020
A gambler who focuses on avoiding
a loss won't ever win.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.520
I guess Leorio just doesn't
have what it takes.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.900
<i>As expected.</i>

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.780
<i>His approach to gambling
doesn't frighten me at all.</i>

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.910
<i>He'll never beat me that way.</i>

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.520
Now it's your turn to think of a gamble.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.100
What do you want to bet on?

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.750
<i>This is no time to celebrate.</i>

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.430
<i>I only have ten hours left...</i>

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.670
Leorio has no more room for error.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.380
If he loses the next wager,
the overall score will be 2-2.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.940
And we will have fifty fewer hours
to escape this tower.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.690
Leorio...

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.280
I can't lose the next bet,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.060
but I can't think of anything
that'd be a surefire win...

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.030
Oh, that's it!

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.280
We can bet on whether I'm
a man or a woman.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.460
No, that wouldn't work...

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.570
Hey, old man...

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.390
You're thinking aloud.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.590
I know.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.950
Leorio!

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.110
Huh?

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.490
How about whether or not
you're still in your teens?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.020
Come on, Gon!

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.560
I don't look that old...

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.690
I'm clearly a teenager!

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.230
T-Teenager?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.610
But he looks like an old man.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.610
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.610
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.620
Sure.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.430
Rock-paper-scissors?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.950
Why did he have to pick
such a difficult wager?

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.760
Huh?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.120
Rock-paper-scissors is hard?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.130
<i>I happen to be quite confident in
my rock-paper-scissors skill.</i>

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.510
<i>Just recently, I won a gourmet vacation
in a tournament in the shopping district.</i>

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.280
Let's see, then.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.270
I'll put eighty hours on my victory.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.140
E-Eighty hours?

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.310
Is something wrong?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.400
I'm free to bet as much as I want.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.400
W-Well, that's true.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.400
And if you lose, I can still only
take ten from you.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.410
Don't worry.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.750
<i>She doesn't need to bet eighty.</i>

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.410
<i>Ten would suffice.</i>

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.620
<i>What if she loses?</i>

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.390
<i>Or is she that confident?</i>

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.210
<i>As anticipated, he's starting to stress.</i>

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.930
<i>He's so easy to read.</i>

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.510
While rock-paper-scissors has simple rules,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.930
the game itself is quite complex.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.840
If you consider the game
from a probability standpoint,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.110
there's only a one-third chance of losing.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.980
However, if your opponent can predict
your reasoning and control your reactions,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.450
defeat becomes much more likely.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.400
In other words, simple-minded Leorio

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.060
will be at a disadvantage.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.710
I see.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.520
All right! I've made my decision.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.360
What?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.160
It's obvious what you'll use.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.970
I can read minds.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.740
Liar!

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.240
Your bluffing won't scare me!

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.980
You'll believe me soon enough.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.990
<i>As planned, he's losing his
cool over a blatant lie.</i>

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.000
<i>She can read minds?</i>

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.310
<i>She's lying. She must be lying...</i>

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.990
<i>But what if she's telling the truth?</i>

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.030
Leorio will use rock.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.620
Huh?

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.620
Let's do this!

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.790
Rock...

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.790
Paper...

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.590
Scissors!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.820
You were right.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.360
Good guess.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.290
Nervous people unconsciously avoid

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.390
any action that involves opening up.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.390
In other words, by making
Leorio uncomfortable, she ensures

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.830
that he's less likely to use paper.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.690
So if she sticks with rock,

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.900
she's guaranteed a win or draw.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.620
As I was explaining, rock-paper-scissors
is actually a mind game.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.410
Now I see.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.380
Hold on.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.760
Since we both used rock, wasn't that a draw?

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.230
What of it?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.420
A-ha!

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.860
So you were lying about being
able to read my mind!

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.550
If you really could, you'd have won.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.510
Right?

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.450
What's so funny?

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.180
I deliberately gave you that tie.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.530
Quit lying!

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.290
Did you forget?

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.420
We're trying to stall you here.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.900
If I chose to, I could force an
indefinite series of draws...

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.660
But that wouldn't be any fun.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.660
So I'll end this with the next turn.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.010
Well? What will you use next?

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.100
Think hard.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.030
Come on.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.670
Damn!

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.500
<i>That's it.</i>

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.670
<i>Worry. Fret.</i>

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.000
Worrying. Fretting.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.040
When someone loses confidence,
they crave reassurance.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.050
That makes him more likely to
either use the same hand,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.890
or, in an effort to regain his confidence,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.520
to use a stronger one than
in the previous round.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.440
Meaning

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.200
that she wants Leorio to choose
either rock or paper.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.550
Yes.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.680
If she uses paper, she's certain not to lose.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.950
Then Leorio just needs to stay a step ahead!

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.460
Well, if he could calm down,
that might work.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.110
Leorio!

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.460
What is it?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.470
Hey, you'll win if you go with scissors next!

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.880
What? Scissors?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.470
Go ahead and try.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.350
<i>Then she'll just use rock.</i>

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.480
<i>No, she'll go a step further
and choose paper.</i>

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.180
<i>Wait, then she'll take another
step and use scissors...</i>

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.990
<i>No, no, then she'll take
another step and use rock...</i>

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.990
Man, I have no idea what to think!

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.240
Here we go!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.240
Here...

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.990
comes the...

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.240
draw!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.960
I win!

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.850
Rock-paper-scissors really is complicated.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.760
Now the score is 2-2.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:30.140
Worse yet, we have to give up
the fifty hours he lost.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.570
Sorry. I was pretty confident in my
rock-paper-scissors ability.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.510
Pretty pathetic showing, then.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.550
What was that?!

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.030
Well, I can't argue with you on this one.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.800
Say, how much time do
they have left now?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.980
Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.800
Which means

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.810
they actually have fewer
than ten hours left.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.060
It doesn't matter how much time they have.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.800
Because my opponent will die.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:37.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.170
Rock-Paper-Scissors

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.780
It's finally time for the last round.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.400
Guess I'm off.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.520
What? Killua?

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.930
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.850
Damn it! I really needed
to win my round...

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.760
Gon... This guy is totally pissing me off!

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.810
Now, now.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.560
Don't give up before we even know
what the contest is.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.310
Well, if it's something like
mental math, I'm surrendering.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.440
That's right!

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.330
Depending on the opponent,
we still have a chance!

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.830
That little kid is their last member.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.750
Never thought I'd see him
fall prey to that monster.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.330
Poor thing. He's still so young.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.500
I didn't want to use him.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.390
However, the Hunter Exam has no mercy.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.380
If he dies here, that's fate.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.860
I'm removing his handcuffs.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.040
You guys are getting too scared...

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.120
Idiot, stop!

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.260
Is he really that terrifying?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.370
Isn't it all just ancient history?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.760
That guy...

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.010
You know him?

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.850
We should take the loss.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.840
Killua!

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.240
Don't fight him.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.290
Why not?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.540
Johness the Dissector.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.780
Johness
968-year sentence, mass murder

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.270
The worst mass murderer in Zaban's history.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.380
He chose his victims randomly.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.760
It was a famous case...

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.310
146 people, young and old, men and women,
met with brutal deaths by his hand.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.500
The victims had one thing in common.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.820
He murdered all of them
with his bare hands.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.820
He was known for his iron grip,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.790
the power in his fingers.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.660
It's been so long since
I touched human flesh.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.400
You don't have to face that psychotic killer...

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.760
There's always next year.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.890
Hey, Killua...

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.530
Killua!

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.870
Damn it, was he even listening to me?!

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.500
We should let him go.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.250
He could have a plan.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.760
How are we settling this contest?

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.080
Contest?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.990
I believe you're confused.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.830
This will be a one-sided massacre.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.500
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.950
I just want to hear you scream.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.120
Really? Okay.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.010
Then the loser is the one who dies.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.860
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.550
I'll tear your body apart.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.640
Wh-What?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.920
I'm so cold.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.760
That's...

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.990
mine.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.990
G-Give it back.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.460
Okay. That's three wins, two losses.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.740
We pass, right?

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.680
Yeah, you win.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.060
By the way, you must be
itching for some action,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.270
since you didn't get to do anything.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.810
Want to play with me?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.310
I'll abstain.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.070
Oh, okay.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.410
Who is he?

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.410
That's right. You guys don't know.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.830
Huh? Don't know what?

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.830
Killua comes from an elite family of assassins.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.330
Eh? A-An elite family of assassins?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.280
I'm back.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.550
What?

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.580
Uh... Well,

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.030
good work!

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.850
Across the bridge,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.940
you'll find a small room.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.110
You must spend the fifty hours
you gambled away there.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.750
Well, let's go.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.500
Yeah!

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.770
R-Right...

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.030
Gittarackur, applicant #301,
is the second to pass.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.950
Total time, twelve hours
and two minutes.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.320
I figured you'd already
crossed the finish line.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.010
All right!

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.400
Hanzo, applicant #294, is the third to pass.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.170
I'm the first to finish!

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.750
Huh?

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.170
Total time, twelve hours
and three minutes.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.170
No!

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.780
I don't believe this...

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.410
I came in third.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.100
Good grief.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.370
We have to spend fifty hours
in this room?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.670
Killua.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.520
Huh?

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.510
Can you tell me how that
technique works?

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.930
Technique?

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.050
The one you used to instantly
remove his heart.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.760
Oh, that wasn't even a technique.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.240
I just ripped it out.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.140
Ripped it out?

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.810
But to make it easier,

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.820
I manipulated my body a bit.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.790
Y-Your nails...

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.240
Wow!

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.490
Mass murderers are still only amateurs.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.180
I used to be a professional.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.540
But my old man would've done better.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.040
When he removes a heart, you won't
see even a drop of blood.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.000
How reassuring.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.750
<i>As long as he's on our side...</i>

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.010
Well, then.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.290
We have more than two whole days.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.470
What should we do, Killua?

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.900
First, we should search the room

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.670
for any kind of entertainment.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.520
Yeah!

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.020
Man, you kids don't have
a care in the world.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.250
Gon's team of five has passed the trial,
with three wins and two losses.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.290
However, they must spend the fifty-hour
penalty in this small room.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.760
They're running out of time.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.380
Next time: Last x Test Of x Resolve!

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.440
Think like a fish!

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.500
You can do that?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.560
Yep!
