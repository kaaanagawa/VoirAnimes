00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.040
In the Dentora region

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.380
of the Republic of Padokea,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.300
Kukuroo Mountain.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.520
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.010
Lamentation Tours

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.930
Well, how long will you be here?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.680
Until we meet Killua!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.350
We won't leave before then!

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.230
Then please come this way.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
The x Guard's x Duty

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.010
Gon and his friends have confronted

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.330
the obstacles that they must overcome

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.500
in order to meet with Killua.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.430
What awaits them at their destination?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.460
Here are the servants' quarters.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.030
It's getting late.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.760
So you can stay here tonight.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.300
Please come in.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.420
Hey, I'm back!

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.070
Oh, you rarely bring guests.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.820
This is Seaquant.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.620
He works with me here.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.150
Good evening.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.500
If you managed to win over Zebro,
you must be special.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.660
Well, make yourselves at home.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.670
Though it won't be easy here.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.350
You want to see young Killua?

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.720
That's a riot!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.870
Sorry. But we're dead serious.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.130
Then let me give you a warning:

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.230
Give up, and go home.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.010
What was that?!

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.690
Zebro told you about the
Testing Gate, right?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.230
That should give you an idea of
what this place is like.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.570
We understand that it won't be easy.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.540
But I'm not leaving.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.580
Not until I see Killua!

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.090
When Killua was in trouble,
I wasn't there for him.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.400
If I had been there,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.910
I could have stopped Killua!

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.650
Killua is my close friend!

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.500
We understand.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.160
Then why not do some training here?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.490
Training?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.640
Hey, Zebro...

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.790
Listen to me, Gon-kun.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.840
You three are allowed to work together

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.540
to open the door.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.800
With a little training, it should be possible.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.050
How about it?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.900
I don't like the idea of being tested...

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.930
But if there is no other way...

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.730
We'll just have to do it!

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.150
Yep!

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.960
Then I'll need you to put these on.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.160
How is this so heavy...

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.480
It weighs fifty kilograms.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.600
Please wear it at all times,
except while you sleep.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.620
I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.870
Please have some tea.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.170
What the...?

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.370
The cups weigh twenty kilograms.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.420
This teapot weighs forty kilograms.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.380
All furniture and utensils in this house

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.860
weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.040
I see... So this will serve as training.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.440
It's useless.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.780
They'll give up in two or three days.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.760
What was that?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.290
Seaquant, I believe that
your shift has already started.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.100
Oh, that's right...

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.110
Sorry about that.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.200
He isn't a bad person.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.520
By the way, where's the bathroom?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.590
Through the door over there.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.220
I'm guessing that

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.090
the door is also...

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.350
Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.100
Five hundred?

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.470
What?! Get out!

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.000
I can't hold it in!

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.640
Kalluto-chan, open the door.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.530
Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.000
It's no use, Mama.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.150
He isn't even the least bit sorry.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.660
We need to make him suffer more.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.570
Milluki! Shut your mouth!

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.540
Kil, stop being so stubborn
and say that you're sorry.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.620
Oh, right. That friend of yours...

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.170
Gon, was it?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.420
He'd be better off just leaving,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.510
but it sounds like he wants
to try the Testing Gate.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.930
Gon is here...

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.630
Milluki! You're talking too much!

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.700
Listen to me, Kil...

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.460
You didn't even tell me?!

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.600
Don't yell at Mama!

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.360
I told you to shut your mouth!

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.920
I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil...

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.230
Since it's impossible for him
to open the front gate.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.160
He'll do it.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.740
What?

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.750
Gon will open it.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.120
Oh, that's nice.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.940
But he'll still never make it here...

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.010
Gon will...

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.340
He'll do it.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.520
He will definitely make it here.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.150
Wait, Gon!

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.920
You just watch.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.840
Huh? Why?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.430
You need to let your arm heal first.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.660
As long as Kurapika and I can open it,
it doesn't matter.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.120
Let us handle this!

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.170
Okay.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.060
Let's do this, Kurapika!

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.150
Yeah!

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.550
It's impossible...

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.580
No use... It won't budge an inch.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.060
Damn!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.620
But we just started our training.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.470
If we work hard enough, we can do it!

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.070
I wish I could share your optimism.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.160
This will never work.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.880
You kids need to wake up.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.870
In that case,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.680
you should quit watching us
and do your job!

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.590
Gon is one of us.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.600
And he wishes to see his friend.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.100
It's only right that we should help him.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.470
Okay, let's give it another shot!

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.610
Yeah!

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.370
Man, you can't just mindlessly push.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.080
Match your timing.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.380
You have to push both doors,
with all your strength, simultaneously.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.790
Or the gate won't ever open.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.900
Match our timing...

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.900
And push both doors with all our
strength simultaneously...

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.340
Okay!

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.900
One!

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.900
Two!

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.900
Three!

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.540
Leorio! Kurapika!

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.290
It moved.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:49.150
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.150
Testing Gate

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.830
What?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.110
The Testing Gate?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.280
And?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.680
Oh, well...

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.280
I just wanted to let you know.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.790
Very well.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.170
He's always so cold.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.440
Hey, why don't you try removing
those vests today?

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.200
Oh? Music to my ears!

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.380
Yeah!

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.760
Without them, we can
definitely open the gate now.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.500
Let's do this, Kurapika!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.280
Yeah!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.210
One... Two...

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.210
Three!

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.450
Damn it...

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.110
It won't move any farther.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.730
One last spurt, Leorio...

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.490
Got it!

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.320
Gon...

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.350
Why are you using your left arm?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.250
It's okay.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.750
My arm's healed now.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.370
Healed?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.890
Are you sure, Gon?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.010
Yep!

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.890
Anyway, we have to push together, right?

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.680
Right, let's push!

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.020
Here we go!

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.020
One!

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.020
Two!

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.270
Three!

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.540
It's opening...

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.610
Ow...

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.130
It opened.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.900
Yes!

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.710
We did it, Gon!

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.760
Uh-huh!

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.980
Follow the path, and head for the mountain.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.770
The mansion should be somewhere up there.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.110
I'm ashamed to admit

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.810
that even though I've worked
here for twenty years,

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.630
I've never been up the mountain.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.900
Sorry that I couldn't be any help.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.660
No, that isn't true.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.300
You've both been a huge help.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.230
Thank you for everything!

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.410
Goodbye!

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.170
Those kids are really something.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.140
They might be able to
make it to the mansion.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.380
Won't happen. They'll just
get themselves killed.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.180
Speaking from your experience
three years ago?

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.700
We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.520
That made it painfully clear

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.200
that I wasn't on their level.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.210
So you decided to work here.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.680
Sorry...

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.870
But the masters and servants
are all monsters.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.470
Once you step into their territory...

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.560
The Testing Gate opened?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.060
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.500
This is a critical time for Killua.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.440
We cannot allow anyone near him!

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.580
Especially not those unnecessary friends...

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.680
Do you understand?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.160
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.250
Leave.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.010
You're trespassing on private property.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.320
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.970
We called ahead.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.760
And we came through the Testing Gate.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.450
The butlers did not give you
permission to enter.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.110
What do we need to do to get permission?

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.520
I said I was Killua's friend,
but they wouldn't put him on.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.210
I wouldn't know.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.070
Because no one has ever
received permission.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.110
Then we'll have to trespass!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.330
I suppose so.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.460
In any case, this is where I draw the line.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.060
If you take one step beyond this line,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.540
I'll remove you by force.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.770
Gon!

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.090
Damn it!

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.380
Leorio! Kurapika!

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.020
Don't interfere.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.270
Let me handle this.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.760
Ow...

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.960
We don't intend to fight you.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.660
We just want to see Killua.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.660
It doesn't matter what your motives are.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.660
I'm simply following my orders.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.850
You can try all you want.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.610
I'll never let you pass.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.860
I will pass...

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.240
I'm going to see Killua!

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.580
Welcome home,

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.460
Killua-sama.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.730
Yeah.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.640
I made...

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.600
a friend...

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.280
Stop it.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.150
Stay away!

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.000
Cut it out!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.740
Don't you realize how futile this is?!

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.110
Why don't you stop him?

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.710
Aren't you his friends?

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.720
What's the problem?

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.470
I'm just here to see my friend.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.470
I'm just here to see Killua!

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.160
Why do I have to do this?!

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.380
Hey.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.410
Huh?

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.990
I crossed the line.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.740
Aren't you supposed to hit me?

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.370
You're different from Mike.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.580
You may try to hide your feelings,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.130
but you have a heart.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.510
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.830
Please...

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.810
Help Killua-sama—

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.610
Honestly...

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.500
What was that servant babbling about?

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.750
She made it sound like we're
being mean to Killua.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.430
A worthless apprentice had
the nerve to insult us!

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.050
You must be Gon.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.400
I heard about you from Illumi.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.010
Killua knows that you're here.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.140
I have a message for you from Kil...

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.730
"Thank you for coming.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.870
I really appreciate it.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.120
But I can't see you right now.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.110
Sorry."

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.480
Gon and his friends have finally made it
inside the Zoldyck estate.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.320
But now, they face their
greatest obstacle yet.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.390
A sad message from Killua,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.300
saying that he can't see them.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.380
Next time: The x Zoldyck x Family!

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.770
What is Killua to you?

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.370
My big brother!
