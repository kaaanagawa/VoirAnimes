WEBVTT

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.480
What do we do, Zaikahal?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.030
Evil x and x Terrible

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240
His name is Gyro.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.040
And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.150
Gyro spent his first twelve years

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.300
in a construction camp.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.950
By the time he said his first word,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.800
he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.020
His father forced him to slave away...

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.420
until Gyro finally killed him and fled.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.330
His father, who raised Gyro
alone, was a silent man.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.010
When his father returned from work,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.580
he drank cheap liquor by himself
until he went to bed.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.740
He very rarely talked to Gyro,
who was on the upper bunk.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.320
Thus, Gyro barely knew

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.170
how to speak before the age of seven.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.280
When Gyro returned from work,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.780
he was not permitted to leave his bed,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.700
except when visiting the restroom.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.810
He was allowed to relieve himself twice
a day, and only before 9 PM.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.430
The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly
whenever he turned in his sleep.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.420
His father hated that sound.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.540
After his father once severely
beat him because of that noise,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.090
Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.720
He also learned to control his bladder at night,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.110
keeping an empty liquor bottle
for when he couldn't hold it.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.800
"Don't make trouble for others."

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.620
That was the one lesson his
silent father taught him.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
From a young age, Gyro did
his best to adhere to it,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.240
learning from his mistakes.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.040
Since his father had never
bought him even one toy,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.140
this lesson was his one and
only gift from his father.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.750
Within his small world,
his father was essentially God.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.190
And no matter how cruel his father could be,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.420
Gyro continued to idolize him,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.300
believing that his father needed him.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.160
This belief stemmed from two facts...

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.660
When Gyro was five,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.250
a terrible fever nearly killed him.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.610
All night, his father stayed up,
replacing his towels with fresh ones.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.670
And the other reason was...

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.280
that his father had never
once ordered him to leave.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.500
Gyro was proud of these two facts.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.540
"Idiot...

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.940
He hasn't kicked you out
because you bring in money!"

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.730
Though he had previously kept that
possibility locked away deep in his mind,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.790
Gyro snapped when the older youth
insensitively brought it to light.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.570
Regretting that he'd revealed his secret,
Gyro was furious with himself.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.800
His pride wounded, rage overcame
him, and he attacked the youth.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.830
The youth had always mocked the timid boy,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.520
so when the boy fought back,
he went mad with anger,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.270
to the point where not even
knocking him out would satisfy him.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.280
He stomped on the boy's face,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.280
spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.530
"When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.410
Your old man was drinking by himself as always.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.370
You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.960
But that night, the neighbor had
a fight with your old man.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.000
He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.830
Let me tell you what your old man said.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.300
It wouldn't matter.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.810
I don't care if he dies.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.480
You hear that?"

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.670
As Gyro listened to the youth,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.820
he witnessed something inconceivable.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.900
His father looked him in the eye,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.370
paid him no attention, and then left.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.180
That was when Gyro finally understood.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.410
The universe doesn't give a damn about me.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.820
My father doesn't care if I live or die.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.850
In other words, my life has no meaning.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.380
If I live, I'll bring in money.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.870
If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.880
My father told me not to
make trouble for others

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.910
so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.090
It was never a lesson to help his son.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.080
It was fully for his own benefit.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.500
In that lesson, "others" meant my father.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.400
No...

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.280
It meant "humans."

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.400
Don't make trouble for humans.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.390
I must not be human...

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.800
Eventually, the boy stood up,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.050
grabbing a nearby hammer.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.020
Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.670
Nine years after that, NGL became
a nation, with him as its king.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.020
Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:32.020
The drug D² was merely the first step.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.930
Yunju!

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.220
You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.300
I didn't feel like fighting.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.470
Either way, the food will reach the Queen.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.560
I just want to enjoy the hunt.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.560
Gyro...

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.650
Damn, I should have just eaten him!

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.200
Listen up!

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.070
I'm taking over this factory!

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.310
From today on, this is my fortress!

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.260
This is awesome!

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.040
This is bad.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.710
These creatures are too dangerous!

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.770
Look!

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.560
What...

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.180
What is happening in this place?

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.110
What? More dead soldiers found?

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.860
Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.370
Plus, one of mine is missing...

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.400
Its communication has been cut
off, and it hasn't returned.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.610
Yunju's team dealt with the
humans holding guns.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.040
Does this mean there are other
humans who are resisting us?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.580
Sounds that way...

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.890
But the dead soldiers were killed
by something that wasn't a gun.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.210
Something?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.390
What could it have been?

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.580
How would I know?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.390
Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.190
Where are the corpses?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.400
Peggy's examining them above.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.400
This one was killed by a gun.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.160
I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.910
But I'm not sure about the others.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.430
The skull was punctured.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.920
Yes, but not by a gun.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.640
And I had difficulty understanding

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.940
the soldiers' explanation of the events...

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.430
As it is, the foot soldiers' communications
are simplistic and just to the point.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.550
They said one human mimicked firing
a gun, and no projectile emerged,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.930
but something pierced the
soldier's skulls and they fell, dead.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.780
Can't some soldiers both see
and feel what's happening?

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.380
You're correct.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.200
Those soldiers said that they
felt a projectile being fired.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.650
So they possess abilities that we do not...

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.080
These humans could prove tougher
opponents than anticipated.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.840
If humans have this power, once we
inherit their genes, we also will.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.550
We only lack the trait.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840
You don't understand...

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.340
The humans' strength lies
in their ability to learn.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.840
If they learn that the Queen
is where we're vulnerable,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.750
they'll do whatever it takes to kill her.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.850
Hmm?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.570
You're the one who doesn't understand!

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.110
That just means we need to do
whatever it takes to keep her safe.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.860
Am I wrong?

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.870
No, you're correct...

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.620
That's right.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.730
I will protect her...

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.630
I will protect Reina!

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.880
Reina?

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.840
Who's Reina?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.520
Uh, you're the one who said that name!

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.390
I did?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.780
I didn't say anything.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.430
You must be hearing things.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.140
Anyway,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.960
the problem is that humans
possess multiple weapons

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.180
capable of defeating our foot soldiers.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.150
What should we do?

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.400
Use their weapons against them.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.160
Give them a taste of their own medicine.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.160
Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity
to manipulate complex weaponry.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.990
But the humans don't know that.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.600
They must be very frightened.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.170
I understand...

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.680
You're a better strategist than I am.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.100
Reina?

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.150
It didn't work...

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.650
No one received the message.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.910
That means all the other Hunters I was
in contact with have been taken out.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.690
Oh...

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:08.910
We should leave.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.410
Those creatures are too much for us to handle.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.670
We need to leave NGL and tell
the world what's happening...

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.220
So that an extermination force can be formed.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.180
Whatever... Let's just run for it!

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.430
Or we'll all be—

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.320
I-It's here!

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.250
Run!

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.930
More will be coming!

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.230
Hold on, now...

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.800
I said to capture the humans alive.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.510
We're supposed to deliver
them to the Queen fresh.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.500
A-A human face...

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.010
What is that thing?!

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.150
Fire...

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.760
Open fire!

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.770
Orange Arrow

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.020
He grabbed my Orange Arrow,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.860
fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.260
Huh? This is clearly visible.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.370
The grunts couldn't see this?

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.390
So the life energy

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.630
that surrounds your body is
what fuels this weapon?

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.130
You will make a magnificent
meal for the Queen...

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.690
Balda!

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.340
O-Oh, no!

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.960
I took a bite without thinking...

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.840
Zazan-sama will be angry again!

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.550
You bastard!

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.390
O-One moment...

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.600
My hands are full.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.270
Take this!

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.090
As always, you're a disgrace in battle.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.280
Zazan-sama...

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.450
Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.870
Oh!

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.130
You're right.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.800
We're going back.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.460
Hmm?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.960
Since we've obtained some excellent food.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.680
He probably has the nutritional value
of a thousand normal humans.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.090
Well done, Pike.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:19.850
Zazan-sama!

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.000
I am most grateful for your praise...

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.470
You honor me!

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.890
Don't forget the food.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.990
Oh, yes...

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.400
I can't save him myself...

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.720
I have to call for help!

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.350
There's still... There's still time!

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.910
Even if they take him, they
won't eat him immediately...

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.180
Please...

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.040
Find a Hunter with a strong aura!

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.940
I must hurry back to the border!

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.070
Other Hunters should be there—

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.100
So much fun...

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.560
Hunting is so much fun!

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.740
Help!!

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.750
Help!!
Chimera Ant Nest

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.750
Rocky Area

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.750
Notify the Hunter Association!!

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.710
It'll be dangerous.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.520
But could you accompany me?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.610
Of course.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.620
We're pros.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.150
Miss interpreter...

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.690
Sorry, but we're in a hurry.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.370
Yes.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.830
The horses can move a bit faster.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.520
They won't be fast enough.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.670
I want you two to return to
the border, find the others,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.670
and get word to the Association.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.620
These creatures are dangerous.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.720
Got it.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.670
Be careful, Kite.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.770
Right.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.180
If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.440
Right back at you.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.180
All ready to go!

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.730
Let's go.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.100
This is a bullet casing.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.860
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.770
So the underground rulers of NGL

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.260
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.810
But judging by this...

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.370
It wasn't done by a human.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.800
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.630
If the Chimera Ants are using guns...

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.790
I hate to consider the possibility,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.500
but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.170
have already been fed to the queen...

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.060
What will happen if Chimera Ants
are born with their genes?

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.490
NGL and Chimera Ants...

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.920
The worst combination imaginable.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.170
This could create an unprecedented biohazard.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.840
The situation has taken a sudden
turn for the absolute worst.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.260
Next time: The x Fight x Begins.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.620
Ready...

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.510
Set...

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.550
Gon!
