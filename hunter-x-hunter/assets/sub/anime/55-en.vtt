WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
Did you sell him out?

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.860
Sell out Uvo?!

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.900
I'll take that as a yes...

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.370
Outta my way!

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.750
Hold on...

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.310
Let's hear his explanation.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.380
Explanation?

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.530
What is there to explain?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.180
Calm down.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.630
Didn't the boss tell us that prophecies can
be avoided, depending on our actions?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.280
Hisoka, explain what happened this week.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.190
I cannot.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.260
What?!

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.140
All I can say is that the first verse was true...

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.570
Nothing more.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.630
You hear that?!

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.290
Move!

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720
Just hold on.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.770
Hisoka, why can't you explain?

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.590
If I were to tell you the reason,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.340
I would be telling you
precisely what I cannot say.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.780
Thus, I cannot say.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.790
It isn't that I won't.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.790
I cannot.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.780
That's all I can let you know.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540
If you cannot accept my answer,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540
then in order to defend myself...

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.040
I'll have no choice but to fight.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.050
Allies x And x Lies

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610
After seeing Hisoka's fortune,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.520
Nobunaga suspects Hisoka of betraying them,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.010
and draws his sword.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.500
Forget it.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940
You're impossible to deal with.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.720
As if, you fool!

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.110
What?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.620
Nobunaga,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.620
stop talking for a bit.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.930
Huh?

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.020
Did the boss do that?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.970
Probably.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.630
Hisoka, I have a few questions for you.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.630
If you're unable to answer, just say so.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.890
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.080
In the fortune, what are
the calendar's secrets?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.890
The powers of the Troupe's members.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.150
Of how many members?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.830
Seven.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.490
No, eight.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.880
The boss and Uvogin,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.540
Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.990
Pakunoda, Shalnark, and I add up to eight.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.880
So until yesterday, you didn't
know of Kortopi's ability?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.910
That is correct.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.810
What is our opponent's power?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.780
I cannot say.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.180
What about his appearance?

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.260
I cannot say.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.020
What is your relationship to him?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.370
I cannot say.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.800
I understand.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.970
The red-eyed customer, the chain user,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.860
has two abilities at the very least.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.460
One would be the ability he
used to capture Uvogin.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.570
The other would be the ability that
prevents Hisoka from speaking.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.870
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.020
Since the fortune uses the
phrase "sword of law,"

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.700
the latter must be able to compel
you to follow set rules.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.250
"Do not lie to me."

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.260
"Do not give out any information about me."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.840
Something like that.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.570
I would also assume

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.720
that he placed something inside Hisoka's body.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:56.980
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.640
The first half of the verse mentions a trade,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.650
but the second half only describes
what the customer took.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.980
This suggests that the sword
of law would attack Hisoka.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.540
In other words, he traded the
sword's attack for our secrets.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.990
Oh, so lovely...

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.620
The sword that can restrict Hisoka's
speech is powerful indeed.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.380
You are magnificent...

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.880
I absolutely must be the one to kill you.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.130
Let's review.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.580
We're up against the chain user.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.380
He's either a Manipulator who used
real chains to defeat Uvo,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.140
or a Conjurer who used <i>Nen</i>
chains to defeat him.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.130
Is there a difference?

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.350
A big difference.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.600
A Conjurer could walk around unarmed.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400
That's a huge advantage.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.790
I see.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.610
Conjurers have to exercise their imaginations,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.910
but it's easy to conjure
something you're familiar with.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.910
The problem is the power
that's restricting Hisoka.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.690
Since it's the sword of law, it must
involve rules he has to follow.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.340
Yes, it's very likely that two are the
commands the boss mentioned.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.050
Also, he's probably barred from
attacking the chain user.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.760
And I'd imagine that he'll die
if he breaks those rules.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.860
How amusing.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.140
There is no sword of law in my body...

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.690
That fortune was my own creation.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.690
I only revealed the powers of two members.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.190
Not eight.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.060
It was a risky gamble that would have turned

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.580
the entire Troupe against me,
if the boss hadn't figured that out.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.210
All to keep the spiders in Yorknew City,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.220
to allow me to fight the boss.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.450
Should we leave Yorknew City,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.970
it's hard to say when I'll see the boss again.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.220
What about Hisoka's second verse?

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.160
"The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.410
losing five more legs.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.860
Do not leave your temporary shelter,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.440
for you are one of the remaining legs."

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.700
If he leaves our temporary shelter, this base,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.120
then Hisoka will die.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.300
What does the homesick part mean?

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.250
It refers to our desire to go home.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.270
If we return home, half of us will die.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.370
I get it.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.430
Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda, Shalnark.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.540
One more for half the members...

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.140
No one else's fortune predicted their death?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.410
Then it has to be Feitan, Kortopi, or me.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.640
We didn't get our fortunes told
because we lacked the data.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.160
I am staying here.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.650
There's something I wish to do before I die.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.650
I will not be leaving our temporary shelter.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.530
Boss, what should we do?

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.280
Leave or stay?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880
Stay.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.300
No.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.070
Huh? Why not?

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.430
You were the one who wanted to
capture the Phantom Troupe.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.180
It'd be pointless now.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.330
But why?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.070
With the reward gone, you'd be
taking a big risk for nothing.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.440
Yeah, but capturing the Phantom
Troupe would be worth it!

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.680
You're getting your priorities mixed up.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.850
Have you forgotten why we're here?

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.730
<i>Greed Island</i>.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.830
Exactly!

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.810
The Southern Piece auction begins in two days.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.460
We need to build up our war chest!

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.020
Actually, I have a great plan
to get the game.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.840
What's your plan?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.340
It's a secret right now!

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.000
Stop being coy, and spit it out...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.100
You're strangling me!

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.850
I'm going to die!

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.080
Anyway, I'll work something
out for the game.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.350
So for now, let's stick to the Troupe.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.600
Do you really have a plan?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.400
Yep, but it's not guaranteed to work.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.740
How likely is it to work?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.730
Huh?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.180
What percentage do you think
your plan has of working?

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.990
Seventy percent.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.290
Seventy?

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.290
M-Maybe more like sixty...

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.250
So it's a fifty-fifty deal.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.850
That sounds much better than trying

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.870
to earn six billion in two days.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.690
Okay, have it your way.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.340
I'll let you handle the game.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.640
But we can't deal with the Troupe alone.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.300
We only move if Kurapika helps us.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.330
Okay.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.650
Boss, where are you going?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.240
Shopping.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.150
I told you earlier.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.310
Basho and I will accompany you.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.910
Can you watch over things here, Squala?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.270
Sure.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.410
I'm saved!

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.290
Guard the Scarlet Eyes well.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.700
Yeah.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.020
With these guys helping, I should be fine.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.920
I'm off, then.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.260
Yeah, see you later.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.570
How did it go?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.690
I couldn't get a straight answer.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.850
The community didn't have any updates
regarding the auction today.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.330
You should tell them that
the Troupe is still alive!

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.910
Then the Mafia might rethink it.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.450
No, nothing will change.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.310
The community values its
relationship with Meteor City.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.230
It's safe to assume that they will
not attack the Troupe further.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.730
Really?

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.030
But that wasn't the information I wanted.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.840
My only concern is whether the
auction will proceed as scheduled...

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.850
You're not planning to intercept them, are you?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.530
That's crazy...

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.240
How can you confront them
without Mafia support?!

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.870
You have it wrong, Leorio.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.360
I never had any help from the Mafia.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.740
Kurapika, let us help.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.650
We're willing to do anything.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.490
Turn him down...

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.430
The reward was rescinded.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.500
I know.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.290
I want to stop the Phantom Troupe.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.080
That hasn't changed.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.000
Turn him down...

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.720
Turn him down!

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.260
You'd be risking your lives.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.330
Come on, that's what he wants to hear.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.680
Okay, let's put together a plan.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.440
Uh-huh.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.820
He agreed?!

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.910
First, we'll need someone to watch their base,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.110
and to provide updates.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.280
I can do that.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.900
The target is the woman named Pakunoda.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.390
You can ignore everyone else.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.120
Okay.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.120
Be very careful.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.620
Don't worry, I won't push my luck.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.830
I'll need a driver to accompany me.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.150
Leorio, could you handle that?

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.780
Huh?

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.880
Y-Yeah...

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.590
It'll be fine.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.530
You'll be safe if you're with Kurapika.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.760
Hey, Killua...

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.260
Don't make it sound like I
was scared or something!

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.410
Kurapika, what about me?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.280
I need you to act as a decoy,
to throw the enemy off.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.020
Got it.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.470
Hold on!

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.540
Isn't that a dangerous role?

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.290
He'll have to face the Troupe members again!

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.420
That depends on our strategy.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.530
Strategy?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.780
What strategy will we use?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.810
A very simple one.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.310
While the enemy is occupied with Gon,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.790
I'll capture Pakunoda and escape by car.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.450
That sounds a little shaky...

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.250
There are too many uncertainties

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.790
for me to devise a concrete plan.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.100
I'll let Gon decide his strategy.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.370
But I'll need you to draw their attention
for at least half a second...

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.290
A full second if at all possible.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.940
One second, then?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.550
Yeah.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.510
Draw their attention away for one second.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.230
Can I do that?

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.060
Gon.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.100
You are the key.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.820
Can you handle it?

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.550
I'm not sure.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.220
I'll need to think about it.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.820
We have six hours.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.820
If the auction proceeds as scheduled,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.330
the spiders will make their move before then.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.580
Hey,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.500
why are you accepting our help now?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.300
Because the risk I'm taking has increased.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.090
I have to eliminate Pakunoda immediately.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.230
No matter the cost.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.350
He's...

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.010
So this is why Kurapika seems so different...

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.350
His resolve is even stronger.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.850
Kurapika,

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.110
put a <i>Nen</i> blade in me!

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.080
A <i>Nen</i> blade?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.500
Gon, weren't you listening?

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.450
Kurapika will die if he attacks anyone
who isn't a Troupe member!

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.570
Keep your voice down!

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.370
Then why is there a <i>Nen</i>
blade in Kurapika's chest?

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.740
Kurapika isn't a member of the Troupe.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.260
What I'm about to tell you
will increase my risk further.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.260
Okay.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.020
Hey, Killua...

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.660
I'll start with the conclusion.
It is indeed possible.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.660
The five chains have different abilities.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.420
Two of the chains are for attacking spiders.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.170
The first is Chain Jail.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.090
The binded target is
forced into a state of <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.640
This power is for capturing the spiders.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.640
And this is my Judgment Chain.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.190
I point a blade at the target's heart,
then state rules that they must follow.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.820
If a rule is broken, the target dies.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.530
As you've figured out,
I pointed a blade at my own heart.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.780
At first, I devised the rule that I would die if I attacked anyone besides a spider

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.040
with my chains, and I set a
blade pointed at myself.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.340
But that was when I realized something.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.570
Would using them on myself be
considered a violation of that rule?

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.170
It was possible I would be an exception,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.170
but I didn't know for sure.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.440
That's why I adjusted the rule.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.780
I can only use Chain Jail against the spiders.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.070
Meaning that I can use my Judgment
Chain on those who aren't spiders.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.510
But first, a condition must be met.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.450
A condition?

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.460
This chain can only be used
when my eyes are scarlet.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.210
You can make your eyes scarlet now?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.140
I had to work at it.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.920
It took a while before I could
deliberately turn them scarlet.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.340
I mastered the power in my middle finger
by vowing to never release this chain,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.170
and to always risk death.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.190
The power in my pinky was
resolved by my unique nature.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.160
When my eyes are scarlet,
I become a Specialist.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.760
And I can use any ability I've
learned at full strength.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.250
I'm not sure what that means,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.790
but you should be able to use
your <i>Nen</i> blade on me, right?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.710
Yes.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.090
Go ahead.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.710
You can choose the rule to set.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.970
I accept your resolve.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.220
Can you make three of those blades?

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.470
You can rescind the rule once
our mission is over, right?

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.330
Killua! Leorio!

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.160
We had a little talk.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.270
And since we're working together...

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.860
We should share the same fate.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.500
What do you say?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.260
The answer to both questions is yes.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.870
But you three are wholly mistaken.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.750
I never had any intention of
using my blade on you guys.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.620
Then why endanger yourself
by telling us your secret?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.130
Gon, I wanted...

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.680
No, I wanted to thank all
of you for your resolve.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.850
Even if one of you ends up revealing my secret,

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.840
I will have no regrets.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.710
I have good friends...

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.870
That's not fair, Kurapika.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.160
You're actually putting more
pressure on us this way.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.170
That was my goal.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.410
Oh, I get it now!

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.810
That isn't remotely funny!

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:34.680
Well,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.240
I'll head out, then.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.040
Can't waste any time.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.060
Be careful, Killua!

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.800
Yeah, I got this.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.140
You will find eternal rest

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.500
in a room filled with black merchandise.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.400
Beware solitude above all.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.780
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.500
On a dark day with very little light,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.040
you will face two choices within a small room.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.370
You must choose between pride and betrayal.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.290
While the death-bringer hovers near.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.890
Do not make any phone calls.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.980
When it matters most, you will
be unable to reach anyone.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.860
It would be unwise to answer the phone,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.610
for the death-bringer will come
calling one time in three.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.120
Let's break into groups.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.510
We'll spend the next week
operating in these groups.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.120
Avoid moving alone.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.870
Shizuku, Pakunoda, and Machi.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.750
Kortopi, Phinks, and Feitan.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.010
Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.260
Bonolenov, Franklin, and Hisoka will stay here.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.640
Boss, can I ask a question?

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.080
Some kids know about this place.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.770
Kids?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.590
Well, they didn't have anything
to do with the chain user.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.620
But I'm still worried.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.710
Yeah! I forgot!

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.530
Boss, I want to recruit that kid.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.400
Wait, that wasn't why I mentioned them!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.040
Explain.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.040
I see... He does sound interesting.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.680
However, it doesn't sound
like he'll join the spiders.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.420
We can convince him!

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.910
Just meet with him.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.050
Boss, don't listen to him.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.550
So, Machi, why the concern?

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.480
Um...

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.680
It's just a hunch.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.350
Instinct, huh?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.480
You have sharp instincts.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.770
It's possible that there's something
important about those kids.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.690
To be safe, we need more fake bases.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.070
Kortopi, can you make ten more?

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.380
I can do another fifty.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.080
And the instant anyone enters
a fake base, I'll know.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.330
My copies function as <i>En</i>.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.290
Something isn't right...

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:23.840
Am I in the wrong place?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.180
No, that's impossible.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.530
It can't be!

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.100
There are more buildings now!

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.460
As rain comes pouring down,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.440
the operation to capture
Pakunoda commences.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:15.210
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.260
Today, we introduce Feitan.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.660
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.450
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.620
He enjoys torturing people?

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.280
A Transmuter.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.860
He's a nasty fellow!

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.830
A negative, cruel person who
enjoys torturing others.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.120
And he's interested in <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.920
Don't try to talk like he does.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.800
Next time: Beloved x And x Beleaguered.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.710
Shepherd.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.420
Bow!

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.220
Maltese.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.910
Bow!

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.730
Pomeranian.
