WEBVTT

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.730
We will now resume the match.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.240
Razor's Nen beasts...

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.740
Are vanishing.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.700
He drew the aura he'd
dispersed back into himself.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
So his next throw will use his true strength.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.050
Bargain x And x Deal

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.890
The match begins once again.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.310
What is Gon's plan to retake the ball from Razor?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.030
I didn't expect I'd need to use this...

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.280
It's been a long time

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.320
since I've felt this good!

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.020
He threw the ball straight up?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.070
Does that mean...

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.990
He's going for a spike?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.180
Hey, over there.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.040
They're literally going to...

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.940
Combine!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.090
I see what you're attempting.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.800
Then it's a contest to determine

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.760
the winner!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.730
Their plan is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.730
for Gon to catch the ball.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.730
For Hisoka to smother it...

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.740
And for Killua to provide support!

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.410
They did it!

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.150
They stopped it!

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.300
Way to go!

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.810
I have to applaud them for that.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.800
They overcame my power using their wits.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.060
And the key to their success

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.440
was that boy Killua.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.840
Gon focused aura on his
hands to catch the ball.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.870
The incredible concentration and focus
it took to pull that off deserve my praise.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.430
The moment Gon caught it,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.110
Hisoka used his power to smother the ball's
momentum so Gon wouldn't drop it.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.880
Had his technique been less than perfect,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.560
the ball would have flown off.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.970
And Killua...

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.520
He was stuck between them,
acting as both a cushion and a brace,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.910
balancing his aura between
offensive and defensive.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.360
If the aura around his body had been too weak,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.010
he would have failed to work as a cushion,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.240
and all three of them would have taken
major damage from the ball's impact.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.870
But if he hadn't used enough aura on his legs,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.900
he would have failed to act as a
brace, and the ball would have

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.000
knocked all three of them outside the court.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.740
He needed to analyze how to balance

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.080
his aura between body and legs
within one-percent accuracy.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.840
A feat that demanded both experience and talent.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.280
But Killua managed to compensate for
his inexperience with his prodigious talent,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.420
allowing him to overcome such a difficult task.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.770
His talent is scary.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.550
I didn't reach that point until
I was in my late twenties...

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.240
I have to beat them before they can combine.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.230
Right after their attack, my chance will come.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.710
If I can get them at that moment,
they won't have time to combine.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.960
Certainly, Gon's throw is powerful,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.550
but now I have the power to catch
it without being pushed back.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.100
Then I can pick them off one at a time.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.430
I need more power...

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.840
More...

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.480
More!

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.370
He didn't use his full strength earlier?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.380
Unbelievable...

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.950
He's a monster.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.390
Ging, you should be happy.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.000
This kid is definitely your son.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.020
Killua, I'm going all-out.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.690
You'd better!

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.650
If you don't, I'll smack you!

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.030
First comes rock!

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.160
Rock,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.250
paper...

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.690
Rock!

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.890
More powerful than anticipated.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.840
But I can catch it!

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.180
However, the momentum

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.150
will force me out of bounds!

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.050
So catching isn't an option,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.350
but I can't dodge, either!

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.410
Come...

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.510
Trying to receive it again?

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.490
Fool, that'll let Hisoka grab it!

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.740
I wouldn't be so sure...

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.150
That depends on

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.170
the direction in which I direct it!

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.310
He bounced it back!

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.960
Gon, dodge!

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.960
You'll still win!

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.840
No, he won't dodge.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.590
That isn't how he wants to win.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.850
During this match, I've learned
that much about him.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.430
He's unconscious?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.130
Oh, right.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.920
It was the aura he expended...

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.200
He truly used every ounce of strength.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.070
You can take pride in this.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.450
You've won, Gon.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.950
Not quite yet.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.460
Why would you do that?!

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.710
He desired total victory.
Right, Gon?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.480
He bounced it back again!

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.090
Interesting.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.850
Are we just rallying now?

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.960
It'll come down to stamina!

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.110
The ball is stuck...

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.120
Bungee Gum possesses the properties
of both rubber and gum.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.850
Razor, catching the ball while touching the
area out of bounds is against the rules.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.140
You're out!

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.140
Which makes Team Gon
the winner of this match!

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.140
All right!

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.940
That was amazing, guys!

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.670
Huh?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.400
What happened at the end?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.150
They beat me good...

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.450
Oh, so Hisoka finished the job.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.660
In the end, he stole all the glory.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.500
It was only possible with all of your help.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.660
Call this a victory for the team.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.510
That doesn't sound like you at all.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.170
You beat me.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.490
As promised, we'll leave the city.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.170
Oh, yeah...

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.320
That was this game's purpose.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.520
But first,

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.560
I will answer your question about Ging.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.070
Ow!

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.810
Honestly, you were so reckless!

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.810
Your hands are a total mess.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.360
Hey, are you listening?

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.930
The answer is that Ging isn't here.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.930
Nor do I know where he is.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.160
Oh...

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.580
Well, I was expecting that.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.510
But I can tell you some stories that I know.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.840
Yes, please!

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.710
I, too, was a death row convict.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.190
I was a murderer.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.780
I'd been arrested, jailed, and sentenced to die,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.770
when Ging hired me to come here.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.920
Ging taught me it took only one person,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.700
one person in the entire world who will trust you,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.490
to save you.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.930
My son will come here one day.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.590
When that happens, give him a good beating.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.130
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.480
Don't get too cocky.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.260
He is my son.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.370
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.500
I always thought your old man was insane.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.980
He'd spend hours with a death
row convict going on and on

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.020
about a game he made, like a kid would.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.770
And then he hired that convict
to fight his own son.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.650
Scum! Who do you think is letting you live?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.120
Hey...

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.010
You!

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.050
Over there!

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.650
Oh, that...

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.030
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.800
It felt like no one had ever
called me by name before.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.010
Ging believed in your strength,
so he left you to me.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.760
And I believed in your strength,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.310
which is why I didn't hold back.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.760
Yeah, but I couldn't have won
without everyone else.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.130
That was some good teamwork.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.010
Yeah.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.650
Gon, go find Ging.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.890
Yep!

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.910
This is the place.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.950
A window?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.170
We can see the shore from here.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.960
How do we reach the Sea God's Grotto from here?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.140
Directly below the point on the
surface the light points to.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.860
There's a grotto down there.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.440
But there isn't any treasure there.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.820
I'm sorry I deceived you.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.430
Really?

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.950
It's a sacred cavern,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.340
so only a few fishermen know the location.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.520
All other stories you heard were
rumors made up by others.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.640
Including the stories of treasure.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.310
But Razor and his gang wouldn't believe us.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.380
Those who make their living on
the sea can never defile it.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.230
So they said before they were all killed,
taking the secret with them.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.230
Hey...

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.740
You get that this is a story in a game, right?

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.280
I can finally see the ocean again from here.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.320
The sunrise...

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.840
The boats returning with their hauls...

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.800
The water sparkling in many colors.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.410
In my mind, this view is the true treasure.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.930
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.440
Yes! We got Patch of Shore!

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.930
Let's use Clone to make two copies.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.680
We're fine with taking the copies.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.940
Yes, you've earned the right to the original.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.210
Hisoka, you really don't want anything?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.350
No, it was quite fun.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.820
Why don't you join us?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.700
I'm curious about the Troupe's actions.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.980
I'm not interested in collecting cards.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.800
Should anything else come up,
use Contact to reach me.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.710
I'll use Accompany or Magnetic
Force to come at once.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.090
Huh?

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.480
That liar!

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.140
Huh?

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.730
We haven't used Magnetic Force
at all since Hisoka joined, right?

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.920
That means he already knew about
spell cards before he ran into us!

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.480
Killua,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.190
there are liars who only lie
when there's a reason to,

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.480
and there are liars who also lie without reason.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.350
You and I are the former.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.740
He is the latter.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.940
You won't get anywhere by fretting over it.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.500
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.240
It's been a while.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.010
Do you know who this is?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.380
Genthru?

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.090
What do you want?

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.750
First, I'd like to congratulate you.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.080
What are you talking about?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.140
Don't bother playing dumb.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.480
I promise to spare your lives.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.150
In return, hand over Patch of Shore.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.860
Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.780
Well, I am somewhat interested
to see if you can beat us.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.900
If you're willing to deal,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.520
come alone to Masadora's entrance in one hour.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.290
If you don't, we'll take the card by force.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.260
You cannot escape us.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.170
We have many copies of Accompany.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.780
How?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.450
I knew he'd find out, but not this soon!

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.180
Asta, Amana, Manheim,

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.250
Nick Cue, Souheil, Kazsule...

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.070
They were all members of
your party of fifteen.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.940
Isn't that right?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.900
Check your Binder.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.700
They're no longer with us.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.380
Book!

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.420
This means they're either dead
or no longer in the game...

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.670
Genthru!

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.740
Who are you?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.300
Gon Freecss!

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.960
I'll take you on!

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.560
Gon?

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.580
So you're one of those three kids.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.850
It appears you have Lucky Alexandrite.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.580
Once I'm done with Tsezgerra, I'll come for you.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.200
Or do you want to give up the card now?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.940
You come here this instant!

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.290
I'll fight you!

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.860
I also have—

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.530
Tsezgerra, can you move somewhere else?

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.120
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.120
This is Phinks.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.960
We found him.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.010
I'm heading your way.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.520
Wouldn't it be faster to target the kids?

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.180
They probably have a copy of Patch of Shore.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.380
But it would be a card created by Clone.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.980
That's true.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.530
Once those kids see Tsezgerra
surrender, they'll give up.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.150
If we go after the kids first,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.470
Tsezgerra will have time to recover,
and that will just give us more trouble.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.250
He is a Single Star Hunter.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.510
And we don't know what his power is.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.920
Genthru doesn't know your strength.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.920
So he believes that we are carrying
the original Patch of Shore.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.170
They want the original card...
they want "our" card.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.470
We'll try to buy as much time as possible.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.430
Use the time to regain your strength.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.930
If you want to beat this game, you'll
have no choice but to fight them.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.190
And you are the only ones
with a chance to win.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.850
But, Gon...

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.440
Just now, your actions were
both selfish and foolish.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.360
If they'd accepted your challenge and come,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.920
what would have happened
to Killua, given his injuries?

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.650
You endangered not only yourself,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.280
but your friends too, by losing
control of your emotions!

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.260
I'm sorry.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.440
Very well.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.470
It will all come down to Accompany.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.970
If we evade their use of Accompany,
we should be able to buy plenty of time.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.890
But if too much time passes,

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.310
they may decide to switch and target you.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.830
I estimate we have a one-week limit.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.360
Past that, we can't make guarantees.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.150
One week...

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.530
That isn't long.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.400
And that's probably optimistic.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.000
They may well switch to us after three days.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.340
I'll go with Tsezgerra.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.360
What about you guys?

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.330
If we're buying you time,
that implies we have an alliance.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.380
No, wait.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.830
There is little benefit from an alliance with them.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.130
The enemy already knows the
eight of us have teamed up.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.890
So we won't be able to act as decoys
while you take out Genthru.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.280
That means leaving the original versions

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.080
of the last two cards they seek,

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:33.030
#2 and #75, with any one
party would be dangerous.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.980
So my offer to buy time isn't an alliance.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.230
I'm offering a deal.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.780
A deal?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.310
Three weeks...

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.770
That's the amount of time we can buy.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:50.680
If we succeed, will you give
us #75, Lucky Alexandrite?

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.560
That doesn't make sense.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.050
You just said one week was the limit.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.300
That's assuming we stay on the run.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.570
If necessary, I can force a stalemate of sorts.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.910
I see.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.940
But for #75, we could just
tell you how to obtain it.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.960
No, we already know how.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.140
But Goreinu and the rest of us

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.940
have few empty slots left.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.510
It's no longer reasonable to turn
all our cards over to the villagers.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.770
Three weeks.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.320
That isn't enough time for
Killua's hands to heal.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.590
And it certainly isn't enough to close the
gap between Genthru's abilities and ours.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.090
Which means we should use the
time to come up with a plan.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.500
Exactly.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.630
Devise a scenario in which
you can defeat Genthru.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.730
Identify the required circumstances,
and prepare to carry out that plan.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.230
Got it.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.490
Good...

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.830
We'll leave to delay Team Genthru now.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.240
Keep this in mind, Gon...

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.490
They've already killed over
fifty players in this game.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.000
If you want to beat the game,
you'll have to fight them.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.540
Accompany on!

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.630
To Masadora!

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.190
Three weeks... That isn't much time.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.790
Killua, you focus on healing

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.440
and thinking of a plan to defeat Genthru.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.220
Right.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.280
Gon, you train with me.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.830
The first necessity is that you be
able to avoid his Little Flower.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.650
Osu!

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.200
Gon has won his match against Razor.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.320
But the bombers remain stronger
fighters than Gon's group.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.680
Will they be able to devise a viable plan?

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.210
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.860
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.550
Today, we introduce the card Clone.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:09.570
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.990
It transforms into one

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.020
random card from the player's restricted slots.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.760
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net 500G.
Very shy and quiet.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.180
Wow, Gold Dust Girl!

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.820
Gain!

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.220
Next time: Chase x And x Chance.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.410
Battera!

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.340
Sabazushi!

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.230
Battera.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.080
Barazushi.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.450
Zushi, Zushi, osu!
