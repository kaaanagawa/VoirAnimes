WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.300
Now!

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020
how good something can taste.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.270
We're risking our lives for that joy.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.530
Showdown x On The x Airship

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.560
After clearing the exam's Second Phase,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.710
Gon and his friends fly through the starry sky,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.050
toward the site for the Third Phase.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.300
Allow me to introduce myself to the
forty-two remaining applicants.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.220
I am Netero, Chairman of this year's
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.810
I am his secretary, Beans.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.860
Originally, I'd planned to
make my appearance

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.070
during the exam's final phase,
but as I'm already here...

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.290
I'm loving this tension in the air!

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.290
So I think I'll stick around for
the rest of the trip.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.500
We are scheduled to arrive

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.130
at our destination
tomorrow morning, at 8 AM.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.260
You'll find dinner waiting in the dining hall.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.800
You are also welcome to get some rest.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.950
In other words,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.810
you're free to do as you please
until you are contacted.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.200
Okay, Gon! Let's explore the airship!

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.420
Yeah!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510
How can they have so much energy?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm hitting the sack.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.320
You can say that again.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.570
However, I do have one concern...

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.420
Hmm? What's up?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.350
How many more phases are there?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.980
Oh...

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.080
They've never mentioned that,
have they?

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.710
On average, there are five to six phases.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.050
Which means we still have
three or four to go...

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.890
All the more reason to rest now.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.470
But you should be careful.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.970
Huh?

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.550
The secretary only told us when
we'll arrive at our destination.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.100
It's possible that the third exam could

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.940
take place on this airship itself.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.610
And it doesn't necessarily mean we'll
be contacted at 8 AM.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.630
Huh? Are you serious?

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.700
Hmm, that does make sense...

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.580
You might wake up to discover that
the exam has already ended.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.330
If you plan to make it to the next phase,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.840
don't let yourself relax on this airship.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.200
What the hell...

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.060
Well, that was some good advice.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.240
Thanks.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.090
We shall bear that in mind.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.330
Let's all do our best.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.650
<i>Yeah, right...</i>

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.560
<i>Here's hoping that you're
both nervous wrecks,</i>

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.100
<i>come the morning.</i>

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.110
<i>There's no chance that the next phase
will be held on the airship.</i>

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.190
<i>Were that their intention,</i>

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.600
<i>they wouldn't have said that we were
free to do as we pleased.</i>

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.700
<i>They would have told us to stand by.</i>

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.290
Hey, how many applicants
do you expect to make it?

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.190
You mean pass the exam?

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.920
Yep. This year, we have
an impressive group.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.970
Though I did fail them all at one point...

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.590
But doesn't it depend

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.160
on what the upcoming phases consist of?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.730
That's true...

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.310
But didn't you notice it?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.070
One of them had this whole
aura thing going on.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.230
What do you think, Satotz?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.680
Oh, yes.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.240
I like the rookies this year.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.230
Ha! So you agree?

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.730
I think #294 has a good shot.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.360
I'm partial to #99.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.300
He looks like a selfish, spoiled brat.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.280
What do you think, Buhara?

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.900
Well...

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.010
He isn't a rookie,
but #44 is the one I favor.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.800
I'm sure you noticed,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.220
but when #255 was throwing a fit,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.650
it was #44 who was really on the verge
of killing someone.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.200
I did notice that, of course.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.530
He could barely restrain himself
from tearing off our heads.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.320
But didn't you realize?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.850
He was already that way

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.120
from the first moment we appeared.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.160
Really?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.400
Yeah, that's the real reason
I was so edgy.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.670
He kept challenging me.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.470
I had a similar experience.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.180
He should be carefully monitored.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.260
Though it pains me to admit this,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.050
we are birds of a feather with him.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.060
However, his affinity
for darkness is far stronger.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.670
As Hunters, we are continually
seeking out rivals.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.350
Ultimately, the Hunter Exam

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.040
is but a place to find opponents
worthy of respect.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.240
And every once in a while, we encounter

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.360
someone who hits the floor running,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.170
when we try to slow things down.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.710
An oddball of sorts.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.010
Hey, there! Kids!

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.890
Stay out of the kitchen!

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.660
Go eat in the dining hall!

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.660
Wow, awesome!

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.530
Look, Gon!

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.770
Hmm? What is it?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.770
Whoa!

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.830
It's like the ground is covered in jewels!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.770
Yeah!

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.090
Hey, I was wondering...

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880
Hmm?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.880
Where are your mom and dad?

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.840
Hmm... They're alive.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.680
Probably.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.360
What do they do?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.790
They're assassins.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.290
Huh? Both of them?

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.980
That's your first reaction?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.120
You really are a riot!

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.050
Huh?

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.630
You're the first person who's
ever responded seriously.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.560
Well, you're telling the truth, right?

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.560
What makes you think that?

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.530
It's just a hunch.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.470
That's weird...

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.810
People only like me

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.960
because they can't ever tell
whether I'm serious.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.420
I'm from a family of assassins.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.860
So they're all assassins.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.150
And my family has

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.360
really high hopes for me...

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.650
But I can't stand it.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.090
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.030
When I told them I wanted to
decide my own future,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.400
they all snapped!

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.720
My mother had tears

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.410
streaming down her face, as she told me

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.520
I have the potential to be a top assassin.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.920
Horrible parents, right?

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.550
It's natural their kid would go bad.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.070
We ended up fighting.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.560
So I stabbed my mother in the face,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.020
my brother in the side,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.630
and ran away from home.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.850
I'm sure they're out for blood now.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.540
But if they find me,
I'll send them packing.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.060
When I become a Hunter,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.620
I'll start by capturing my family.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.580
I'm sure they're worth some
hefty bounties...

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.720
Something wrong?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.560
Ah, Netero-san...

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.730
Did you see anyone

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.510
coming from that side?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.730
No.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.230
<i>When did he...</i>

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.810
You're pretty fast for an old man.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.540
That little trick?

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.490
I barely moved.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.020
What do you want?

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.710
You don't have to do anything

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.250
until the last phase, right?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.940
No need to be so unkind.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.510
I got bored, and was looking
for some companions.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.160
By the way, I meant to ask
the two of you...

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.010
Any thoughts on your first attempt
at the Hunter Examination?

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.240
Uh-huh! It's fun!

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.300
And there haven't been any of the
written exams I was dreading.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.130
I'm disappointed...

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.760
I expected the exam to be
far more difficult.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.030
I assume the next phase will
be more entertaining?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.030
Well, now...
I wouldn't know about that.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.630
Let's go, Gon!

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.430
Now wait just a moment.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.040
Would you care to play a game with me?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.290
A game?

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.800
If you're able to defeat me,
I shall let you be Hunters!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.050
Really? I'll play!

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.190
How about it, eh?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:53.150
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.150
Netero

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.810
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.090
If you can take this ball from me,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.250
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.760
I believe that we're scheduled
for an 8 AM arrival?

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.030
Well, that still gives you nine hours.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.760
You're free to attack me
however you'd like.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.450
I won't touch you.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.810
Huh? That's too easy.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.390
You can't call that a game.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.400
Why not give it a try first?

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.400
We just have to take the ball?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400
Yeah.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.650
Then I'll go first.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.660
Go ahead.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.410
<i>He's looking down on me.</i>

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.430
I see lots of Killuas!

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.430
<i>This is an assassination technique.</i>

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.690
<i>Rhythm Echo...</i>

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.240
<i>Practitioners use a certain rhythm
to create after-images,</i>

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.190
<i>confusing the enemy.</i>

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.130
<i>I am astonished that such a young child</i>

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.200
<i>has already mastered that technique.</i>

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.850
<i>Damn, he keeps darting around.</i>

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.100
<i>Is he really an old man?</i>

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.860
What? That's it?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.370
<i>In that case,</i>

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.730
<i>I'll stop his movement!</i>

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.740
Ouch... Right on his pivot leg!

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.520
Ow!

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.630
<i>He didn't hold back with that kick.</i>

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.260
<i>If I were an ordinary person,
that would have shattered my leg.</i>

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.190
<i>Damn...</i>

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.890
<i>His legs are hard as iron...</i>

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.990
Killua!

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.150
Tag! Tag!

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.520
It's my turn!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.970
<i>What will this kid try?</i>

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.400
<i>He appears to be a very honest boy.</i>

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.150
Okay!

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.220
<i>Oh... He has a quick first step.</i>

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.060
<i>But he'd need another ten years</i>

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.290
<i>before attacking me head-on.</i>

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.210
<i>I guess he is just a child.</i>

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.450
<i>Huh? From above?</i>

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.580
Ow!

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.340
Idiot!

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.990
We know that you can jump
really high!

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.170
Control your strength!

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.720
For a moment, the old man
relaxed his guard!

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.350
<i>No kidding...</i>

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.860
<i>He may appear simple-minded,
but he clearly uses his head.</i>

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.610
I messed up there.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.120
<i>They should keep me entertained
until the morning.</i>

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.630
<i>Those two were pretty shaken.</i>

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.590
<i>I bet they're too nervous</i>

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.320
<i>to get a wink of sleep...</i>

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.140
<i>They're sound asleep?</i>

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.150
You boys aren't getting anywhere.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.760
Why not attack simultaneously?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.700
Why, you...

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.460
Okay... I'll get you this time!

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.290
Here they come.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.550
<i>Netero-san hasn't even broken a sweat.</i>

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.350
Ow!

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.940
<i>So we can't beat him
without subterfuge.</i>

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.150
Your attacks are getting boring.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.080
<i>He kicked off his shoe to
increase his range?</i>

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.710
A chance!

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.010
I think not.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.090
You and your little tricks!

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.770
It's mine!

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.860
I commend you on your efforts.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.870
You're amazing, Netero-san!

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.230
Really amazing!

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.870
Forget it...

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.790
I give up.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.130
I lose!

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.820
Huh?

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.880
<i>Oh? He's quitting?</i>

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.890
Why? We still have time.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.890
And just now, we came really close.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.390
Jeez. You really have no clue, do you?

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.470
The old man has barely used his
right hand and his left leg.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.030
What?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.820
But we're still powerless against him.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.200
We could chase him around for a year,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.740
and never take the ball from him.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.940
Oh, you figured it out?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.660
And here, I thought I'd fooled you.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.530
So that's what he was doing.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.020
You really know how to
piss me off, old man.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.590
Let's go, Gon!

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.650
Oh, I'm gonna play a little longer.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.170
Huh?

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.910
Didn't you hear what I said?!

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.620
It's useless!

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.920
You won't be able to take
the ball from him!

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.180
Yeah! I don't care about the ball.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.060
We've only used up half
of the time limit.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.320
I'm gonna make Netero-san
use his right hand

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.560
before the time runs out.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.820
I see...

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.250
Yeah, I got it.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.450
Good luck.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.710
I'm getting some sleep.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.950
Say, Netero-san...

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.840
Hmm?

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.410
How did Killua do that thing
where he walked slowly,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.400
and it looked like there were
a bunch of Killuas?

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.780
That technique is for those engaged
in underground work.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.340
You have no need to learn it.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.380
In fact, you should not learn it.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.400
But it's an amazing technique, right?

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.540
It requires an intensive amount
of training.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.310
Killua's really something!

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.820
You fool.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.870
<i>Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood.</i>

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.060
<i>Well, I guess there's
nothing for it.</i>

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.120
Hey.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.870
Wait up, kid.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080
You bump into us,
and then ignore us?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.300
Bastard!

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.960
<i>If I hadn't stopped then,</i>

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.390
<i>I'd have ended up killing that
old man to get the ball.</i>

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:14.110
<i>Oh, he's moving faster.</i>

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.110
<i>Here it comes!</i>

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.970
<i>He'll feint for the ball,</i>

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.620
<i>but attack my stomach!</i>

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.160
O-Ouch!

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.620
One more!

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.200
<i>If he head-butts me in the stomach again,</i>

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.130
<i>he'll shatter his skull.</i>

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.640
<i>But if I relax my stomach,
I'll be the one suffering.</i>

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.140
I'll run away.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.900
Ah, is he dead?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.410
You just used your right hand!

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.660
I did it!

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.420
Hooray...

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.860
Hello, helmsman?

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.300
It's me. Is the flight going well?

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.590
I see.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.690
I'm sorry to ruin it for you,

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.930
but could you fly a little slower?

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.850
During a game Netero proposed to kill time,

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.160
he's seen something in Gon.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.630
The airship and its 42 applicants

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.670
approach the site of the exam's Third Phase.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.280
Next time: Decision x By x Majority?

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.220
Majority, majority...

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.510
Authority!

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.200
Minority?
