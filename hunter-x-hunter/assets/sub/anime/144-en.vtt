00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.740
Do you need something?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740
I heard that you're leaving tomorrow.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.870
You're abandoning the election and your son?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.490
That bald fool!

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.370
Why did he tell her?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.160
Why don't you stay and see this through?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.060
We already know the election's outcome.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.060
I've had my fun.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.860
Meeting that Leorio guy was the best part.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.380
He shows a lot of promise.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.960
What are you talking about?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.300
We're down to four candidates.
We don't know the outcome.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.270
That's what I'm saying.
See? You do understand.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.980
Approval x And x Coalition

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.860
I plan on voting for you today.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.540
See ya around.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.860
What in the world are you talking about?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.370
Are you stupid?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.080
I'm saying the outcome will be
that there is no outcome!

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620
Want to know how many days
it'll be before this is over?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.130
How can you possibly know that?

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.540
Because you and Mizai are in this to win.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.870
But if you really wanted to win,
you should have tried harder before.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.550
You needed to use any means necessary

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.750
during the second or third
votes to secure a majority,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020
and clear the turnout requirement.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.190
Why are you telling me this now?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.350
It's easy to say whatever you want in hindsight.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.350
If I'd warned you beforehand,
you'd have done the opposite.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.030
You're so difficult!

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.540
Well, I don't care if you think
this is hindsight speaking.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.160
You can tell yourself that until the day this ends.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.430
Wait!

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.200
What do you want?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.920
I'll do as you say.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.120
What should I do?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.670
You don't sound too happy about it.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.770
I don't know what Pariston is thinking.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.480
How do I beat him?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.820
Except you've never done anything
I've told you to do...

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.990
Okay, I'll start with what Pariston's thinking, then.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.450
He doesn't want to win.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.160
But he doesn't want to lose, either.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.530
That's what makes him strong.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.060
What? How can that be?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.790
Yeah, I know.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.290
Common sense tells you that people
who want to win are stronger, right?

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.930
Nothing wrong with that. You're right.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.180
And being right makes you predictable.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.170
That goes especially for when you want to win

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.560
a game where you're trying to secure votes.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.190
Game?

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.780
See? You thought I was being disrespectful, right?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.200
You're mad because you're big on morals,
balance, and sticking to the manual.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.970
Look at me.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.320
You're failing to act like a dog.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.200
You're just being yourself.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.200
Pariston is familiar with both sides
of you, so he knows that.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.720
He knows exactly what you're
thinking and what you'll do next.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.630
And even then, he doesn't want to win.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.970
He's damn good, right?

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.310
Then what do I do?

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.880
I told you...

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.810
If I tell you what to do, you'll never listen.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.480
How many times must we go through this?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.990
Okay, I'll tell you what happens
if the game continues as is.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.490
First, you and Pariston will be the ones
remaining after the next vote.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.620
In the two-candidate vote after
that, first and second will flip.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.250
And that's what will keep happening.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.750
Pariston will probably try
to lower the turnout rate.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.510
The Association Hunters he has
control over will refuse to vote.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.040
Why?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.680
Like I said...

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.130
He doesn't want to win or lose.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.770
He'll drag things out until the very last day.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.840
He's just looking to have fun.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.170
He's like Netero and me.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.150
Well, I get bored a lot more quickly...

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.900
But he has more patience.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.280
Of the four remaining candidates,
Pariston is the only one

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.160
who carries on Netero's will.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.410
You have no right to say that!

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.900
You're only jealous of him.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.670
Were you that fond of the dirty old man?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.300
Shut your mouth!

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.800
Don't get too full of yourself!

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.310
You just have to tell me the day
when this election will end,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.310
you stupid vagabond!

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.810
Okay, I can do that...

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.760
But before this is over, you
should learn to act in character.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.130
You're impossible to talk to.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.130
The day Netero blew himself up,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.550
one hundred large airships belonging
to the Hunter Association

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.450
set off for East Gorteau.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.800
There's no record of their departure.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.580
All records show that they're
in hangars for maintenance.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.440
You had no idea, did you?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.710
You should make friends with
some mechanics and pilots.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.150
What are you talking about?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.710
They're recovering approximately
five thousand cocoons.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.120
Cocoons containing chimera mutants.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.580
They all have the ability to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.780
And they're all probably about to hatch.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.400
Pariston plans to have some fun with them,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.360
now that he has such a huge playground.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.610
The day the election ends will be
the day of the next Hunter Exam.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.840
However, if the Commandments are reformed,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.120
the situation will change slightly.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.200
You'll have to figure out the rest yourself.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.910
Aren't you a Hunter?

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.680
Okay, we will now hold the eighth vote
for the election of the 13th chairman.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.520
Today, we will start by listening to speeches
from the four remaining candidates.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.780
After some debate among the candidates,
we will move on to the vote.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.030
How did this happen?

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.280
Oh, I guess it's my fault...

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.460
Now, first,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.840
we have comments from the
candidates who did not qualify.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.040
First, I would like to thank everyone
who supported me. Thank you.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.250
And if possible,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:12.300
going forward, I would ask those who had
faith in me to give your votes to Cheadle.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.090
The Zodiacs are not united.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.700
However, there are those among
us who share very similar goals.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.560
And the one who shares my goal is Cheadle.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:31.470
Her desire to maintain balance will lead
the Association in a better direction.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.370
Where you people are now is not
my reality, so do what you want.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.330
Ging!! Don't try to run while you're
ahead!! Get back here!!

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.390
We will now begin the speeches
from the candidates.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.720
There is one thing to note.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.220
Everyone who's gathered inside the hall today

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:00.480
will be asked to stay until the 13th
chairman has been selected.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.880
Anyone inside?

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.030
Only Tsubone and Canary.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.760
How's Master Alluka?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.570
She's still asleep.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.290
I'm waiting for her to wake up.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.790
It won't be much longer.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.400
Just a little longer, Gon!

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.200
It's possible that we will
continue to have multiple ties,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.620
but we've arranged for all necessary provisions,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.760
so you can rest easy repeating the vote as
many times as necessary, be it for hours or days.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.840
Let me repeat myself.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.090
You may not leave this hall until the
13th chairman has been selected.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:04.540
Now, we'll start with a speech from
the candidate in fourth, Mizaistom.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.560
This is bad.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.990
To eliminate Pariston, I will
serve as a sacrificial lamb.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.210
I'll make this quick.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.480
Of the four candidates on stage,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.870
I believe the one most qualified to be chairman

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.620
is Cheadle.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.770
I won't say that I'm not willing
to become chairman.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.590
But it isn't my time.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.270
First, I must train the Hunters under me,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.010
and work to become a Triple Hunter.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:47.020
I would appreciate it if you'd respect my
wishes, and help end this election today.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.000
That's all I have to say.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.520
What should I say?

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.400
Next, we have the candidate
in third, Cheadle-san.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.690
All yours.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.550
I'll also make this quick.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.290
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the 13th chairman

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.830
should be Leorio.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.420
That's all I have to say.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.600
What is Cheadle up to?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.030
I'm not gonna be elected.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.680
I don't even want to be elected.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.570
But I guess I should say what I want.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.300
My focus right now isn't this election, anyway.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.320
Okay... Thank you.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.220
Next, we have the candidate
in second, Leorio-san.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.340
All yours.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.950
You aren't smiling anymore, Pariston.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.710
I won't let you have your way!

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.200
Huh?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.160
Leorio-san, could you please speak?

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.820
Leorio-san!

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.870
Damn it, Leorio!

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.600
Are you asleep?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.840
I'll strangle you!

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.290
Ah! Me?

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.390
Nope, I'm drawing a blank.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.740
What am I doing up here?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.800
Forget it.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.490
In that case...

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.120
I'll just say what's on my mind.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.260
If elected chairman, I'll treat the
Association like it belongs to me!

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:49.770
My first command will be to order
all of you to help save Gon!

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.740
This isn't where I should be right now.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:05.160
Well, it isn't like I could help
Gon if I were with him...

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.410
He's... Gon is fighting for his life now.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.320
He's a buddy. A friend.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.300
But I only found out recently.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.740
While I was studying for myself,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.290
drinking, moving from place to place,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.520
jerking off, entertaining women,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.440
and surfing the Internet...

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.070
He was fighting for others.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.130
Alongside the former chairman and their allies.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.740
One of them has put his life
on the line to save Gon.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.680
All I could do was talk to Gon.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.460
That's all I can do.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.240
So if I become chairman,
I won't stop talking to you.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.360
Please help save Gon!

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.130
Use your heads!

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.750
If you have an idea, take action!

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.240
If there's something I can do, tell me.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.550
I'll do anything!

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.360
Ging...

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.870
I think I understand why you
didn't avoid his punch.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.250
Even from that moment,
you saw something in him.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.700
I'm fine with having him as chairman.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.280
Damn, I think I said more than I needed to.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.160
Forget the part about jerking off.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.620
I'm done.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.330
If we're there to support him,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.460
I'm sure he'll make a good chairman.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.900
Finally, we have the candidate
in first place, Pariston-san.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.150
All yours.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.380
Everyone, please be quiet!

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.080
It's over, Pariston.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.880
It doesn't matter what you say.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.390
My eighty-seven votes,
Mizai's seventy-two votes,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.270
and the fifty-seven independent votes

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.020
will be added to Leorio's ninety-five.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.100
That gives him three hundred, eleven votes.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.400
He'll have over fifty percent of the vote.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.400
The 13th chairman will be Leorio.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.080
Everyone, please quiet down.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.910
Refrain from using mobile phones.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.540
Um, in a moment, I'm going to get loud.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.850
Everyone, you can continue
talking on the phone.

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.340
This is the true Hunter spirit.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.240
Once this election ends, I promise to
do everything I can to help Gon-kun.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.070
However, we must keep that matter
separate from the election.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:23.190
Of the remaining candidates,
the one most qualified to be chairman

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.190
is Mizaistom-san.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:40.460
Heart <c.color434340>Is Valuable</c>

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.520
There's something I've learned

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.710
after serving as Chairman Netero's
Vice Chairman for three years.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.460
There are three conditions a chairman needs.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.960
First is combat ability.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.330
This is an absolute necessity,
given our job requirements.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.710
During the recent crisis, this was evident.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.220
Second is experience.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.460
Wisdom comes from experience!

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.850
As a Hunter, you can never have
too many years of experience.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.850
Why?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.110
Why do I feel so irritated when he's talking?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.850
And the third is caliber.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.240
I know why...

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.520
I understand him.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.240
He never says what he truly thinks.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.320
There aren't too many people who make you think

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.290
that the Association would be in good
hands if they were chairman.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.780
Cheadle lacks combat ability.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.750
Leorio-san lacks experience.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.630
Stop... Don't let emotions get the best of me.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.170
And I lack all three!

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.670
Hey, you were supposed to laugh.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.140
I need to figure out what he's after.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:50.650
I believe that Mizaistom-san is the only
one possessing all three qualities.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.910
One hundred and twenty of Pariston's two
hundred ninety are Association Hunters.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.750
Thirty of the votes come from

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.010
the investigative and administrative
departments he heads.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.860
Pariston is able to control those votes

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.920
as he likes without any signs or speeches.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.200
We will now move on to the
debate among the candidates.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.500
Pariston's speech will create a split

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.300
among the independents, who were all
most likely leaning toward Leorio.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.440
I'm guessing this is how it will look.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:35.190
Leorio: Leorio votes, Cheadle votes, Morel votes, Teradein votes
Pariston: Association Hunter and Administrative
Department votes, Pariston personal votes
Mizaistom: Mizai votes, Pariston votes
Cheadle: Mizai votes

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.760
But that would just push the
election out another vote,

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.700
which matches our goal.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.200
Will something change during the debate?

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.210
Fine, then... I'll figure this out myself!

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.030
Can I go first, then?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.090
No, I go first.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.470
As I said earlier, I'm not interested
in becoming chairman.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.770
No, you said that you wouldn't say
you're not willing to become chairman.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.580
However, this isn't about what you want, Mizai-san.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.570
What matters is how the voters feel.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.830
Sometimes, there are situations where a job
can only be done by a certain person.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.500
That's where caliber comes in.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.960
You shouldn't be talking about how you feel.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.650
Stop the petty tricks, and let the voters decide.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.300
You have the nerve to say that?

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.980
But why is he pushing Mizai?

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.280
Does he expect us

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.880
to let greed get the better of
us and push Mizai to second?

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.920
That will never happen!

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.890
Because the votes for Leorio
are primarily independent.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.870
If Leorio loses, they're likely to swing to Pariston.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.770
But if Leorio remains,

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.630
the votes previously cast for myself
and the openly anti-Pariston Mizai

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.150
will go to Leorio.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.090
He'll hold on to Teradein's anti-Zodiac votes,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.850
and the Morel votes are also anti-Pariston.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.510
Meaning that they'll never switch to Pariston.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.040
Got it, Mizai?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.780
Yeah, I understand.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.610
Defeating Pariston is the ultimate goal.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.330
As a Crime Hunter, I trust my instinct.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.660
There's no proof, and it's entirely possible
that his hands are clean.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.060
However...

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.710
He definitely has underground ties.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.020
We can't let him run rampant within
the Association any longer.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.300
Since it appears that not even
Netero could rein him in...

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.330
This election is where we must...

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.580
...tear down Pariston's system.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.860
And so, the eighth vote for
the 13th chairman begins.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.130
The votes fly.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.450
Is he defeated?

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.890
As Killua takes Something's hand,
everything approaches its end.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.940
Next time: Defeat x And x Reunion.
