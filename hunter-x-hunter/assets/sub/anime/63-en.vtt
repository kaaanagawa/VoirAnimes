WEBVTT

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.480
I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm not big on formalities,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.490
so call me Bisky.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.470
In return, you must obey every
word of what I teach you.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.740
No way. And no, thanks.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.480
We're not desperate enough to beg
a total stranger to train us!

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Say something, Gon.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.750
We have Wing-san.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.000
Right, right.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.850
We already have a master,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.010
and we don't need anyone else to teach us.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.590
Wing?

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.270
You mean that little boy with
messy hair and glasses?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.320
The one who never tucks in his shirt?

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.640
Do you know him?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.330
Do I know him?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.150
Wing's one of my students.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.180
Seriously?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150
That's awesome!

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.980
So he's become a master now...

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.440
Time really flies, huh?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.450
Does that mean you're pro Hunters?

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.160
Oh, just me.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.030
You've passed the secret exam?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.040
Yep.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560
That really takes me back...

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.050
I'd love to serve as an examiner again.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.180
Well, I'm essentially your master's master,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.340
so you shouldn't have any
problems with my teaching you.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.060
A x Hard x Master

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.770
Wow!

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.480
You've been an examiner!

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690
Assuming that she's telling the truth.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.330
You're a stubborn little boy.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.440
I like to see that in kids.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.270
You said that you weren't desperate, right?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.800
Book.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.580
That card...

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.580
Marimo-chi
A super-fast ball-like
creature about as hard
as rubber. Deals little
damage, but can be
annoying if it smacks
you in the face.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.050
Look carefully.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.800
Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.580
It's a normal card that doesn't
go in a restricted slot.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.330
The problem is that

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.900
there are many people who
could have effortlessly

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.090
obtained this card, while you two could not.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.850
If you run into someone who's
stronger and has evil intentions...

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.850
Sit down...
Pretend that we're chatting.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.110
There's an enemy behind me.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.420
Three kids?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.700
I'll cut them apart.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.460
Don't probe for him.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.330
He'll notice.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.830
How did you sense him?

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.340
He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.590
The enemy saw a bunch of kids,
and he relaxed for a second.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.090
Doesn't that mean he's weak?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.660
He immediately concealed his presence again.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.980
It was only the slightest bloodlust,
and he quickly concealed it,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.600
so he's pretty good.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.810
We couldn't even sense his presence,
let alone locate him.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.360
What should we do?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.590
He's fast on the uptake!

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.120
This boy's bright.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.720
What do you think?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.800
We three should move together.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.220
Why do you say that?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.470
I'm guessing he decided to use caution

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.630
because there are three of us.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.210
If we stick together,
he'll be less eager to attack.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.380
I agree.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.130
Well, you're right.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.820
But that's not what we're going to do.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.950
If I go off on my own,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.840
the enemy is one hundred percent
guaranteed to attack me.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.790
I'll go south. You boys, go north.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.770
Walk five hundred meters without
concealing your presences.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.460
Aim for that pillar.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.650
Once you get there, use <i>Zetsu</i>,
then rush back immediately!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.660
Okay, stalk the stalker—

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.620
Huh?

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.270
Fine, then! Be that way!

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.620
Damned hag...

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.910
I've had enough!

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.100
Bye-bye.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.550
Yeah, get lost!

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.150
We didn't want you around!

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.130
Come on, Gon!

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.100
Let's go.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.140
Oh, they're acting.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.560
So long, stupid!

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.160
That woman really is something.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.770
Huh?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.040
I was on full alert,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.030
so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.120
But I didn't realize what she'd done

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.160
until my cheek began to sting.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.440
Let's hurry back.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.040
Yeah.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.680
I just cut your hair...

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.100
With my Scissor Hands!

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.660
When I eat the hair I cut,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.350
I can learn things about the owner's body

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.020
that they don't even know about themselves.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.800
Muscle tone, potential for
disease, genetic strengths!

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.210
I will learn everything about your body

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.970
before I begin to toy with it...

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.300
Age fifty-seven?!

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.190
And she looks like this?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.690
What's even scarier is how honed her body is.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.440
I can see

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.440
her physical appearance conceals

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.200
the strength she's achieved

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700
through intensive training.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.830
My fighter's spirit insists that
I challenge you to a duel.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.630
I guess you aren't a total deviant.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.210
Very well.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.620
You're lucky.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.280
If I'd used my <i>Nen</i>, you would be dead.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.750
During that battle, what did you see first?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.160
The guy being flipped through the air.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.380
Same here.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.630
Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.130
She's just that strong!

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.800
If he were an in-game character,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.640
he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.140
It would have been an instant
game over for you boys.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.780
That makes the second time

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.590
I've seen you barely escape death.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.590
How long will your good fortune last?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.280
Bisky-san...

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.500
Just call me Bisky.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.990
If you insist on an honorific,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.870
call me Bisky-chama!

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.790
I'll just call you Hag.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.290
Why are you here, Bisky?

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.090
Well, I'm here to clear the game,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.010
but I'm mainly after a jewel.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.920
A jewel?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.220
There's a jewel that can only be found here.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.810
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.670
It goes in restricted slot #81...

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.300
Blue Planet.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.810
What about you boys?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.660
We're here to clear the game, obviously.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.130
Actually, my dad made this game.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.320
Oh?

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.460
I'm looking for my dad,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.140
so I thought this game might contain a lead.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.180
Who's your dad?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.330
Ging Freecss.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.720
Ging?!

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.730
You know him?

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.080
You bet I do!

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.970
He's famous.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.050
Chairman Netero once said

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.840
he was one of the top five <i>Nen</i> users...

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.340
Bisky, if you'd be willing to
postpone your treasure hunt,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.600
please teach us <i>Nen</i>!

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.900
You've finally come around?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.980
I'm a lot tougher than Wing.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.820
Are you ready?

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.780
Yes!

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.040
What about you?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.180
I'll be fine.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.250
Take out all your cards.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.230
Book.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.250
I'm going to give you a chance.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.250
You must evade their attacks for two weeks!

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.910
If you're successful, I'll let you escape.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.630
If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.610
I will kill you.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.410
I just have to avoid their attacks, right?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.160
It doesn't matter what I do to them?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.270
Sure.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.180
But there's one rule.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.620
You aren't allowed to leave this crater.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.140
If you break this rule, you lose,

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.600
and I'll kill you.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.780
What about us?

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.140
The same rules apply.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.040
If you leave, or fail to defeat
him after two weeks,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.710
you'll be punished.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.020
You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.820
Yeah.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.050
There's a bounty on his head, as well.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.510
He's a brutal murderer.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.040
Begin!

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.790
Why are you standing around?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.430
He's trying to heal up!

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.130
Are you going to let him?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.800
If he weren't injured,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.210
I would have lost my eye!

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.550
We can't get close to him...

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.390
Should I use this?

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.560
But while I charge up, he won't stay still.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.390
Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.690
Attrition?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.670
You get some rest.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.310
I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.950
We'll switch every six hours.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.620
Rocks?

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.050
That's a good idea.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.490
That's exactly what I need...

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.890
If I can rest like this for a week,
I'll be more or less recovered.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.460
Once I'm healed, I can finish them off.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.690
He's using the rock as a shield!

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.800
Correct!

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.570
You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.160
Makes sense.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.650
Damn!

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.470
They have too much stamina!

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.190
I won't have any time to rest!

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.900
Binolt may be injured,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.590
but making him uncomfortable
in half a day is still impressive.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.200
They're conscious that their lives
are on the line in this fight.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.870
Not bad at all.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.930
These boys are raw gems!

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.290
That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.710
That hidden, bottomless potential.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.310
If properly cut through training,
he can be completely transformed...

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.330
Like a diamond!

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.180
And this boy is a cool, calm blue.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.340
He may look fragile,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.930
but with the right amount of heat, he can
achieve semi-permanent strength...

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.110
Like a sapphire!

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.960
Why does my heart skip

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.200
whenever I see something
waiting to be polished?

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.990
I'll train them well!

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.530
What?

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.350
A forest of rocks.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.530
It impedes their enemy,
while concealing their presences.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.000
This won't take two weeks.
They'll finish it in a day.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.230
Game over, pops!

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.690
Stop, Killua!

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.990
Why did you stop me, Gon?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.890
We still have plenty of time.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.860
Let's continue until we're both
able to take him alone.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.830
Huh?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.340
Stopping now would be a waste.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.580
Because we're on a roll.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.590
Fool...

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.000
It's my turn.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.840
I'll slice you up!

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.720
Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.060
You should get some rest.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.350
You've been slowing down.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.590
True.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.170
If it takes both of us to beat a single
injured, exhausted man,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.730
we won't stand a chance
against any of the rest.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.470
You won't be able to fool their
acute antennae now.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.580
Binolt, your potential pales
in comparison to theirs.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.760
Oh, my wallet's missing.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.520
Really? You had it a moment ago.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.770
Excuse me...

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.520
You dropped this...

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.040
Day two...

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.700
He's slowing down.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.220
No, we're getting faster.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.690
Practice pays off that much more

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.630
when you're fighting an equal for your life.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.580
Damn...

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.330
Damn!

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.840
I never...

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.590
I never wanted

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.620
to live this way!

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.850
That's why I was against this!

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.970
You're the one who said
this would be a shortcut.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.870
Now it's my fault?

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.230
Look at my clothes...
They're dirty now.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.350
I wasn't looking for a reward...

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.630
I wasn't expecting any gratitude...

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.740
I just...

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.120
That's enough.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.560
There's no way I can defeat you.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.340
Kill me.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.820
Why? We won't kill you.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.130
You've helped us make a lot of progress.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.010
Thank you, Binolt-san!

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.360
I only wanted

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.770
to lead a normal life.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.410
Go on.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.910
Once I leave, I'll turn myself in.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.160
Gon...

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.140
You're flawless,

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.030
a perfect gem.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.840
But that pure nature could be your undoing.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.280
Well, let's head for Masadora.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.290
Osu!

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.420
The number 9!

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.530
Too slow!

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.550
Give me three thousand push-ups.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.860
Damn...

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.280
Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.810
That's a three-hour trip, at most.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.060
Seriously?

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.450
Oh, there it is!

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.950
City of Magic
Masadora

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.950
Let's find a department store now!

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.340
They're only selling cards...

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.690
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.250
Let's return to that rocky area.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.960
What?!

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.010
Gain!

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.010
These are the cards you bought?

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.970
Yep.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.920
We'll head back to Masadora now.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.420
However,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.940
we'll go in a straight line!

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.970
Huh? A straight line?

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.100
You can't mean...

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.640
Yep!

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.480
It's time to dig!

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.470
The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.240
Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.070
This is rough...

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.050
No more...

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.850
Hold on.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.420
If you're going to rest, sit properly.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.470
Huh?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.050
Starting today, you must always
sleep in this position.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.740
Don't let go of the rope.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.750
There's a chance I might cut the rope,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.360
so keep a portion of your
brain alert while you sleep.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.300
My old man put me through this
kind of training all the time.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.890
Ow!

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.820
Okay, when it falls,
you have to put it back up.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.840
Gon, your head...

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.300
I'm good...

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.180
I'll be making them bigger.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.540
Gon...

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.900
I'm good!

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.980
Ow!

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.530
We've run into a really hard rock.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.950
Can we dig it up?

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.990
I don't think a shovel will work.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.330
I can probably break it with a <i>Nen</i> punch.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.290
What's wrong?

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.610
Killua, what were you doing with
your aura while digging?

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.920
I wasn't doing anything unusual.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.680
Think of the shovel as part of your body!

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.680
I see.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.580
If we shroud the shovel in aura,
our digging will be stronger!

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.440
Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.850
Okay! Let's keep on digging!

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.490
They've learned a new application of </i>Ten<i>, </i>Shu<i>!

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:35.860
Surround

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.860
Once we reach Masadora,
they'll have completed the first stage.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:44.580
How will Bisky's grueling training
transform the two boys?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.650
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.750
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.090
Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:14.750
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.930
It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.430
She's going through all this just for a stone?

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.550
That hag has weird taste...

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.170
Continue!

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.630
Next time: Strengthen x And x Threaten.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.880
Strengthen!

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.930
Ahem!

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.100
Don't threaten!

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.430
Ahem!
