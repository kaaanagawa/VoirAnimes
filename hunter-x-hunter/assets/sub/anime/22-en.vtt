WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This country allows ordinary tourists.

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.170
That's where we'll find Killua?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.030
By airship, it will take three days to reach...

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.500
When do we leave?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.770
Today! Right now!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.320
Yeah, no objection from me!

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.780
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.170
I'm from a family of assassins.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.110
So they're all assassins.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.460
And the family has

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.570
really high hopes for me...

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.840
But I can't stand it.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.590
Killua...

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.880
What's with the long face, Gon?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.030
We'll be in the Republic of
Padokea by morning.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.320
You'll see Killua soon enough.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.030
Yep!

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.040
We'll definitely take Killua back with us!

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.050
A x Dangerous x Watchdog

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.810
Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.220
in the Dentora region

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.730
of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.730
There it is.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.990
The base for this family of
assassins is on that mountain?

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.990
It sure looks creepy...

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.120
Yes.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.740
Once we reach our destination,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.390
we should start gathering information.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.120
Okay.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.130
Kukuroo Mountain?

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.130
In that case, you should take the
scenic mountain bus tour over there.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.170
The tour only runs once a day,
but you'll have a guide

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.130
to show you around.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.740
Okay...

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.200
Thank you for taking the
Lamentation Tour today.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.810
We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.440
home to the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.280
Look.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.950
They obviously aren't tourists.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.000
Yes...

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.950
Everyone?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.830
Please look to your right.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.340
That is Kukuroo Mountain,
where the Zoldyck family lives.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.570
A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.170
and the Zoldyck estate is
somewhere on that mountain.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.430
But no one has ever actually seen it.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.280
The Zoldyck family includes ten members:

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.150
a great-grandfather, grandfather,
grandmother, father, mother,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.480
and then, there are five children.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.250
All of them are assassins!

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.980
Then, let us approach the mountain.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.000
That's really something.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.500
This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.950
Also known as the Door to Hades

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.460
because no one who's entered
has ever returned alive.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.930
To enter, you must pass through the door

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.760
beside the security checkpoint.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.530
But the area beyond the gate
is private property,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.010
so we can't proceed.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.880
Hold on!

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.270
This is the front gate?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.580
The mountain's all the way over there!

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.730
Correct...

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.650
The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.500
as well as the surrounding land.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.520
This whole area is their backyard?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.970
Hey, guide...

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.660
Yes?

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.660
What do we have to do to get inside?

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.920
Little boy, were you listening
to my explanation?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.070
Uh-huh.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.160
But...

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.960
If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.300
Assassins live inside.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.280
It's all a sham.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.930
Huh?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.210
A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.310
Just a photo of their faces is
worth a hundred million.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.980
Seriously?!

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.660
Damn!

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.020
I should have taken a picture of Killua!

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.940
It's just another case of rampant rumors

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.570
masking a mundane truth.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.700
Open the gate!

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.280
I-I cannot do that.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.090
The master would not be pleased.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.250
Don't worry.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.830
We're going to kill your master.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.450
Ouch...

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.830
Are you okay?

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.710
Yes, I'm fine.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.110
Man... Now Mike's going to end up
eating between meals again.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.440
Huh?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.480
Please...

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.480
He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.590
Mike!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.860
Don't blame me if you get fat!

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.140
What was that?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.370
Hey, boys!

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.880
What are you doing?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.880
Get on the bus!

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.610
You can leave.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.630
We're staying here.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.010
Huh?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.460
I see.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.150
So you're young Killua's friends.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.150
I'm happy to hear that.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.540
I've worked here for twenty years,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.370
but this is the first time

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.770
any friends have come to visit.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.000
Since I work here, I shouldn't say this,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.570
but the place is rather lonely.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.000
No one ever visits.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.560
Though we do see a lot of those...

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.080
Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.590
So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.670
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.040
Thank you.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.020
Don't mention it.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.450
However...

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.150
I cannot let you inside.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.550
Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.260
Its name is Mike.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.020
It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.170
It only obeys family,
and will attack anyone else.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.460
The beast still follows the order

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.520
its master gave it ten years ago...

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.180
To kill every single intruder.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.120
But technically, he isn't following the order.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.790
Because he keeps eating them...

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.990
Anyway, I can't let you inside.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.690
I wouldn't want to reduce young
Killua's friends to skeletons.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.200
Sir, how is it that you're safe?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.790
You go inside, correct?

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.960
If you never needed to enter,
you wouldn't have a key.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.960
Quite perceptive of you.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.460
But you're only half right.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.180
I require no key to get inside.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.720
This key is for intruders.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.720
A key for intruders?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.130
For some reason,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.200
eighty to ninety percent of intruders
attempt to use the front gate.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.870
If I don't open the gate for them,

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.520
they'll try to break it down.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.790
Such troublemakers...

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.260
So we added a locked door to one side.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.310
The intruders take the key
from the helpless guard,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.000
and then Mike eats them.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.590
A locked door...

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.260
That's it!

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.850
As you just realized, I'm not a guard.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.760
I merely clean up after Mike.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.770
And the actual gate isn't locked!

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.270
Exactly.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.730
What?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:38.120
Hunter Vocabulary

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.120
Lamentation Tours

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.970
I've tried pushing and pulling,
but it won't budge!

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.900
Are you sure it isn't locked?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.440
You just aren't strong enough.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.340
That's absurd!

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.070
I've been using all of my strength!

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.490
Just watch.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.330
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.750
Anyone who cannot open this gate

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.380
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.390
As you just saw, the door closes automatically,

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.110
so you'll want to run in, the second it opens.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.340
You don't need to worry about Mike.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.660
He has orders not to attack any who
enter through the Testing Gate.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.700
Still, this is getting tougher as I age...

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.230
But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate,

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.420
so I need to keep in shape.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.380
I should mention that each of gate
one's doors weighs two tons.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.770
Two tons?

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.380
You're not supposed to be able to open that!

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.930
Wait, what did you say?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.050
Gate one?

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.940
Yes, have a look.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.760
There are seven gates.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.230
When you go up a gate, the weight doubles.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.940
Doubles?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.700
The number of gates that open depends

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.280
on the amount of strength you use.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.210
Incidentally, when young Killua returned,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.210
he opened gates one through three.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.430
Gate three?

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.300
That would be twelve tons!

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.200
Sixteen tons, Gon.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.560
Do you understand now?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.570
This is what's required just
to get in the door.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.120
They live in a completely different world.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.730
Hmm, I don't like it.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.980
Mister, lend me the key.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.230
I came here to see my friend,
not to be tested.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.480
You can consider me an intruder.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.920
So let me borrow the key.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.260
I'll use the intruder's door.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.180
Gon!

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.490
Hey...

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.080
It doesn't matter if you
won't loan me the key.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.750
I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.750
Don't be stupid, Gon!

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.380
Didn't you see that monster?

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.080
Its arm was bigger than your entire body!

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.630
I won't accept this!

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.440
Why would you test your friends?

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.430
I'll never enter through that door.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.860
You are absolutely right.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.100
However, forcing your way
through is impossible.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.900
Mike will kill you.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.010
I agree.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.260
We have plenty of time.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.650
Let's figure out a way to
enter through gate one.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.750
It's no use.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.310
He's not gonna change his mind.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.660
Indeed...

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.720
Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.420
I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.800
Well, please wait here for a minute.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.180
Hello? This is Zebro.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.090
Three of young Killua's

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.690
friends are here to see him.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.950
Yes.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.380
Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.180
Yes, I understand. Yes.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.200
I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.380
Yep, I got in trouble.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.370
You called the mansion?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.080
No, I was speaking with the
Zoldyck family butler.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.030
All communication with the mansion
must go through the butler.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.880
It's very difficult to reach any
of the family members.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.230
Could you call him again?

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.970
I'll talk to him this time.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.240
Sure, I guess...

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.980
But you won't enjoy the experience.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.730
Yes, this is the butler's office.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.310
I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.640
Is Killua-kun there?

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.240
Killua-sama has no friends.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.740
Yes, this is the butler's office.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.650
How could you possibly know that?!

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.310
Put Killua on the phone!

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.190
I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.810
Yeah.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.480
Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens
to have a friend named Gon.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.150
There is no proof that you are Gon.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.500
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.890
By your voice?

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.570
That isn't a reliable test.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.200
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.530
That was a simple recording.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.580
And there are many other ways
to mimic a person's voice.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.960
Next, you'll claim that he'd
recognize you by sight.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.660
There are only a few methods

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.890
by which you could perfectly mimic
someone's appearance.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.110
But it still isn't impossible.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.620
Additionally, it's possible that someone
forced you to approach Killua-sama

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.350
for sinister purposes.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.850
As long as the threat exists,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.860
I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.910
The Zoldyck family practices the
trade of assassination.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.680
Naturally, it has made enemies.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.300
As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.090
from their enemies.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.920
I apologize, but please leave.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.920
Hey! Gon!

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680
Gon!

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.680
He's really pissed now.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.780
He's going to climb over the wall...

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.690
What?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.560
Hey! Stop it, Gon!

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.790
It's okay. You two can wait here.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.140
I'll go by myself.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.700
I can't let you do that!

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.720
I'll be fine!

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.700
No, you won't!

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.060
Both of you should calm down!

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.120
I'm perfectly calm!

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.270
Come down here, Gon!

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.330
Don't be stupid.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.010
Gon-kun, I'll give you the key.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.370
You can go through the door.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.960
Hold on, pops!

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.170
We can convince Gon to stop!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.300
Really?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.840
But he appears to be a stubborn boy.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.490
To make amends,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.850
I'll accompany you through the door.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.600
Huh?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.920
It's possible that Mike

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.370
may recognize me and decide not to attack.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.610
Though I'm almost a hundred percent
certain that he'll kill us all.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.270
You can't do that.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.110
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.300
No, I'm coming with you.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.370
The result will be the same if I stay behind.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.940
If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.000
I'd never be able to face him again.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.880
If you die,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.380
I will also die.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.970
I understand now.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.530
I didn't stop to consider your situation.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.890
Sorry.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.880
He's a good boy.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.990
He's willing to quell his own anger
for another person's sake.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.860
He believes in his own strength,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.510
as well as in his friends.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.410
He has a strong heart.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.410
It's likely that Mike
won't frighten him at all.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.560
You must like animals, Gon-kun.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.790
Yeah.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.340
Just as I thought.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.720
Did you grow up playing in the countryside?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.800
Yep! How did you know?

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.310
Gon-kun, I'm going to open
the Testing Gate again.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.110
I want you to see Mike for yourself.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840
Hey...

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.190
Is it really okay for us to come in?

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.790
Yes, you'll be safe because you
entered through the Testing Gate.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.260
Mike! Come here!

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.060
Gon-kun, do you understand now?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.880
This is a trained hunting dog.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.170
It's nothing like the wild animals
you're accustomed to.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.150
You must have expected to be able
to communicate with him.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.140
Until you saw his eyes.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.640
Mike is currently

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.400
memorizing the appearances and
scents of humans he's never seen.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.410
There's nothing else on his mind.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.530
He's like a machine.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.770
Gon-kun, could you fight him?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.530
No, I'm scared.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.540
I don't want to fight him!

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.540
He's such an honest boy.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.420
Well, how long will you be here?

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.210
Until we meet Killua!

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.950
We won't leave before then!

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.040
Then please come this way.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.600
The Testing Gate...

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.810
And Mike...

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.880
Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.610
lives in a completely different world.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.120
However, Gon had promised himself...

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.880
No matter what difficulties awaited him,

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.900
he would find Killua in the end.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.460
Next time: The x Guard's x Duty!

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.840
5 x 5 = 25.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.220
So you know how to do math.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.760
5 x 5 = 25!
