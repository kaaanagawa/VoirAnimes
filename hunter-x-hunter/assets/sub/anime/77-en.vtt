WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
I have a duty to fulfill...

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.190
I must give birth to the King!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.990
I am the Queen!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
Unease x And x Sighting

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.830
After using Accompany,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.040
Gon and Killua were transported
to Ging's student, Kite.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.450
After Gon remembered having
met Kite years before,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.120
he felt that Ging intended
for this meeting to occur,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.410
and his interest in Kite grew.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.190
Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.810
Biological surveying.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.810
I focus on discovering and
researching new species.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.360
Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.820
Camp Tiger?

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.950
They can use fire.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.320
They use branches that have been
ignited by lightning as live kindle.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.670
Other than certain Magical
Beasts that walk on two legs,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.150
they're the first of their kind:

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.830
animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.470
Wow, they're really cooking it.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.110
They really are using fire!

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.120
Hey, what else is there?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.840
Oh, yeah...

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.680
You said the thing that attacked
me was a Chimera Ant?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.710
Yes, a Chimera Ant.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720
Under a class-1 quarantine.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.910
Normally, no one would be allowed
near such a dangerous insect.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360
Did you discover them?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.640
No, I specialize in larger creatures.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.360
But currently, I'm investigating these insects.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.610
Something has been bothering me...

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.620
But it appears that now, I'll have
to move to a different location.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.630
I must make a call, but I'm not
getting any reception here.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.060
A call?

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.230
I'm working with others.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.130
Seven of us are working as a team.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.220
I guess I must wait for their arrival.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.410
Once they're here, I'll introduce you.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.390
They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.040
Oh?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.750
Ah, speak of the devil.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.690
Kite, who are these kids?

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.100
My friends.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.410
They dropped by for a visit on their travels.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.870
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet
you all the way out here.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.790
I'm Spinner Clow.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.230
Call me Spin!

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.200
Nice to meet you.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.210
I'm Gon Freecss.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.800
Nice to meet you, Spin.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.710
Freecss...

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.610
Wait, is this...

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.640
Yes, Ging-san's son.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.010
Really?!

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.390
And you? Not you, too?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.500
No, not me.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.150
My name is Killua Zoldyck.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.510
Zoldyck...

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.650
Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you
part of the famous family of assassins?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.400
Yeah, but I quit.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.280
Additionally, they are both pro Hunters.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.660
So you should show some respect.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.770
Wow!

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.670
Man, that was a shock!

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.960
We've been conducting biological
surveys with Kite for three years,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.330
but this is the most incredible
organism we've ever seen!

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.180
Yeah, no kidding...

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.770
I don't think we finished our introductions.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.120
I'm Monta Yuras.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.430
But call me Mon.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.190
Nice to meet you, Mon.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.320
I'm Stick Dinner.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.820
I handle the cooking.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.710
Know why?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.390
Because my name is Dinner.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.070
Nice meeting you.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.980
My name is Banana Kavaro.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.270
Good to meet you.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.740
We have two others on our team.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.330
Where are Podungo and Lin?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.590
They're both headed toward
the area of the sighting.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.880
They always move so fast.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.220
Oh, and you were right, Kite...

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.160
This looks just like the claw
of a Chimera Ant queen.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.980
We ran some computer analyses,
and the result was a 99% match.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.370
Can I see it?

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.280
Sure.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.120
This is a Chimera Ant claw?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.850
It's as big as a human finger.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.240
Does that mean there are huge ants?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.990
We don't know.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.220
Maybe one mutated and grew really big?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.710
That's possible, though it may also belong
to a completely different species.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.380
Regardless, we just don't know right now.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.980
That's why we're investigating.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.330
It all started with the wonkiest little thing...

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.260
His name was Won!

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.050
He was a Kakin official.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.380
What's Kakin?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.370
Right here.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.420
It's this wild land, in the middle
of the Azian continent.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.310
We had just completed a biological
survey they had requested when...

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.030
Magnificent.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.600
You've completed two hundred years'
worth of work for this agency...

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.690
To be honest, I regret that I am
unable to pay you a bonus.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.370
Don't say that, Won-san.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.920
We enjoyed ourselves.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.830
In lieu of that,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.430
I'll be sure to recommend you
to other friendly nations.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.300
We appreciate it.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.450
Oh, that's right!

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.330
I'm going to ramble a bit.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.440
I believe part of a very strange species was
brought to the Southern Piece auction...

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.350
There's suspicion that it's from
an unidentified organism,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.430
so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.450
but since they'd have to donate it
to a government agency otherwise,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.530
they hoped a licensed Hunter would
buy it from them for a high price.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.170
Here you are.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.660
Well, Lin?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.100
Th-This clearly belongs to an
unidentified organism, yes.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.600
F-From what I can see,
it resembles an insect's leg...

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.090
B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.930
And the claw exhibits traits
not found among insects...

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.310
A leg typically has two claws, but this has six.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.370
It almost looks as though the tarsi
evolved into something like fingers?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.880
Yes, and this part is spiny,
so it could be the tibia.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.420
If we take a sample and study
it further, we'll learn more.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.820
Could you give us a small part?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.920
Since Won-san referred you
to us, we cannot refuse.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.090
Let's look into this, then.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.770
We'll send you any results, once we have them.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.960
Appreciated.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.080
Chimera Ant...

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.790
Where did Lin and Podungo go?

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.630
Somewhere south of Yorknew City.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.410
The person who found the insect leg
apparently lives in a city by the ocean.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.800
Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath,
but we should hurry after them.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.830
Hey, can we come with you?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.780
Hmm?

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.860
Sure.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.060
Yes!

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.390
Glad to have you.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.810
Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.180
And this is Ging-san's son and
one of the Zoldyck family!

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.730
Oh, sorry...

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.120
It's no big deal.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.970
Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.580
We weren't born with the talent...

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.420
Talent, talent... Guess I have a
talent for saying "talent," huh?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.840
In this brief period of time,
they've become friends.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.340
Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.350
And also blessed with good friends.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.290
Gon might be the real deal...

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.650
He'll find you soon, Ging-san.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.550
Not enough... Not enough...

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.260
I need more, bigger food.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.110
It's been days...

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.150
No, it's been months since it last rained here.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.810
The weather is unusual this year.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.290
It's possible that this is affecting
the wildlife in some way.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.300
So the insect with the large leg

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.670
could have been a mutation
influenced by those conditions.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.790
But why would it have grown larger?

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.790
In order to survive, right?

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.680
If it's bigger, it'd have a better
chance of securing food.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.350
But that would mean it'd need more, as well.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.100
Being larger doesn't always aid survival.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.330
I believe that this is

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.310
related to the Chimera Ant's unique
nature, not to the environment.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.770
I agree.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.570
Because they reproduce in a way
not found in any other organism.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.110
What do you mean?

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.660
They reproduce through a special
process known as phagogenesis.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.950
Phagogenesis?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.660
What's that?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.280
Phagogenesis

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.590
When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.340
she is able to pass traits on

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.250
from those organisms to the next generation.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.830
And she can also eat multiple species

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.170
to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.250
With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.830
The first generation of births has
no reproductive capability,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.300
so they become worker or soldier ants.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:02.220
They work in service to the queen
and her eventual successors.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.790
Those successors are the king and
queen of the next generation.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.880
The queen is thus always looking to
consume the genes of strong organisms,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.550
so she can pass them to her offspring.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.780
And she may consume any species she
particularly likes to extinction.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.170
To extinction?!

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.050
Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.270
to consume her own weight many
times over, in a single day.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.770
That's why Chimera Ants are
under a class-1 quarantine.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.280
So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.140
Judging from the size of that claw,
her length is at least two meters.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.660
That thing could devour a human in no time.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.170
Yes, you are correct.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.050
Stay back! Go away!

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.930
B-Big Brother...

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.520
Reina, stay close to me.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.670
Take that!

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.170
It's okay now.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.330
Thank you!

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.090
You can count on your big brother.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.620
I'll always keep you safe!

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.290
Yeah!

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.450
Okay, let's go home.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.340
Hey, my brother was amazing!

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.310
There was a big snake, but he was like,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.730
"Stay back! Go away!"

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.060
Whack!

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.370
Come now, don't wave your spoon around.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.450
It's bad manners.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.500
But that's what he did.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.440
Yes, yes. I know.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.900
That was very brave.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.950
If a big snake showed up,
your mother might be too scared to move.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.980
You're truly a young man, Kurt.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.960
Yeah, I guess.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.540
You're already nine...

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.170
And a reliable big brother.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.470
You must continue to look after Reina.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.400
I'm counting on you, Kurt.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.170
I'm counting on you, Brother.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.730
Yeah, you can count on me!

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.220
I'll keep you both safe forever!

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.740
This area is about to hatch.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.610
Soldiers, hear me!

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.520
My duty is to give birth to the King.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.940
In order to give birth to a strong king,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.130
I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.270
Search out the best food you can find!

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.740
This area will also hatch soon.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.520
I require a large nest in
which to birth a strong king.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.670
I also need time to rest, free from concerns
of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.040
In order to give birth to a strong
king, I need strong soldiers.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.530
Are you okay?

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.490
Uh-huh, thank you...

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.450
Hey, Brother...

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.330
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.530
Sure.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.920
Let's wake up early tomorrow
and go fishing at the river.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.200
Yeah.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.840
We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.510
Uh-huh, I can't wait.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.220
This is enough fish for a feast.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:43.860
Yep.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.820
B-Big Brother...

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.620
Big Brother!

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.900
Reina, it's okay.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.420
I'll...

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.770
Your big brother will protect you!

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.720
I promised Mom!

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.220
I'll keep you safe!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.620
Go away...

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.480
Go away!

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.490
This is delicious,

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.640
and very nutritious...

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.490
The ultimate food.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.250
I need more of this species.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.440
They're the ones I mentioned on
the phone, Gon and Killua.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.140
Oh, I'm Lin Koshi.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.340
N-Nice to meet you.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.870
My name's Podungo Lapoy.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.890
Glad to have you on board.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.760
Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.550
Hey.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.020
Let's get down to business.
Where was the leg discovered?

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.810
On the beach over there.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.230
A-According to the locals,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.280
it washed up on sh-shore.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.210
There's a forest right behind us...

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.670
It'll be difficult to find the
Chimera Ant if it ran in there.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.070
We can't be certain that it's still alive.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.680
We don't even know if it ended up
on the same island its leg drifted to.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.720
Let's find out, then.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.690
Here, remember this scent.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.190
I'll help, too!

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.390
Huh?

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.450
His nose is as sharp as a dog's.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.110
He can't find anything...

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.890
The scent may have disappeared.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.720
It was raining.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.880
I couldn't find anything, either.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.980
That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.920
It may have washed ashore elsewhere.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.230
In which direction do the currents flow here?

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.400
It's complicated...

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.840
The direction is reversed
between day and night.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.100
And it also changes with the seasons.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.990
I've even heard it's different on certain days.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.500
So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.950
It's too early to give up.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.540
Let's split up and search.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.000
You're right.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.130
No luck...

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.020
Continuing to search blindly is pointless.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.330
Let's return to Yorknew City.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.160
We may be able to find a new lead.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.360
Her length is at least two meters.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.800
That thing could devour a human in no time.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.650
A voracious appetite...

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.680
Phagogenesis.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.950
Your Majesty...

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.450
Oh, you can speak?

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.230
So that I may fully receive,

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.820
understand, and execute your orders.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.590
That pleases me.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.720
I assign you to be a squadron leader.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.940
I am most grateful.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.470
I already have your mission.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.810
Lead all the soldiers here on a mission

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.870
to capture my food...

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.280
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.440
At once!

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.500
A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.680
Kite's worst fears have been realized.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.130
Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.070
My name is Gon Freecss.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.760
My name is Killua Zoldyck.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.880
What's your name?
