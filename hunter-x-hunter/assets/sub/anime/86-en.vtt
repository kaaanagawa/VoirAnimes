WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Kite is alive!

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.410
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.150
So we should hurry back...

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.870
Once we're stronger.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.070
To save Kite!

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.990
Promise x and x Reunion

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460
Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.790
But before they can return to NGL,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.110
they must pass the condition
set by Chairman Netero,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.470
leader of the punitive force.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.970
What are those?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.750
Tokens.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.900
You take a piece of marked wood and split it,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.980
giving each half to a different person.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.780
They work as proof that you're an ally

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.480
or to authenticate a document.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.990
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.990
In this case,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.800
each of the two assassins
holds one matching token.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.710
We defeat them and take the tokens.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.010
It's been erased.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.660
That means someone checked the board.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.020
Yeah.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.040
You must be Killua and Gon.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.400
Nice to meet you.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.780
My name is Palm.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.040
It's a pleasure.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.020
Oh, dear...

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.470
No need to be so tense.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.010
I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.440
Allow me to explain.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.290
Why don't we have some tea?

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.060
I am a student of Knov-sensei.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.420
He said I would only get in his way...

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.270
But I insisted on accompanying him.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.330
Who's that?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.250
She probably means one of the
guys with Chairman Netero.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.820
Yes, the one wearing a black suit...

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.050
My teacher is an incredible person.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.120
Cool, intelligent, composed...

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.090
Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.120
Oh, dear...

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.790
Oh, but I only respect him, that's all.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.210
There's nothing romantic about my feelings...

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.600
At least, I may wish that were the case.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.240
After all, when it comes to falling
in love, respect is a major factor.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.590
Ah, my teacher knows nothing
about this, of course.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.240
I haven't said a word to him,
and I don't intend to.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.540
No one can say what will happen...

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.750
After all, love is a spontaneous thing,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.980
don't you agree?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.080
Uh, can I interrupt you?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.660
Aren't we supposed to fight you?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.010
Huh? Oh, dear...

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.050
Yes, I apologize.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.330
The Chairman and my teacher

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.360
said I couldn't accompany them any farther.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.010
But I insisted on going with them.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.230
It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying
to convince them of my determination.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.890
And finally, they relented, with one condition.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.190
Uh, I'm asking about...

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.730
My teacher may appear a cold person,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.490
but he's actually quite gentle.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.630
But you have to spend a lot of
time with him to realize that.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.450
Ah, by "spending time with him," I don't mean—

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.630
Okay! What's the condition?!

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.210
Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.270
To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.520
will be allowed inside NGL before me...

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.640
I cannot allow that.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.360
Palm-san, turn off your <i>Hatsu</i>!

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.040
She's an Enhancer like me.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.670
I'm not too happy about that.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.460
Knuckle and Shoot?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.720
Not us?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.830
That's right.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.080
After all, I'm not the one who's
supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.000
You two are.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.000
Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.330
They, too, received a condition.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.510
I don't know what that condition was...

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.520
But whether it's us or them, only one
group will be allowed into NGL.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.020
The deadline is one month.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.720
Since we were told to keep
these tokens for a month,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.710
that means someone will come for them.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.290
What do we do, Knuckle?

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.290
That's easy.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.170
He who strikes first, wins!

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.760
Find 'em...

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.610
And kill 'em!

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.430
Certain Death

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.930
My name is Knuckle Bine!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.310
I am a Beast Hunter!

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.080
I challenge the two punitive
force candidates to a duel!

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.080
Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:08.950
Bring it on

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.750
I won't try to run or hide.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.220
I won't bring any weapons or allies.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.300
It'll just be me and me alone.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.990
So come and fight me!

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.830
But where?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.580
The location?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.580
You have to tell them where to find you.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:29.840
Bring it on

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.430
A man never turns his back on an enemy.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.090
I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.460
You won't get away!

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.840
Even if he said where, I wouldn't go.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.390
He's just a decoy.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.720
His partner's probably hidden
somewhere, watching.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.240
They're watching to see if
anyone reacts suspiciously.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.170
According to Palm, they don't
even know our names.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.110
Yeah.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.150
So their goal must be to smoke us out.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.020
No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.740
Did he look strong?

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.750
He's pretty strong.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.400
What will it take to defeat him?

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.250
I have no idea!

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.990
One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.670
In a <i>Nen</i> battle, nothing is certain.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.320
So, according to him,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.620
it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.960
I disagree.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.420
If you want to survive, you must
increase your odds of victory.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.780
Gauging the strength differential between
you and an opponent is crucial.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.070
If you're up against someone you can only beat

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.820
once or twice out of a
hundred times, don't bother.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.660
You need at least a fifty-percent chance.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.800
If possible, greater than
seventy percent is preferable.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.920
To reach that, we must do two things...

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.890
Work on our fundamentals, and learn
more about our opponents' abilities.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.800
Right.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.930
If we know our opponents' abilities,
it'll be easier to plan ahead.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.420
Like we did against Genthru.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.440
I'm half agreed, and half opposed.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.690
What do you mean?

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.700
I think we should work on our fundamentals,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.950
but I don't think we need to know their abilities.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.400
Huh? Why not?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.820
That just increases our risk of defeat.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.450
Nothing good can come of that!

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.960
But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.730
Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.260
It's to become stronger,
and return to NGL and save Kite.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.730
In other words,

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.270
we must be strong enough to defeat
enemies we know nothing about.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.920
Winning here with advance
preparation is pointless.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.150
That's true,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.860
but we have to defeat these opponents first.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.010
After all, we only have a month.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.160
That's too long.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.450
One week.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.290
In one week, we'll be stronger,
and heading back to NGL!

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.490
Go—

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.750
Are you an idiot?!

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.040
Bisky!

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.910
Why are you here?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.010
I asked her to come.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.420
Huh? You know each other?

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.290
No, I looked into your backgrounds.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.490
How?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.900
We only know Bisky because...

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.000
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.430
Now, there's no time to spare.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.400
Let's begin...

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.300
The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.740
Um, no.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.600
Let's get started, then.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.420
Osu!

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.490
What was that for?!

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.940
I'm picking up where I left off.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.300
Are you stupid?

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.430
That old man's famous for his nasty nature.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.900
If he tells you to do something in a month,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.670
it probably should take an entire year.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.190
You won't defeat them after a week!

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.180
But we have to hurry back and save Kite.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.070
What are you talking about?

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.790
That was fun...

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.720
Like a dream come true.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.510
I'd love to fight you...

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.950
once more.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.570
I see...

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.180
All the more reason you shouldn't
return without proper training!

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.060
What if you make the same mistake again?!

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.940
So typical of her age.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.990
She's always ready with a lecture.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.990
Got it?

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.540
Osu...

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.640
Let's start training, then.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.210
Begin with <i>Ren</i>!

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.630
Maintain that for three hours.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.120
Killua, how long can you last?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.890
In top condition, I can manage
around fifty-five minutes, max.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.770
Until you complete this,
we can't move to the next step.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.190
Train like your lives are on the line!

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.820
Come on.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.120
You didn't even last an hour.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.290
Okay, keep working.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.060
They say it takes a month to add ten
minutes to your <i>Ren</i> endurance.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.050
You won't have time to sleep.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.810
Curses...

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.050
Those damn cowards ran away!

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.440
You bastards deserve to die now!

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.470
You have a collar.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.440
Where's your owner?

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.590
You're supposed to keep the park clean.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.840
Okay, you can rest for today!

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.460
Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.540
Looks like it's time for me to use my power.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.500
Take it away, Cookie-chan.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.650
Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.760
Pink Relief

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.620
Excuse me...

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.470
I hope this won't offend you,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.180
but I'll let you decide how to train them.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.020
Since my power told me that
you would be the answer.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.050
However,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:46.400
if they cannot defeat Morel's
disciples after one month,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.000
I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.610
I absolutely must go to NGL.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.840
Honestly, I want to depart this moment.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.040
So after I've waited and waited
and waited and waited and waited,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.550
if this fails now,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.800
I'll probably kill all of you...

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.310
Was that a threat?

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.780
No, it's a warning.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.220
I'm worried about you all.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.310
So if you think they have no chance,
I recommend that you leave...

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:23.730
Speaking from experience, I'm less
likely to lose my temper that way.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.350
I'm not the one you should tell.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.820
Once they're awake, tell the boys.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.340
Don't worry! We've got this!

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.580
You can count on us to get you to NGL.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.750
So let us know if you notice anything.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.120
We'll do our best.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.670
That's how they are.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.100
Have some faith.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.400
Oh, dear!

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.490
This won't do at all...

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.430
Anyway, I'm more concerned about
what's happening inside NGL.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.140
What is the Chairman's group
doing for the next month?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.740
Well?!

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.250
Ah, well...

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.450
They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.250
Identifying the enemy's strengths,
and weakening their forces...

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.200
The experts can't agree on the amount of time

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.870
remaining before the King's birth.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.270
The Chairman is operating with two months,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.290
the earliest prediction, as the deadline.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.230
This is bad.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.530
That thing is stronger than I am.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.800
Stronger than the Chairman?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.410
Surely you jest.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.420
If that's really true,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.640
none of the Hunters will be able to fight it.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:04.270
It's been more than half a century since
I was the strongest among <i>Nen</i> users.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.050
Now, I'm more or less even with you guys.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.010
Then you're more than strong enough.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.620
You should have more confidence.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.010
Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.170
Growing old is no fun.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.180
He never stops talking.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.810
But we must fight.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.470
I would prefer to avoid it...

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.310
If there were a solution that would
avoid a fight, I'd choose it.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.260
Our target is the Queen,
and the Queen alone.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.960
But sneaking past the surveillance of
that <i>En</i> will be next to impossible.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.530
We cannot avoid a fight...

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.980
The question is how we will manage to win.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.590
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.540
You're simply awful.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.670
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.450
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.050
Yeah, let's take it slow.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.260
Might as well enjoy the job...

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.270
Okay...

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.070
First, we should learn the enemy's numbers.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.440
Go.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.300
So many.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.290
Something is coming.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.580
They aren't alive...

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.070
Is this the enemy's power?

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.210
Now, what to do?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.420
You may as well wait.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.720
If they come here, we simply destroy them.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.450
You have a point.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.430
These could be decoys.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.760
Huh, what?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.730
Was I speaking aloud?

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.150
No.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.480
I simply knew what you were thinking.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.980
Who are you, anyway?

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.000
One of the Queen's Royal Guard.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.460
Shaiapouf.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.500
Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.780
Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.380
Yes, that is correct.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.410
You can read all my thoughts.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.720
Not sure I like that.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.720
Well, I can understand the sentiment.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.330
But...

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.050
He will wake soon.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.650
That's good news!

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:20.020
You see, I haven't been able to
decide what power to develop.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.720
Right, it's so simple.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.700
I merely need to fix him.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.710
I only need the power to do that.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.930
And then, I will be able to experience
that dreamlike moment with you

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.390
once more...

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.950
Come on, what are you doing?

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.120
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.160
Are you giving up on going to NGL?

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.130
N-No way...

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.660
We never give up.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.110
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.890
To save Kite...

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.970
After reuniting with Bisky,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.380
Gon and Killua are back to training.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.500
They have one goal:

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.500
to get strong enough to save Kite.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.780
Right now, that motivation is driving Gon.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.050
Next time: Duel x and x Escape.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.170
It's on, Killua!

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.490
It's on, Gon!

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.800
Rock, paper... Rock!

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.680
I lost...
