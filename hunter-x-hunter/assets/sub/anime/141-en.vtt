00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.230
Wow!

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:13.110
You'll find footage of today's entire meeting—
the <i>entire</i> meeting—on the Hunter site,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.750
so tell everyone who wasn't present!

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Magician x And x Butler

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.510
I will announce the results of the fourth vote
for the election of the 13th chairman.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.850
Out of 661 Hunters,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.350
there were 642 valid votes

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.480
and 19 absentees.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.440

25) Hanzo, 5 others — 2
28) Saiyu, 8 others — 1

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.550
The turnout was 97.1%.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.990
4th Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 258 (39%)
2) Cheadle — 57
3) Leorio — 55
4) Botobai — 31
5) Mizaistom — 27

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.910
As the conditions were not met,
the vote must be redone.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.750 position:20% line:50%
1) Pariston
2) Cheadle
3) Leorio
4) Botobai

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.020
Voter turnout for the most recent vote in
the 13th chairman election exceeded 95%.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.570
Which means that for the fifth vote,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.120
we will have a runoff with the top sixteen
candidates, so keep that in mind.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.730
I will now introduce the top sixteen
candidates in the order of votes received.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.660
Please use this information when voting.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.320
Pariston Hill, a Triple Star Hunter.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.720
The current Association vice chairman,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.030
The brains of the Zodiacs, she keeps the

Leorio Paradinight, a rookie.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.710
A rising star after punching Ging,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.540
he's currently studying to become a doctor.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.670
Botobai Gigante, a Triple Star Hunter.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.540
Advisor to the Zodiacs,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.550
he was the closest to the chairman
in both reputation and reality.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.340
Mizaistom Nana, a Double Star Crime Hunter.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.710
The conscience of the Zodiacs,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.060
his practical nature has earned the respect
of the anti-chairman faction.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.420
Ickshonpe Katocha, a Single Star Hacker Hunter.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.570
Living in the digital world, he has
yet to cast any votes himself.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.520
Teradein Neutral, a Double Star Headhunter.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.620
Specializing in discovering talent,
he seeks to reform the Hunter Exam.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.190
Morel Mackernasey, a Single Star Sea Hunter.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.320
After defeating the Ants,
will he jump to Triple Star?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.590
His focus is preparation for the
arrival of more alien species.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.670
Saccho Kobayakawa, a Double
Star Counseling Hunter.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.530
Counselor of the Zodiacs,

he seeks to reform the Association
from behind the scenes.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.310
Biscuit Krueger, a Double Star Gemstone Hunter.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.040
The Association's mother figure...

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.890
Sorry, older sister.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.780
More and more people want her to scold them.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.800
Sanbica Norton, a Single Star Virus Hunter.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.240
The Association's doctor,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.330
she has asked that no one vote for her.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.290
Linne Hors-d'oeuvre, a Double Star Gourmet Hunter.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.280
The oldest Association Hunter,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.750
it's been five years since anyone
has heard her speak.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.050
Bushidora Ambitious, a Single Star Blacklist Hunter.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.350
The Association's disciplinary officer,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.810
he advocates amending the Ten Commandments.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.280
Loupe Highland, a Lost Hunter.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.180
He can find anything from missing
contacts to missing persons.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.520
He's tackling the issue of missing Hunters.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.540
Cutie Beauty, a Single Star Cutiful Hunter.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.890
Recognized as the leader of
the Vice Chairman's fan club.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.580
She seeks to create a cutiful Association.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.970
Ging Freecss, a Double Star
Archaeological Hunter.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.050
The vagabond of the Zodiacs.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.880
Is he back in the election
after receiving pity votes?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.590
Leorio's in third?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.430
That's incredible.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.930
You can go to hell!

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.870
I guess this clip had a big impact...

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.630
And he has no problem using
his <i>Nen</i> in front of a crowd.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
You can go to hell!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.050
Looks like he's an Emitter.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.580
So do people dislike Gon's dad?

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.700
That was a standing ovation.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.360
Wow!

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.960
You'll find footage of today's entire meeting...

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.470
Master Illumi...

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.300
Yes, at once.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.050
Please wait one moment.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.990
Thanks to Gotoh,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.240
I can see it now...

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.300
Our family's correlation chart surrounding Alluka.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.660
Despite what he says, my father trusts me.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.660
That's why Gotoh was allowed to accompany us,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.740
and he won't force me to stop.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.300
However, he's wary of Alluka's power.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.120
Which makes sense, given that one wrong move

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.050
is all it takes for the entire family to die.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.530
But on the other hand,
he wishes to control Alluka's power.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.790
That dilemma shows in his decision to
lock her up in a room filled with toys.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.300
That's why he had Tsubone and Amane,
his most trusted butlers, accompany us.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.150
If something happens, they can
take us back immediately.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.930
And he hopes they'll glean some hint
to help him control Alluka.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.080
Tsubone and Amane understand their role,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.530
and they're being very cautious.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.090
Gotoh and Canary are being subtle,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.750
but they're on our side and helping us.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.020
And then,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.400
there's Illumi.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.380
The moment his name was spoken,
Amane's tension spiked.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.310
This means Amane and Tsubone,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.230
and Father and Grandpa by extension,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.920
disagree with Illumi.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.520
I'd guess that Illumi's plans for Alluka are...

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.800
That was a fine play, Gotoh.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.940
You threw out his name to see Amane's reaction.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.600
If Tsubone were here,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.180
she would have noticed Gotoh's reaction
when he answered the phone,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.430
and she'd have distracted me or signaled
Amane to shut off her emotions.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.830
This is an internal family struggle,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.080
an inner mission.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.610
When family members differ
in opinion or objective,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.930
they're each encouraged to do things their
own way, rather than unite in the same goal.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.590
This is a contest!

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.790
Father and Grandpa want Alluka
near, so they can control her,

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.980
and they don't want me hurt by her power.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.020
I want

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.800
to save Gon

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.780
and to set Alluka free.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.000
And...

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.560
Illumi wants

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.930
to kill Alluka!

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.130
Is this Killua?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.750
Yeah.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.270
You removed the needle, didn't you?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.430
Yeah.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.350
I feel a lot better.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.770
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.240
Kill?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.060
Me?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.400
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.930
<i>Family</i> is off limits.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.120
Hey, hey, Amane...

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.310
Isn't this part great?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.050
Why is this story so mysterious?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.730
Is that what

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.570
Father meant?

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.030
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.190
They're all thinking

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.490
the same thing!

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.050
Fine...

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.940
I'll beat you at your own game.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.630
Then, let's begin.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.290
Master Killua!

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.720
Don't let go of Master Alluka!

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.670
Yeah, I got her.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.080
If you two are more than a meter apart,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.290
Amane will capture Master Alluka,

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.430
and Tsubone will take you home by force!

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.980
Oh, dear.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.990
That was excessive.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.750
I thought you were going to ask him first.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.150
I have a little bird who brings me information.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.180
And after examining that information,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.970
there's something that bothers me.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.290
Killua is hiding rules from us.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.750
If there are rules I don't know about,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.990
trying to negotiate with him is pointless.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.180
He might accede to my demands
because they favor him.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.070
So I'll dispose of Alluka before he has
a chance to use that advantage.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.230
I just need you to eliminate the butlers

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.580
while you look for a chance
to take Alluka from Killua.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.200
For now.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.340
Okay.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.600
By the way,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.840
am I allowed to kill Killua?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.240
I will

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.810
kill you.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.150
Right here.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.930
Right now.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.530
I was kidding.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.520
You're oozing bloodlust.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.490
Is that all right?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.780
Illumi's bloodlust!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.140
Oh, damn.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.300
Was that on purpose?

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.890
Certainly not.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.430
If at all possible, I'd like Gon to live.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.960
Having more toys is always more amusing.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.380
Well,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.980
only if it's possible.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.960
It's okay. Brother's got you.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.580
Keep your eyes closed and hold on tight.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.840
Uh-huh.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.590
Try to stay away from Master Illumi.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.840
If he knows the route we're taking,
it's best to change directions.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.350
I concur, but...

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.430
It's hard for me to agree with you.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.710
My grandmother and I are not your enemies.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.610
Not right now.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.620
But that could change if my
father's mood changes.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.790
Master Silva and Master Zeno
are not your enemies.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.630
Our mission is to bring you home safely.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.490
If that doesn't include Alluka,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.640
you're all enemies.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.630
Godspeed!

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.590
Speed of Lightning!

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.870
It's me. The situation's changed.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.980
We've been separated from Master Killua.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.130
We'll need four vehicles now.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.820
We'll follow the same route.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.120
If Master Killua contacts you,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.040
follow his instructions, but avoid
any sensitive information.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.670
Master Illumi is aware of our movements.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.170
One of the butlers or a family
member is helping him.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.620
Be sure to stay alert.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.800
Understood.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.860
Ah...

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.460
You've grown, Master.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.690
If I hadn't known about that
technique beforehand,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.210
I wouldn't have had time to react.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.160
He will become an excellent assassin.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.140
Oh, dear. These days, it doesn't
take much for me to tear up.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.230
In that case, he won't let Master
Illumi get the better of him.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.910
I shouldn't say that.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.300
But I find it difficult to like Master Illumi

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.480
and Master Milluki, who resemble their mother.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.200
Now, then...

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.760
Time to set aside personal emotion.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.490
If he breaks the rules, everything changes.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.510
I need to devise a way to subdue Master Killua,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.550
taking his speed into account.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.050
Okay! We should be far enough
away to take a break.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.860
I'd like to use Speed of Lightning to keep going,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.640
but to be safe, I should save my
energy for getting into town.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.770
Brother?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.190
Am I a nuisance?

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.790
If I were gone, would everyone get along better?

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.180
Alluka.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.300
If...

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.410
I were the only person in the
world who really loved you,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.820
would you be sad?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.550
I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.760
Okay?

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.370
I'll always be with you!

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.000
You don't need to worry about anyone else.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.310
Someone's there.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.870
Is it Tsubone?

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.460
Is it Illumi?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.100
I guess this won't be easy.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.370
That's fine!

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.270
Let's go.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.160
Who are you?

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.130
A magician who wishes to stay anonymous.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.920
You two

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.380
shouldn't be trying to fight back.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.090
Just evade his attacks.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.210
Save your energy for the mission at hand.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.040
You should follow Master Killua.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.470
I'll play with you.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.730
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.990
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.300
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.350
He must have used his power.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:28.020
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.520
Elastic Love
Bungee Gum

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.640
You've said too much.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.280
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.250
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.530
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.610
Hisoka and Gotoh

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.470
are about to engage in battle.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.090
A barrage of coins.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.460
A net of gum.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.140
While a furious battle takes place,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.760
Illumi pursues the fleeing Killua.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.090
Next time: Needles x And x Debt.
