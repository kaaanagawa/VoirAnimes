WEBVTT

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.040
In the Dentora region

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.510
of the Republic of Padokea,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.300
Kukuroo Mountain.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.670
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.010
Lamentation Tours

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.570
I have a message for you from Kil...

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.280
"Thank you for coming.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.960
I really appreciate it.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120
But I can't see you right now.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.400
Sorry."

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.950
The x Zoldyck x Family

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.230
Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio have advanced

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.910
a little closer to the mansion.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.330
Meanwhile...

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.390
I'm home.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.850
Well, no one's around.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.850
Welcome back.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.600
How did work go?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.450
Fine.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.110
Does that mean you dispatched your target?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.940
I'm sure you were watching me
from a distance.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.020
Mom's waiting for you inside.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.990
I don't want to see her.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.750
Ah.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.960
Did you need something?

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.250
I wanted to say hello.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.170
Are you new here?

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.810
Yes.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.810
While you were away,
I was hired as an apprentice butler.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.180
My name is Canary.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.290
Here. You can have this.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.380
No, thank you.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.920
But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.690
Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.720
I cannot do that.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.710
I am a servant.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.790
And you are my employer.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.260
Tsk... That's lame.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.340
You were using the Shadow Step, right?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.330
Shadow Step?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.340
The technique where you move silently,
so you won't be noticed.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.210
It's one of the first assassination
techniques we learn

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.090
in the Zoldyck family.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.140
Is that so?

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.970
I must have learned it while
growing up in Meteor City.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.480
Meteor City?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.860
My hometown.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.030
It's a city that has been erased from this world.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.430
Huh, never heard of it.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.060
You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.440
That's why many members

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.600
of the mafia and the Phantom
Troupe come from there.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.040
I'd like to visit some time.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.430
When you visit, I can serve as your guide.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.930
I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.890
Rhythm Echo?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.190
It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.450
You move at a certain rhythm,
creating afterimages.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.410
I see...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.070
It appears we have intruders.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.640
Many intruders.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.090
Let Mike handle it.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.710
The master has ordered that
Mike be restrained today.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.720
They wish to test my abilities.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.840
We'll split up and look for their mansion.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.280
Leave.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.780
Who are you?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.250
There is no need for me to answer that question.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.100
You are trespassing on private property.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.790
I cannot allow you to pass without permission.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.790
Can you stop us?

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
It's obvious that you stand no chance.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.050
Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.880
If you take one step past this line,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.800
I shall use force to remove you.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.560
What was that?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.060
You can stand back and watch, boss...

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.440
We'll take care of this.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.650
Let's go!

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.150
Don't mock us!

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.040
Bitch!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.210
Get her!

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.820
Do you wish to continue?

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.540
After all that, she hasn't
even broken a sweat...

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.200
Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.510
Hardly.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.970
I am but an apprentice butler.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.120
With your abilities,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.420
you're not even a match for the butlers,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.880
let alone the Zoldyck family.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.350
A futile effort...

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.430
I'm telling you that it's useless!

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.090
As a Hunter,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.970
I cannot allow a little girl
like you to defeat me.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.560
Prepare yourself!

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.060
What?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.490
Die!

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.510
I-I'm sorry!

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.460
Please spare my life!

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.510
Zebro-san...

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.110
You noticed my presence?

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.680
Could you clean this up?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.770
Sure, that's my job.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.830
Plus, Mike is starving.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.710
Huh?

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.030
H-Help!

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.720
You already knew the Rhythm Echo.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.550
Yes... Forgive me.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.800
You think you're stronger than I am.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.020
Absolutely not.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.250
Really?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.240
So, I don't have anyone to play with.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.310
Will you be my friend, Canary?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.650
I apologize, Killua-sama.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.550
Tsk. Lame...

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.220
Let's be friends!

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.570
Gon...

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:18.160
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.160
Canary

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.930
Is she okay?

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.170
Yeah.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.260
She's only unconscious.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.050
Wake up!

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.430
Oh. Morning, Bro.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.190
What time is it?

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.690
Don't be too arrogant, Kil!

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.410
What?

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.250
I feel really bad about stabbing you, Bro.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.200
Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.240
You're lying!

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.920
You can tell?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.970
Tsk!

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.840
Hello?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.650
Oh, Mama?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.680
Uh-huh.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.500
Yep, I understand.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.080
Kil,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.190
your friends are near the butler's office.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.310
How about it, Kil?

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.570
If I ask Mama, those three can become...

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.360
Milluki.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.420
If you so much as touch them, I'll kill you.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.580
Forgive me for not introducing myself.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.860
I am Killua's mother.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.300
This is Kalluto.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.180
Why can't Killua come see us?

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.680
Because he's in solitary confinement.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.050
Solitary confinement?

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.910
Kil stabbed me and his brother
before he ran away from home.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.110
That is the story he told us.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:23.360
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.620
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.250
So we do not know when he will leave...

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.130
What? Father! What are you doing?!

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.120
Don't do anything hasty!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.130
He's finally returned!

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.360
I'm coming in.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.200
One Kill Per Day

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.650
That's enough, Mil.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.610
But, Grandpa Zeno...

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.080
He isn't sorry at all.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.530
I know that.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.060
Kil, you can go.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.410
Okay.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.910
Man, that hurt.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.340
Bro, I'm not sorry.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.780
But I do feel bad.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.300
So I let you slap me around.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.620
What was that?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.850
Kil, Silva wants to see you.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.730
Dad?

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.050
Okay.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.230
Damn it!

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.530
You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.060
That's why he's such an uppity brat...

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.830
He's special.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.600
Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.410
It's incredible, sure.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.280
He's probably the most talented
Zoldyck in history?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.270
Mama seems to think so.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.020
I have to agree.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.140
Considerable praise.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.190
But he fails as an assassin

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.790
because he's so moody.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.060
Moody?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.900
A kid who wants to make friends
can't lead the Zoldyck family.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.220
In the end, he's just a crybaby.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.060
Mentally weak.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.380
That is true...

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.600
Right? Take me.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.730
I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.990
Oh, that's right.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.390
The bomb I'll use next time
is awesome, Grandpa!

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.840
It's super-compact.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.310
I attached it to a female mosquito,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.600
and it's triggered to explode when the
mosquito sucks the target's blood.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.760
But the problem is getting the mosquito
to recognize the target...

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.810
Mil...

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.190
You're a bright boy,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.030
but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.760
Oh, why must Father be this way?

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.060
Something has come up.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.200
So I bid you farewell.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.950
Please wait!

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.460
We'll be staying in town for a while.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.960
Please let Killua know.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.630
Very well. I shall tell him.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.710
Goodbye.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.220
Who are you?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.600
Killua's friends.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.000
Friends...

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.800
Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.980
Come over here!

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.650
Yes, Mother.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.780
I probably shouldn't say it,
but these people creep me out...

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.780
And I bet they were lying about Killua's
saying that he can't see us.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.870
Gon, we can't go back yet.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.660
How about we tail them?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.170
Sure, but if we do that,

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.800
she'll take the blame.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.700
Oh, right...

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.870
I will take you to the butler's office.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.490
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.270
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.010
Zeno-sama?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.760
Killua-sama's grandfather.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.390
Kil.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.510
I heard that you've made some friends?

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.790
Yeah.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.320
What sort of people are they?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.600
What sort of...?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.300
They're people I enjoy being with.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.870
I see.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.470
How was the Exam?

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.860
It was easy.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.120
Kil, come over here.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.810
Huh?

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.440
I want you to tell me more.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.090
What did you do during the Exam?

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.640
Who did you meet? How did you feel?

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.060
You can tell me anything...

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.330
Okay.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.280
I can't believe this.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.510
Father didn't even ask me first.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.340
Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa...

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.350
I won't forgive them!

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.560
And guess what Gon said next...

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.370
He didn't want his legs cut off,

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.590
but he didn't want to surrender, either!

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.540
He's so self-centered.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.070
Sounds like an interesting boy.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.390
And then his opponent

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.980
pointed a blade at Gon's forehead,
but Gon still...

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.940
Kil.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.740
Huh?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.530
Do you want to see your friends?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.720
You don't need to hold back.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.140
Tell me the truth.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.850
Thinking back,

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.490
we've never had a father-son chat before.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.430
I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.080
And I raised you the same way.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.760
You and I are different.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.680
I didn't realize that until you left home.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.590
You are my son.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.580
But you are your own person.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.720
Live as you please.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.960
If you get tired, you can come home.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.840
I'll ask you one more time.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.310
Do you want to see your friends?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.340
Uh-huh.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.420
I understand.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.770
You're free now.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.270
But...

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.360
Promise me one thing.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.700
Never betray your friends.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.680
Understand?

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.830
I promise.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.870
I'll never betray them.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.760
Never.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.140
Kil.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.020
It's too late. Those three left.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.610
Return to your cell.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.130
No way. I'm leaving.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.800
Kil!

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.150
Out of my way.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.240
Oh, Kil...

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.150
Your eyes are so cold now...

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.050
What were you thinking?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.210
Kil was finally home!

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.420
For now, we'll let him do what he wants.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.830
No! What are you saying?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.020
This is a critical juncture in the process

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.300
of determining if he's qualified
to lead the family!

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.280
So you understand what's at stake.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.300
Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.810
He'll come home one day.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.500
Because he is my son.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.520
Killua has been set free.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.830
But Silva declares that Killua
will return as an assassin.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.590
Meanwhile, Gon and his friends
head to the butler's office.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.030
Will they be able to see Killua?

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.300
Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.340
Eye for an eye.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.680
Eye for a tooth?

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.350
Tooth for a tooth!
