00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440
<i>Ten</i>.

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.790
The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.830
<i>Zetsu</i>.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.190
A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.000 line:20%

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.110
<i>Ren</i>.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.260
A technique to create an
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.510 line:20%
Act

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.160
<i>Hatsu</i>.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.200
The release of your <i>Nen</i> aura,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.510
after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.020 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.270
Oh...

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.520
Don't look at me like that.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.030
Schwing

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.030
I'm getting turned on.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.030
A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.170
Gon was able to land a solid
punch to Hisoka's face.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.440
Will he be able to win the match?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.300
Critical!

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.670
Two points for Gon!

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.180
Amazing! Gon managed
to land a critical hit!

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.590
He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.310
Gon is on top!

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.450
However,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.320
it appears that his punch hasn't
dealt much damage to Hisoka.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.570
I have to question the referee's decision...

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.580
The referee is entitled to award
points as he pleases.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.660
Huh?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.440
Some referees award points based
on the amount of damage done,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.380
while some base scores on
strategy and technique.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.250
I believe the referee in this case
was rewarding the fighter for

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.340
using the stone block in his attack.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.190
I see...

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.420
So, who are you?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.600
Okay!

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.490
O-Oh...

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.060
For the first time in this fight,
Hisoka has moved!

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.760
And he's smiling ever so slightly.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.250
Is he finally getting serious?

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.260
What was that about?!

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.530
I have no idea!

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.170
How much have you learned

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.050
about <i>Nen</i>?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.050
All of the basics.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.540
I see.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.520
You must be an Enhancer.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.210
H-How did you know?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.220
You're so adorable...

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.070
You should do a better job
of keeping a secret.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.390
Shut up!

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.070
How did you know?

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.290
I used a method similar to the
blood type personality test.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.240
And it's just as unreliable.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.580
I devised my own way of using
personality to classify aura.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.030
Enhancers are simple and earnest.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.710
He nailed it.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.460
He's right.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.520
By the way, I'm a Transmuter,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.210
fickle and dishonest.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.470
It fits.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.590
He nailed it.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.970
Emitters have short tempers.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.650
Specialists are independent.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.940
Conjurers are high-strung.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.860
Manipulators are argumentative.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.300
The two of us are quite compatible.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.040
Our opposing personalities attract.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.860
We could become very intimate.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.240
But you should take care,
because Transmuters are fickle.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.750
It takes a mere second for
treasure to turn to trash.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.510
So...

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.010
Do not disappoint me, Gon.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.440
He's fast!

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.180
Wh-What a strong kick.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.590
He sent that stone block flying
all the way to the entrance!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.180
Fast, fast, fast!

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.810
Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.960
Critical for Hisoka!

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.130
Add points.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.260
3-2!

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.840
His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.460
as a critical strike.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.770
He's regained the lead.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.820
Gon appears to be confused...

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.360
Does he have no way to fight back?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.270
He's backing off.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.870
Amazing...

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.280
Too amazing.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.580
What's wrong?

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.230
Attack me.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.540
Forget it.
I'm brainstorming!

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.300
I can just barely follow him by eye,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.320
but the rest of my body can't keep up.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.050
At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.970
Very well.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.310
Then I'll have to force you
to come over here...

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.560
Gon, use <i>Gyo</i> !

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.070
Crap!

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.700
Do you understand

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.080
what is happening?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.180
Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.120
This is my Elastic Love...

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.250
Also known as Bungee Gum.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.260
It can expand and contract.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.010
And attach and detach as I desire...

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.980
You won't be able to escape.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.980
Critical and down.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.860
Plus three points to Hisoka.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.080
6-2!

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.910
Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.330
Gon is down!

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.110
He turns his aura into a rubbery substance

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.090
capable of attaching to other objects.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.590
Bungee Gum.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.850
Tsk.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.340
Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.350
Stand up, Gon...

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.600
Damn.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.330
The score is 6-2.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.580
Hisoka increases his lead.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.360
Will his undefeated record continue?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.780
Stand up, kid!

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.240
Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.270
You can do it!

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.400
Can you fight?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.640
Of course.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.310
Oh, Gon is standing...

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.270
But he's sustained significant damage!

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.580
Okay, I have a question for you.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.090
Huh?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.090
If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.340
What?

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.850
When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.190
When did he attach his Gum?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600
One...

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.600
When I elbowed you.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.830
Two...

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.710
When I landed a clean hit.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.330
Three...

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.110
When I landed a critical strike?

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.610
When was it?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.370
Three! When you hit me with both hands!

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.490
Wrong!

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.870
The answer is four.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.210
When I was giving you my
aura personality analysis.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.380
That's dirty!

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.890
Damn.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.140
If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.510
Now, I have a warning for you.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.900
Had you been using <i>Gyo</i>,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.010
you would have been able to notice my aura,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.020
and you could have avoided it

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.410
during my aura personality analysis.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.160
However, what about situations
one, two, and three?

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.100
Have you figured it out?

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.650
I could have also attached my Bungee Gum

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.170
while directly attacking you.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.540
You only need to conceal your aura when you
wish to catch your opponent off guard.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.810
Normally, you use your aura while attacking.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.240
It doesn't matter if your
opponent sees your aura

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.940
when you're landing attacks.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.950
He's right.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.350
If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks,

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.630
using Gyo to see his aura won't help!

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.290
This is bad.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.450
His power's far more difficult to
handle than I expected!

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.260
So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.170
if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.710
But if you're able to defend...

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.310
No, defending won't work.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.470
Even if you block, he can still attach
his aura to the part you block with.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.240
I can't escape.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.810
What should I do?

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.050
Okay, that's enough talk.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.980
Let us prepare for battle.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.990
Resume.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.990
If I can't escape,

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.750
I'll go to him!

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.250
Gon...

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.880
Gon!

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.190
Good...

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.510
You're so good.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.010
Those eyes.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.770
That look.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.020
That spirit...

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.280
I can't wait

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.030
to break you.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.540
But not yet...

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.490
More...

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.800
More!

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.930
Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.050
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.810
Once you've matured...

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.520
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.520
Until you've reached soaring new heights...

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.730
I must wait.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.010
A vicious rush!

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.900
Oh, not again!

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.250
Hisoka draws Gon into another
punch from his left fist!

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.510
Good.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.280
I managed to block that!

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.690
I'm getting used to being dragged
around by his Bungee Gum.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.180
This isn't over.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.560
It's not over yet!

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.130
I'm scared...

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.770
But if I let my fear overcome me,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.740
I'll never be able to beat anyone else!

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.710
Critical for both sides!

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.990
Plus two points!

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.980
Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.740
What?

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.750
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.200
I was never knocked down!

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.170
I got right back up!

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.250
I even blocked his attack!

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.240
What?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.810
Something's wrong with this ref!

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.000
Are you blind?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.900
Oh, we have another strange call.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.340
In response to the ref's decision,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.620
the crowd has filled the arena with boos.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.210
Fight!

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.340
If he gets ten points, I lose.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.770
I only have one point left.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.280
He doesn't need to knock me down.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.530
If I get hit by any attack, it's over!

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.280
You must be more vigilant, Gon.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.160
Look to the right.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.700
Oh, sorry.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.080
I meant my right.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.390
Down, and clean hit!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.220
Plus two points.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.390
11-4.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.400
The winner, by, TKO, is...

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.200
Hisoka!

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.130
Huh?

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.290
While you were complaining to the referee,

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.130
I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.130
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.930
Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.810
So...

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.890
It's really over?

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.240
You've made incredible progress.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.180
But you lack experience.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.250
About ten more fights, and you
should stand a better chance.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.750
If we're in Heavens Arena, at least.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.510
Therefore,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.570
I will not fight you here again.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.510
Next time,

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.510
we'll fight in the real world,
without any rules to restrain us.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.520
With our lives on the line.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.030
He's so far away...

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.950
But he's not out of reach.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.820
I need more training in Nen...

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.040
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.070
With this victory, Hisoka has
earned his tenth win

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.330
and the right to challenge a Floor Master!

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.310
Gon has fought bravely, and we wish
him the best in his next match.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.420
So that's all for now.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.320
This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.720
A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.450
But given today's matchup,

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.060
I thought it prudent

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.040
to end the fight as quickly as possible,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.200
even if it meant lowering my standards.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.260
So he's a technical ref.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.570
What does that mean?

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.370
If a ref believes that a
fight may get dangerous,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.220
he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.690
You have to take that into
consideration when placing a bet.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:25.230
Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0...

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.500
I have nothing to say to you
about the fight with Hisoka.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.990
You were the one fighting him,
so I'm sure you understand best of all.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.990
Understand what?

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.000
What he learned from that fight.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.390
Yes!

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.610
Gon, what did you learn?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.540
A secret.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.500
Gon-kun, Killua-kun...

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.290
You will need to master
your own styles of <i>Nen</i>,

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.260
as you continue down your chosen paths.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.580
Yes!

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.660
Yeah.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.750
I'm glad I was able to meet you.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.650
You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.160
You think you can pass us?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.610
One day, for sure!

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.720
Won't happen.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.680
I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.850
Osu!

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.590
Well, let's go.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.440
Yeah.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.160
Thank you for everything, Wing-san!

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.810
Yeah, same here.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.910
Thank you.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.570
Take care, you two.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.990
Zushi, until we meet again!

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.140
Osu!

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.900
Well, you finally accomplished
your objective, right?

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.430
Uh-huh.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.270
Then we don't have any more business here.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.460
Gon, what are you going to do?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.100
Go back to Whale Island.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.690
Whale Island?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.020
Uh-huh.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.970
I was able to return the favor to Hisoka,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.450
so I want to go back to the island,
and show Mito-san my license.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.200
It's been over half a year since I left...

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.050
I guess I'll come with you.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.710
Huh?

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.360
I'd like to meet Mito-san.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.340
Really?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.000
Then let's go together.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.340
Yeah, I'll just tag along.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.890
Bye-bye, Heavens Arena.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.730
Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.680
and return the tag, as he'd promised.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.850
Despite losing the fight,

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.780
Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:15.960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.780
Today, we introduce...

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.380
Gon!

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.790
Gon learned that he still
has a ways to go,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:07.910
Me?

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.620
Gon became my first friend,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.240
after we met during the Hunter Exam.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.020
but he also met his goal of
repaying an old debt.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.570
He's fun to be around because

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.250
his expressions are always changing,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.960
He's intent on getting stronger.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.960
and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.170
Next time: Ging x And x Gon!

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.310
Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.050
I-I-I can't do much,
but thank you for letting me stay!

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.300
You're stuttering.
