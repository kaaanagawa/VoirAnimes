00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.570
Consider this a warning...

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.590
First,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.560
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.580
Second,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.310
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.890
Third,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.950
never mention the Troupe again.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.010
If you do,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.830
I'll kill you.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.830
Trick x To The x Trick

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.980
Leorio has volunteered for
the fourth round.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.340
If he wins, the group's victory is assured.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.070
But can he win?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.950
Okay!

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.440
I'll finish up the job.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.190
Toss that guy out, and send in
your next competitor!

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.950
We can't do that.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.450
What's that?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.520
We can't move him yet,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.720
because his match hasn't been settled.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.710
The match hasn't been settled?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.210
What do you mean?

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.280
He's still alive.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.590
He was only knocked out.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.610
Did you forget?

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.250
This was a death match.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.750
The fight doesn't end until one
contestant surrenders or dies.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.520
He's still alive, and he
hasn't surrendered.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.080
Tsk... Damned technicalities!

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.750
But she's right.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.070
I agree.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.250
I see...

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.290
Hey, Kurapika!

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.250
Go finish off that worthless trash.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.250
I refuse.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.240
Huh?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.450
Why?!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.010
The fight is over.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.680
He'd already lost his will to fight

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.330
when I punched him.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.770
I will not fight someone who's lost.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.220
Screw that!

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.600
Then what do we do?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.780
They're claiming that the
match hasn't ended!

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.860
Let him handle it.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.790
Huh?!

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.290
Once he wakes up,
we'll have our answer.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.770
Hey, now...

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.680
We only have so much time left.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.700
We can't afford to just sit and wait!

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.790
I have no intention of killing him!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.540
Come on!

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.300
Hey...

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
If you don't want to dirty
your hands, I'll do it.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.430
Killua?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.510
You haven't ever killed
anyone before, right?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.060
Are you scared?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.810
I have never considered whether
murder is frightening.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.570
But this is a one-on-one battle.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.320
You aren't permitted to interfere.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.380
Okay, then...

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.420
But we're working as a team,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.950
so you shouldn't be too selfish.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.670
Oh!

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.530
You do say useful things sometimes!

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.860
Keep it up!

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.330
Don't you understand that you're
screwing up our chances?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.560
I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.340
You stubborn fool...

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.970
Fine!

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.590
A majority decision...

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.850
O to kill him,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.100
and X to leave him alive.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.100
Ready, and...

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.810
Why isn't it working?!

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.990
Maybe it's because we're
asking the question?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.570
Huh?

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.630
The watches only work for questions
presented by the examiners.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.290
I see...

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.330
Okay!

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.860
Then we'll use a show of hands!

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.580
Those who agree that he
should be finished off...

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.940
Now!

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.610
You traitor...

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.650
Weren't you just lecturing
Kurapika with me?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.800
We're supposed to be a team...
A team!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.200
But it's pointless!

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.850
He's not gonna change his mind.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.920
Hey, Gon!

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.960
Why do you oppose killing him?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.940
Kurapika's right.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.360
He was on the verge of surrendering.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.860
Let's wait for him to wake up.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.070
We don't know how long
that will take.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.620
I should just...

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.000
You shouldn't force others to do things.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.120
Different people have different
circumstances and ideals.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.750
No one asked your opinion.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.880
Hey...

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.140
A majority ruling implies that you're
asking everyone's opinion.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.420
Damn it! Fine!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.200
Do whatever you want!

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.770
Leorio...

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.020
Man, what's wrong with these people?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.270
Now he's sulking.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.100
None of this matters if we can't even progress.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.050
Don't you people get it?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.660
Just leave him alone.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.530
<i>Fools...</i>

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.530
<i>They've fallen for the trap
of the majority decision.</i>

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.640
<i>You would expect it to be easier
for five people who've just met</i>

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.290
<i>to make decisions by majority rule.</i>

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.460
<i>While this method appears to
revere each individual opinion,</i>

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.300
<i>in actuality, it suppresses the minority.</i>

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.000
<i>When a person consistently finds himself
in the minority,</i>

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.710
<i>his opinion is always rejected.</i>

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.980
<i>His alienation,</i>

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.990
<i>anger, and discontent lead to antagonism.</i>

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.320
<i>Eventually, the team dissolves.</i>

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.280
<i>After all, we're rivals in
this Hunter Exam.</i>

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.880
<i>None of us would just
stand by and watch,</i>

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.780
<i>as our chances were hurt</i>

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.930
<i>by someone else's dumb mistakes.</i>

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.750
<i>But having been caught up in
the spirit of this test,</i>

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.200
<i>he's begun using majority decision
in unrelated situations.</i>

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.220
<i>And he made the mistake of holding</i>

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.680
<i>a discussion before the vote.</i>

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.680
<i>He even used majority decision in its
worst form, a public show of hands.</i>

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.160
<i>Unlike when people press the buttons
of their own watches,</i>

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.390
<i>everyone knows who diverged
from the majority.</i>

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.940
<i>So the minority can't even
protest the decision.</i>

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.660
<i>When someone feels they have no say,</i>

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.900
<i>and that their opinions are
constantly rejected,</i>

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.030
<i>the group breaks down.</i>

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.360
<i>In this case,</i>

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.210
<i>it means all five of us will fail the exam.</i>

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.840
<i>It's just a matter of time.</i>

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.470
The atmosphere on the
other side is gloomy.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.540
I've been waiting for you...

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.630
...Hisoka.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.890
I'm not an examiner this year.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.510
I'm here for revenge.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.680
Since last year's exam,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.250
all I've focused on was killing you.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.350
Today, I'll get payback

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.530
for my scars!

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.010
Hmph.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.110
Those scars merely show that you
were an incompetent examiner.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.860
You're blaming me for your
own inadequacies.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.470
Keep yapping!

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.860
Prepare to die.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.210
Dual wielding?

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.790
Infinite quad wielding!

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.210
Take this...

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.020
It's not over yet!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.590
Up, down, left, right.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.690
Front and back...

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.150
You have nowhere to run!

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.160
You'll be cut from every angle,
by my endless stream of blades.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.010
Dodging my infinite attack waves
is impossible!

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.000
I'll have you writhe in pain...

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.130
...until you die, Hisoka!

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.480
It would indeed be difficult
to dodge your attacks.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.100
Thus, I should simply stop the blades.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.780
<i>Impossible...</i>

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.860
<i>It took me over half a year
to master catching those blades!</i>

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.530
Oh...

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.330
It was easier than anticipated.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.580
I appreciate your futile efforts.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.450
Damn it!

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:45.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.140
Hisoka

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.660
Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first
to pass the Third Phase.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.750
Total time, six hours and
seventeen minutes.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.830
Tsk...

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.310
Is something wrong, Gon?

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.310
Uh-huh.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.700
I get it...

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.730
Hey...

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.080
It's quite possible that
he's already dead.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.490
What's that?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.470
Well, it's been several hours,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.410
and he hasn't moved an inch.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.950
Damn...

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.490
It's too far away for us to tell.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.860
Hey! We want to check his body!

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.360
What's that?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.360
He could already be dead.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.370
I already told you,
he's only unconscious.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.460
How many hours has it been?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.200
I can't just take your word for it!

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.110
Then let's make a bet.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.250
A bet?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.380
On what?

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.120
On whether he's dead or alive.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.260
What would we wager?

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.190
Time.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:53.810
Time?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.000
We will settle our match through
a betting game, a gamble.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.030
And we'll use time, rather than chips.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.740
Look at the monitor on the wall.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.240
We each have fifty hours.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.610
However, we can only wager
multiples of ten.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.250
We continue placing bets until one
of us has no hours left.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.220
A match where we gamble time...

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.580
We'll take turns deciding
what to bet on.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.750
If you end up with zero hours,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.740
your time limit will also be
shortened by fifty hours.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.230
And if you end up with zero hours?

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.730
Our sentences will be
extended by fifty years.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.730
If these terms are acceptable,

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.240
I'll check whether he's still alive.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.790
Leroute...

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.460
Serving a 112-year sentence

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.290
for endangered species trafficking
and illegal gambling.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.950
This match sounds like
her kind of game.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.730
Man, this chick is whack.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.700
She's willing to risk extending
her own sentence.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.180
Consider your answer carefully, Leorio.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.970
If you lose, we'll have
fifty fewer hours

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.690
with which to escape the tower.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.130
You shouldn't talk...

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.100
After all, this is your fault,
for not finishing him off!

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.150
Fine!

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.350
I won't say another word!

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.090
Hey, we shouldn't fight
amongst ourselves!

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.720
<i>Keep fighting, keep fighting...</i>

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.710
Right!

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.560
I accept!

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.000
Okay! I chose our first bet,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.490
so you can decide how
many hours we'll wager

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.060
on whether he's alive or dead.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.220
I bet ten hours that he's alive.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.220
What's this?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.400
You were the one whining
over his being dead.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.230
Very well. Then let's check.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.070
You're being pretty cautious...

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.370
Weren't you going to not
say anything else?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.490
<i>Ten hours, huh?</i>

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.500
<i>This was the obvious choice.</i>

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.070
<i>Even if I'm wrong,</i>

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.000
<i>as long as we confirm his death,</i>

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.280
<i>Kurapika will have won his round.</i>

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.130
<i>If he's really unconscious,</i>

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.890
<i>I'll just kick his ass.</i>

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.440
See? He's only unconscious.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.150
So it seems.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:48.650
All right...

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.010
Leorio has the lead!

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.890
This is bad.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.660
Huh?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.640
It's possible he isn't going to wake up.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.070
What do you mean?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.600
Remember when that woman

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.880
walked near the guy on the floor?

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.010
What of it?

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.050
I thought then

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.380
that he was already dead.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.720
But on second thought,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.520
they'd obviously prefer him alive,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.060
but remaining unconscious.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.590
If he doesn't wake up
before the test ends,

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.720
it shortens their sentences
by seventy-two years.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.200
So if he doesn't wake up...

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.740
That's my point!

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.570
That's been their intention all along.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.190
Well, it's your turn.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.400
Decide what we'll bet on.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.080
Let's see...

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.590
How about we bet on whether
he's truly unconscious?

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.590
Huh?

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.590
I see.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.450
<i>Hey, what am I supposed to do?</i>

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.690
<i>The note didn't cover this.</i>

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.490
<i>When I woke up, a note next to me</i>

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.060
<i>told me to feign unconsciousness,</i>

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.350
<i>and to hide the note in my mouth.</i>

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.750
<i>I understood the plan immediately.</i>

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.750
<i>If I can buy time by pretending
to be asleep,</i>

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.750
<i>our sentences will be shortened
by seventy-two years!</i>

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.500
<i>So, then what do I do?</i>

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.760
<i>Should I stay down?</i>

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.680
Very well.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.010
I bet twenty hours that he
really is unconscious.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.880
<i>Okay, got it...</i>

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.110
<i>I'm supposed to keep acting
like I'm unconscious!</i>

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.900
But how do we confirm whether
he's really unconscious?

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.450
Oh...

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.230
That's simple.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.410
This guy's heavy...

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.420
I'll just toss him off the edge.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.420
<i>Wh-What the hell?!</i>

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.110
If he's actually unconscious,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.040
he'll fall to his death.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.180
Are you insane?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.410
His match hasn't been settled yet.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.480
We can't accept those terms.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.550
Don't worry.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.190
If he falls and dies,

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.230
we'll forfeit the match,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.450
which will give you two wins.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.890
Is that satisfactory?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.400
Yes,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.200
it is.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.190
<i>What was that?</i>

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.280
<i>Don't be ridiculous...</i>

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.710
<i>We're talking about my life here!</i>

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.480
But then I'm changing my wager.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.020
I bet forty hours that he
isn't unconscious.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.340
Everything I have left.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.230
Heh, little sneak.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.410
Finally showing your true colors.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.380
Then, I'll let go of him.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.120
Whoa! Wait!

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.970
I'm awake! I'm awake...

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.580
Don't let go!

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.090
Wait! Whoa...

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.850
I'm gonna fall!

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.090
Good morning.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.360
You people are crazy.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.840
I've had enough!

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.890
I'll take the loss!

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.400
Forget the sentence reduction!

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.650
It's safer in prison...

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.910
You knew that he was awake.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.970
I actually aspire to become a doctor.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.810
All I had to do was check
his eye movement.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.880
However, you're down
to twenty hours.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.380
But now we have a 2-1 lead.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.390
Now...

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.770
It's your turn!

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.730
What do you want to bet on?

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.760
Majitani surrenders,

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.400
giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.060
However, in the time-betting match,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.710
they're down 80-20.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.550
What will Leroute choose to bet on?

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.690
Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.800
Bulldog... Bulldog...

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.030
Bulldog scramble!
