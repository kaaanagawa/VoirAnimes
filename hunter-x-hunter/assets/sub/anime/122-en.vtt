WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
I can no longer think of him...

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.980
as a target to destroy.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.760
He acknowledged our efforts.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.390
He wasn't a bad guy.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.100
In that case, I no longer have...

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.030
any reason to defeat him.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.000
The King...

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.000
The soldiers are not important.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.980
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.010
Pose x And x Name

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.730
This is an area used for testing weapons of war.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.550
We won't need to restrain ourselves.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.480
Why do you fight?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.490
You have no chance of defeating me.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.220
Why rush to your death?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.350
You presume to know I cannot win?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.120
You know nothing about me.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.800
If you judge me by my appearance,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.200
you'll get burned.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.260
You have it backwards.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.470
You don't seem like some ordinary man
who can't read the state of the battle.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.940
I was born to rule this world.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.400
Originally, you humans were as
no more than livestock to me.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.530
But I have changed my mind.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.720
I learned that there are a few
humans worth keeping alive.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.000
Like that woman.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.000
I sense that you are worthy, as well.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.590
If you back down now,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.030
I am willing to spare your life.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.890
You'll only spare my life, yes?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.880
Given my position,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.990
I can't accept that offer.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.000
Meanwhile...

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.640
In exchange for his agreement to stay still,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.360
Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain
just what had happened.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.430
Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling
him what happened after the attack.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.990
In other words, everything since
they'd been separated.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.160
Pitou made it a point to include
details that Gon did not know,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.240
to ensure that Gon's attention would
be focused on the explanation.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.930
Pitou deliberately did not mention
how the King had held Komugi

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.890
because Pitou did not know how to
describe the events accurately.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.240
There was no significant change in Gon.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.660
However...

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.470
Pitou knew the plan had succeeded
when Gon's eyes wavered briefly.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.620
The King...

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.050
left with the enemy of his own
volition, by that doorway.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.280
There is no need for us to go.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.310
I see.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.320
He went south.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.570
I understand.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620
A fine play, Pitou.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.530
Then we should await the King's return here.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.830
To maintain only my outward appearance,
I only need one-seventh of my flies.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.430
The other six-sevenths

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.720
will go to the King!

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.970
You fight with the resolve to lose?

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.750
I do not understand.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.000
You fight for the human race?

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.880
If so, then know that my actions
are, in fact, for their benefit.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.310
For example, in human society,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.700
lands are divided by national borders,
much like territorial marking.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.380
On the right side of the border,
children may starve to death.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.050
While on the left, scum who do nothing
have everything they need.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.120
Absolute madness.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.910
I shall crush that madness...

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.370
And create a world so fair,

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.300
the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.180
I concede that

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.950
I will initially use power and terror
to accomplish my objective.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.820
But I will only do so to the extent
necessary to maintain order.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.070
I have learned what power
is meant to be used for.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.440
To protect the weak,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.040
who deserve to live.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.550
Power is not meant to be used
to torment the defeated!

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.190
This could be a problem...

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.750
I shall not fight you.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.710
I agreed to leave the palace

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.790
so we could have a free, open discussion.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.160
He's wavering...

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.700
Come closer.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.870
Wavering between Ant and human.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.220
And he hasn't realized

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.940
that those two sides are incompatible.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.820
And neither one

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.510
is dominant yet.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.140
But regardless of which side he falls to,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.010
the outcome won't change.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.490
We're counting on you.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.650
You have a single mission.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.370
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.170
There have already been many casualties.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.330
We will use any means necessary.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.880
Will that be acceptable?

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.880
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.570
We simply desire

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.230
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.110
Understood.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:16.860
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.300
to take the blame.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.370
I must make this fast...

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.330
Before my heart is swayed.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.970
King...

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.280
We are both in difficult positions.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.960
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.960
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.460
First Hand

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.770
First Hand!

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260
That's...

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.950
I can't sense anyone else fighting.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.410
Does that mean I'm the only one left?

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.440
Youpi!

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.440
Pouf!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.480
You've changed a lot since I last saw you.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.800
I could say the same to you.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.890
I had to escape without alerting the enemy.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.940
And if I move all my dispersed particles
at once, it's too conspicuous.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.040
So I must go slowly.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.290
I'm sure you're feeling impatient,
but please spare me a moment.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.270
I need to tell you what's happening.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.920
Well, I suppose you have your own concerns...

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.190
You've grown up.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.780
And there you have it.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.880
I have no conclusive proof

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.690
that the change in Pitou will
actually benefit the King...

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.780
Through his own experiences,
Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.400
Youpi...

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.920
What do you think we should do?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.110
This was a test.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.330
Which made it very clear to Youpi

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.120
that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.290
Pitou and Youpi had undergone.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.500
A foolish question.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.510
We must go

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.310
to the King at once!

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.470
And that's all there is to it... Right?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.530
His response was entirely sincere.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.480
Indeed.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.780
He was concerned only with
leaving as soon as possible.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.280
Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.720
I'm sure that was a direct hit...

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.210
He's tough!

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.110
A good attack.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.310
I could not anticipate it.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.390
Are you satisfied now?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.600
He still wants me to sit with him?

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.870
I shall not repeat myself.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.440
Third Hand

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.990
Third Hand!

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.880
I can no longer back down!

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.110
Are you really so eager to die?

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.980
From the King's perspective,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.130
the wrath that was unleashed

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.360
was no stronger than that
of a child throwing a fit.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.740
Yet it was violent enough to induce
Netero to more than double the distance

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.520
between the King and him.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.870
It was an insult likened to laughing off

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.460
Netero's declaration that

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.610
he would not back down.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.830
Come on...

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.260
You will only influence me by using words.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.270
Damned newborn brat.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.910
If it were that simple,
I wouldn't have to do this!

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.010
Wait...

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.480
By using...

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.520
words?

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:54.990
King...

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.350
Would you like to know your name?

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.230
How would you know my name?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:17.260
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.980
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.360
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.410
Interested in fighting me now?

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.750
If you can force me to admit defeat,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.190
I will tell you your name.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.590
Force you to admit defeat

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.240
without killing you?

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.530
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.780
No matter.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.980
I shall checkmate you shortly.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.500
The real battle between Netero
and the King has begun.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.560
Next time: Centipede x And x Memory.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.020
Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.460
Uh, what do you want to be?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.140
In my next life, I want to be me,
and meet you again.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.240
Stupid!
