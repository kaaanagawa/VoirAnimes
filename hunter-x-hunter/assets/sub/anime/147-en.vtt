00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Something,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.090
will you forgive me for being a

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.710
bad big brother?

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.010
'Kay.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.340
I...

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.500
love Killua.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.910
Don't make the same mistake.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.950
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.970
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.100
but either way, you should apologize!

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.670
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.820
Do you know it?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.650
Huh?

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.600
No, what is it?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.760
You promise to do things differently next time.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.610
And you keep that promise, no matter what.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.280
Uh-huh.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.990
Salvation x And x Future

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.140
She had red hair just like yours.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.000
I shot her because

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.220
I knew that the scumbags pursuing her

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.300
enjoyed keeping their prey alive to toy with.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.070
After my rebirth as an Ant,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.490
I realized that I was doing the
same things I'd done before.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.530
Before I was reborn this way,
my job was to get rid of people.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.470
When ordered to, I pulled the trigger.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.410
I spent the rest of my time yelling at people.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.010
It was a job anyone could do.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.580
A ridiculous cycle that continues even after rebirth.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.910
I wanted to give her an escape from that cycle.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.020
I didn't know exactly how it all worked,

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.600
but...

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600
I felt that if I let them capture her,
torture her, then kill her,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.530
the cycle would repeat itself.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.490
A dull life in the middle of nowhere,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.870
but one lived in peace and quiet...

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.740
Until that life was suddenly ended
by mindless violence.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.130
I pulled the trigger

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.540
with a prayer that she would escape that cycle.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.280
Regardless of my actions,
the Queen ate hundreds of humans.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.000
And when they were reborn, only a few
could remember their prior lives.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.730
It's possible that most of the human
souls managed to safely escape.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.160
But I wanted to do something.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.250
I wanted to feel like I was helping them escape.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.280
If you're inside that body instead of her,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.190
that probably means she escaped,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.790
and I still haven't run into an Ant

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.180
who's told me I killed them in their prior life.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.050
Perhaps they were all able to escape.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.430
Before all this happened, I didn't believe
in the human soul's existence.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.690
I believed that humans had

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.740
the same worth as flies or fleas,
and that they only lived and then died.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.790
That the ego was nothing more

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.950
than a bug that arose because the human
brain was slightly more complex.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.090
That there was nothing after death.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.470
Our bodies simply decomposed,
turned to dust, and scattered.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.970
I believed those tiny fragments had no purpose.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.300
But now, here I am.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.570
And I'm repeating the cycle.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.960
My appearance is completely different,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.720
but I'm doing the same stupid things as before.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.610
It made me think.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.470
I may be a fool, but I won't deny
the things that I know now.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.330
And I don't want to ignore the
things I don't understand.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.960
I died.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.310
I died, and my body was broken into tiny pieces.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.540
But that wasn't the end.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.460
The fragments that I believed were
too small to retain any meaning

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.760
possessed a power I could have never imagined.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.980
Particles no larger than pollen from our perspective

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.830
have enough energy to impact our health

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.290
tens or hundreds of millions of years later.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.900
And our DNA, which is even smaller,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.920
contains the vast amount of information that
comprises us, all within a double helix.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.410
And that infinitesimally small
size is a necessity for

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.350
the birth of the enormous space
known as the universe.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:44.430
Just because something is small does
not mean it produces less energy.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.220
The soul is probably small, but it has
enough energy to repeat the cycle.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.680
Does that mean I was reborn to continue that cycle?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.560
I don't know what the future holds.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.310
So this is nothing more than
speculation on my part,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.280
but something inside told me that I
mustn't repeat the same things again.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.850
I'm guessing that I'm forced
to repeat all of this because

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.420
there was something I failed to provide
my soul with while I was alive.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.090
You know how the body

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.130
moves more slowly without
the soul's encouragement...

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.830
In my case, I've always been driven by the thought

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.420
that I can't let things stay this way.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.510
I know it isn't right.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.000
I will repeat the cycle,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.250
while thinking that I have to change things.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.470
Because I made the wrong choice.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.160
My target shouldn't have been that girl.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.400
It should have been the ones pursuing her.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.980
It's no big deal.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.000
It just means I was the biggest scumbag of all.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.400
The price for cleansing a tainted
soul was too heavy,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.670
so I avoided that.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.310
While selfishly praying that her soul would escape,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.880
I was desperate to avoid getting hurt myself.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.690
I shot her to protect myself.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.530
And now, I'm trying to save myself again
by confessing my sins to you,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.280
the one who inherited her appearance.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.560
Really...

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.250
I'm a hopeless case.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.780
I appreciate your listening to my story.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.410
Wait. Don't run away.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.670
You come with me.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.760
Forever.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.920
You'll stay with the person you shot,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.080
living life the only way you can.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.590
This is your duty.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.930
You have no choice.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.440
No one will allow you to take your own life

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.440
and hit the reset button.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.440
You must live and apologize to me every day.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.990
I'll keep you so busy, you'll never have time

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.480
to worry about what's right or wrong.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.410
You will apologize to me

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.840
and do the work I tell you to do,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.850
as you devote your life to me.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:54.610
If you forget your current resolve and slip,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.630
I will kill you.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.220
So you can focus on living.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.690
Kite, you have a visitor.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.620
Let them in.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.900
Kite?

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.800
Yeah.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.770
Sorry.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.020
Come. Sit.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.290
Sorry for what?

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.800
I wasn't able to fight by your side.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.310
I wasn't

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.300
strong enough.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.320
But...

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.570
Next time, I'll protect you!

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.400
It sounds like you did some
crazy stuff to defeat Pitou.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.800
Yeah, I almost died...

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.010
However, that doesn't change the fact
that you defeated an enemy I couldn't.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.330
I suppose I can soothe my ego by telling myself

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.000
that my judgment was correct.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.670
But I wouldn't be here now without
help from Killua and everyone else.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.600
I didn't make it here by myself.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.340
It appears that we both needed more training.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.640
I heard that you met Ging-san.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.000
Did you talk to Ging?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.880
Yeah.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.810
You should go back to him.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.630
I understand what you wanted to say.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.140
I'm glad you came to see me.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.900
If I need help, I promise to let you know.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.480
Say hi to Killua for me.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.070
We're friends now.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.160
So right now, go back to Ging-san.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.100
Okay.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.050
Sorry.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.620
Sorry for what?

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.690
I was trying to take the easy way out
by running away from everything.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.500
No matter the pain, I will keep living.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.760
So when I die, I'll feel I did the best I could.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.340
Ging!

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.230
I'm waiting atop the World Tree.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.330
I tried to stop him...

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.190
Yeah, he didn't say that he
would wait for me <i>here</i>...

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.790
It's huge!

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.790
This is definitely the tallest tree in the world.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.200
The World Tree stands at the city's center,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.620
at a height of 1,784 meters.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:41.310
Humans are still unable to build a taller structure.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.070
Climbing the tree is not forbidden,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.580
but you must pay a fee and sign a written agreement.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.430
You can reach the 500-meter
point by elevator or stairs,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.520
but after that, you'll be risking your life.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.240
Every year, around 3,000
people attempt the climb,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:09.030
but 94% fail to reach the 1,000-meter
point, and turn back.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:15.740
Another 4% are forced to pay an extremely
pricey fee to be rescued from the tree,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.600
and another 1% fall and die.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.260
Which means that, each year,
only about 30 people make it

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.430
to the top and return safely.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.870
So...

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.670
This is as far as we're going.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.710
Yeah.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.130
Be careful.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.510
Yeah.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.370
Killua, thank you for everything.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.140
Yeah.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.000
Well,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.640
after you told me you would defeat Pitou alone

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.570
and that it was none of my business,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.070
I was pretty depressed!

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.450
I'm really sorry...

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.080
Brother!

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.890
Well, you apologized.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.840
And I think I can say I'm only here with Alluka
now because of the time I spent with you.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.920
She's the one who healed you.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.920
Huh?! Is that true?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.840
Why are you telling me now?

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.940
You should have told me sooner!

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.010
Sorry.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.270
We don't want too many people knowing about this.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.340
You know, it's sort of a complicated family thing...

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.300
Come with me!

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.270
Alluka, can you tell Something to come out?

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.440
Yeah.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.620
She has the power to grant any wish I make.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.650
Any wish?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.210
Because of that power,
she was locked up in our house.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.220
But thanks to you, she's outside now.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.500
And I'm prepared to spend the
rest of my life protecting her.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.430
We should be the ones thanking you.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.370
'Kay.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.080
N-No way...

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.240
I should be thanking you!

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.000
This is no good. If we stay here any longer...

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.520
Yeah.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.680
I'll be traveling to all kinds of places with Alluka.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.740
I'll e-mail you from time to time.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.280
Me, too.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.470
If anything comes up, let me know.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.930
I'll do the same.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.170
Yeah, I will.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.540
Since you owe me a lot...

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.450
Say hi to your dad for me.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.540
Yep.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.790
I want to go with you, but I have to watch Alluka.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.940
And you haven't had a chance to talk alone yet.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.470
See you around.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.300
After I've had my brother all to
myself for a while, I'll set him free.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.890
Will you hang out with him then?

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:37.920
Hold on!

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.140
I'm the one choosing to hang out with him!

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.480
Isn't she a great sister?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.310
Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned,
you're in second place.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.460
Kite said that no matter where we go,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.130
we'll always be friends!

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.330
Yeah!

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.730
Bye!

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.700
Later!

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.300
Next time: Past x And x Future.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.670
I'll introduce you to Ging eventually!

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.200
Yeah, that's a promise.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.130
So until we meet again!

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.110
Yeah!
