WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.150
That is most likely a Conjurer's work.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.050
Yeah, that's gotta be it.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.060
These buildings weren't here yesterday.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.470
This has to be <i>Nen</i>.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.840
Man, these guys are really crazy...

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.420
They have someone who can
conjure entire buildings!

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.170
It's safe to assume that
they're rigged somehow.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.160
Yeah.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.180
That tells us they're still using
this place as their base.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.980
The problem is

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.170
that these buildings create
too many blind spots.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.680
I can only watch twenty
percent of the area at a time.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.780
However,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.280
if you move around too much,
you could run into one of them.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.940
I'd like to avoid that.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.540
I mean,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.020
I have no idea what I'd do if I
heard their voices behind me...

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.200
My heart is pounding.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.480
Voices?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.200
Huh?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.410
Oh, never mind. I read you.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.230
For now, return to your original position.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900
I'll call you back in five minutes.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.600
Hello? Melody?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.960
How's it going on your side?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.950
We're still shopping.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.670 line:20%
Let me see that one.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.560
This might be harder than
regular bodyguard work.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.920 line:20%
It's not too bad...

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.900
Basho's about to snap.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.770
Let's go back to the other store.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.220
Yes, I know.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.060
Beloved x And x Beleaguered

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.190
You've already told me everything that Uvo

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.640
knew about the chain user?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.250
Yeah, when we were investigating

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.110
the Nostrade Family using the Hunter website,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
Uvo pointed to three members at the top.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.960
It was late night on the 1st when we realized
they were the daughter's bodyguards.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.460
And I met that daughter yesterday.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.560
And that's when you stole her power.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.470
Yeah.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.470
And here is an updated list of bodyguards.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.850
There are two new members.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.180
Wow.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.050
They already have new information up?

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.280
Seven bodyguards...

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.050
Perhaps more.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.460
That's a lot of people to guard one girl.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.990
He must love his daughter.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.490
He probably cares more about her ability.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.480
Her father achieved his current
status by using her power.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.380
There are many who resent his advancement.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.920
But why did she come to Yorknew City?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.380
For the auction, I'd imagine.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.720
Boss?

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.930
Shizuku, Pakunoda...

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.750
Yes?

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.670
Nice...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.140
Actually, I'm an idiot.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.940
Damn, what's wrong with me?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.320
If I'd stopped to consider why their
boss's daughter is in Yorknew City,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.450
we could have found the chain user sooner.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.420
It's safe to assume that this
girl came to Yorknew City

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.200
for the auction.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.700
I was too focused on her fortunetelling
to give any regard to that.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.140
According to the website,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.370
this girl also collects body parts.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.910
Body parts...

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.470
The Scarlet Eyes!

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.750
Yes.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.220
The chain user joined the
Nostrade Family for a reason.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.130
He knew that the Scarlet Eyes
would be sold at the auction,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.720
and that Nostrade's daughter
would be interested in them.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.290
The chain user desires two things.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.580
To exact revenge upon us,
and to recover his people's eyes.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.990
Shal, were we able to steal the Scarlet Eyes?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.410
Sorry, I'm not sure.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.250
I had the auctioneer running on
autopilot throughout the auction.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.010
Kortopi, do you remember
copying the Scarlet Eyes?

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.880
I copied them.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.590
Your copies function as <i>En</i>.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.130
Can you tell where the copy is?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.290
If I'm touching the real one.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.040
Found them.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.920
Got it.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.660
There's something of the same shape

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.160
approximately 2,500 meters in that direction.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.660
Is the chain user there?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.630
We should hurry.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.130
The <i>En</i> effect will fade in a few hours.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.920
Do you have a map?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.370
Here.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.850
North-northwest...

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.270
2,500 meters.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.940
Hotel Beitacle.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.320
Boss...

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.680
Let me go.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.180
Please.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.060
Very well.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.360
But I shall accompany you.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.470
Yes, sir.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.070
Paku, Machi, Shizuku,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.740
you're coming, too.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.100
Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.210
Okay.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.900
Hello?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.490
Oh, Killua-kun?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.260
Yeah, who are you?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.060
One of Kurapika's colleagues.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.820
Could you look to your left?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.120
Hang up,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.470
and then whisper a command to me.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.470
Raise your right hand.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.830
Her ears are super sharp!

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.300
We can use this to our advantage.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.320
What?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.490
Didn't we already try this place before?

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.530
Hotel Beitacle is one of the places

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.560
where the Nostrade Family is staying.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.360
Yeah, but when Shal checked the website,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.120
they'd already checked out.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.570
They probably checked into that
hotel under a different name.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.400
They're being cautious.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.130
The rain keeps me from
hearing what's being said,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.560
but people are talking over there.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.390
Judging by the footsteps,
five or six, including women.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.760
They're heading in the opposite
direction from those ruined buildings.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.330
That's amazing.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.720
Gon and I have trained hard,
but I can't hear a thing.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.400
This happens to be my power.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.580
Kurapika must be getting desperate...

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.410
He actually asked me for help.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.060
Huh?

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.510
He wants to do everything himself, right?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.720
Oh...

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.410
Yeah, that's true.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.670
Are you an assassin?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.090
I used to be.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.420
How did you know?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.550
Your footsteps.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.070
You're right next to me, but they're estinto.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.430
Es-what?

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.890
Estinto...

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.680
A music term meaning barely audible.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.200
Oh, I'm in the habit of moving
without making any sound.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.120
You have the quietest step I've ever heard.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.690
Your technique is impressive.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.190
I can see why Kurapika would rely on you.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.950
Well, I'm not too thrilled about this.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.820
Oh? Really?

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.700
Stop.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.790
They're one hundred meters
around the next corner.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.260
You can pick out their footsteps?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.300
Everyone's are slightly different.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.840
Oh...

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.060
I'll take a look.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.270
Killua?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.620
The woman's here.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.790
She's with her buddies.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.380
There are six, moving together.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.130
That topknot guy's here, too.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.280
One more thing.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.910
There's one person that
wasn't there yesterday.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.700
He's probably the leader.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.820
Can you describe him?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.980
He's wearing a black coat,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.070
with St. Peter's cross on the back.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.970
He has combed-back black hair.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.950
I can't see his face.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.210
And they're too alert!

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.630
I'm too afraid to circle around in front.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.350
Let me speak to him.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.660
Where are you now?

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.070
In front of the Motoba Building.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.590
They're walking west,
on Continental Street.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.910
There's a station nearby.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.410
Can you make it onto their train?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.350
It depends on the circumstances.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.720
If it's busy, I can manage.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.160
Leorio, take us south.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.210
Okay!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.480
Melody's in the same car as they are.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.860
This train's headed toward Castor.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.870
I'm in the last car.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.320
Castor...

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.490
The auction site's that way.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.780
So is our hotel...

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.860
Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.050
I know, Eliza.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.880
I'm sick of this job!

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.070
I should be happy I get to
spend time with the dogs?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.390
Well, it beats taking care of
that spoiled brat, I guess.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.190
I'm fond of Neon-sama,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.950
but she's too active for me.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.400
Look at this, Eliza!

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.890
It's so cute!

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.930
Well, hang in there a little longer.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.580
I'll find a better job soon enough...

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.500
Who's there?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.420
Room service.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.280
Leave it in front of the door.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.180
Okay, let's eat.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.720
Man, I seriously need to
find a different job...

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.250
I don't have the energy for this.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.070
But I need a job that will support
Eliza and these guys...

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.710
That's hard to find...

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:17.570
Huh?

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.890
Don't worry.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.550
I'll figure something out.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.050
They got off?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.850
They got off at Liber Station.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.310
They're headed toward the
Saloma Department Store exit.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.610
That's not good.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.910
The hotel's that way.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.310
Seriously?!

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.310
They know we switched rooms?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.050
Damn, this isn't funny!

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.820
We need to escape fast!

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.280
I have to bring these.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.050
The station's over there.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.050
Shouldn't we get closer?

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:04.870
No.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.940
If we get any closer,

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.900
they might sense my animosity.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.130
Gon,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.790
the range I should stay at

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.290
is the distance from here
to the station entrance.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.670
I must attack from this distance
if I don't want to be noticed.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.300
It will take approximately 0.5
seconds to land an attack.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.120
That's more than enough
time for them to evade it.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.990
Unless they're distracted...

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.680
Spiders!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.390
They're on the move.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.750
Descending slowly.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.000
An elevator.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.500
Are they going out?

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.080
We should hurry, boss.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.720
We'll apprehend him as a group.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.170
Stay close enough to provide assistance.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.870
Pakunoda,

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.430
once we capture him,
get the information on Uvo.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.630
Got it.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.190
After that, Nobunaga,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.550
he's all yours.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.600
Go!

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.700
They're running toward the hotel.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.480
They're fast!

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.470
Can we get there faster by car?

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.330
It's rush hour.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.150
They might be faster on foot.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.510
Kurapika!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.870
Wait here until I contact you.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.570
Wait, Kurapika...

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.000
I have a good idea.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.370
Kurapika!

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.160
Melody and I are at the station entrance.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.000
Those six ran off to the northwest.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.040
Yeah, I'm following them!

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.150
Wait, you're running after them?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.010
That's dangerous!

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.730
They'll notice you!

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.870
Stop it!

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.800
Hey!

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.510
The bastard hung up on me...

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.610
Wow! What's that?

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.800
They're ninjas...

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.370
Target moving forty kilometers
per hour, in a 2:00 direction.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.990
He got in a vehicle.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.170
I was going to wait until I found another job,

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.370
but that's no longer an option.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.060
I'm quitting today!

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.250
Leorio, where's Gon?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.470
He ran after Kurapika.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.010
I was told to wait,
but I can't just sit around.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.130
I'm driving to Hotel Beitacle,
but I'm stuck in traffic!

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.020
Fine!

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.030
We're going after Kurapika!

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.020
Seriously...

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.740
These people just do whatever
the hell they want!

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.280
We're being followed.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.310
When did that happen?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.100
Oops.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.030
I was too focused on chasing the target.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.780
Is the chain user behind or in front of us?

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.210
Nobunaga, Pakunoda, and Kortopi,
pursue the target ahead.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.090
Roger that.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.520
Did you see them?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.700
I only caught a silhouette.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.260
I couldn't see their faces,
but one is in the alley.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.140
Another is behind the dumpster.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.250
Okay.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.820
Keep using <i>Gyo</i>.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.680
Yes, sir.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.420
Spiders...

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.700
Come and get it!

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.200
Stop it, Kurapika.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.330
We can't fight three of them

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.810
if they know we're here!

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.080
Okay, then it's all or nothing.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.340
Gon?!

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.630
Sorry!

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.210
I'll stop following, so can you let me go?

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.480
Him again?

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.850
This is the boy he mentioned?

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.970
The other one's here, too.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.340
Show yourself.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.150
What do you want?

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.810
The Mafia who put a reward on us are gone.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.590
Wh-What? Really?

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.570
Why?

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.060
What do we do, boss?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.180
Tie them up.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.070
Phinks? It's me.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.330
I need you to come to the Beitacle Hotel.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.720
Shouldn't we just kill them?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.360
No, I trust your instincts.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.740
If they're connected to the
chain user somehow,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.430
we should keep them alive.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.150
I wouldn't trust my instincts...

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.010
I have a question for you.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.310
How can you kill people who
have nothing to do with you?

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.680
You look pretty hostile,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.830
considering that you just surrendered.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.070
Why, indeed?

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.350
Because they have nothing to do with us?

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.460
No.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.750
On second thought, it isn't that simple.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.340
How to verbally express our motives...

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.270
I'm not fond of it.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.250
But oddly enough...

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.580
Or perhaps it's not that odd.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.370
Is that the key to understanding myself?

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.980
What's he talking about?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.510
Head to the hotel, and wait
for Phinks and the others.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.940
If they try to escape, kill them.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.510
Understood.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.240
Now that they're on the alert,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.520
we have to keep our distance,
or they'll notice us.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.740
Make sure you're concealing your presence.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.770
Damn!

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.460
You must be patient.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.630
I understand!

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.010
You don't understand!

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.390
Your reckless pursuit exposed
them to needless danger.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.020
Do you know why they let
themselves be captured?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.120
If you're caught here,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.420
no one will be able to stop the Troupe!

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.530
I'm sorry...

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.380
Humans have to lower their
guard at some point.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.780
It's an endurance test.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.850
We must wait.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.360
Yeah.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.380
Where's Squala?

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.440
He isn't answering his phone.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.930
It isn't the chain user.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.010
No.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.810
He was on the list.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.590
Get out.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.560
I'm pretty good at my job.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.810
I've survived some tight spots.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.820
There's a sort of gut instinct that
works only in those times.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.150
And mine tells me that this...

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.750
...is where I'll...

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.450
If you move an inch, I'll cut you down.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.090
I have a few questions,
so answer them honestly.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.100
One of your fellow bodyguards
uses chains, right?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.090
Where is he now?

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.080
What are you talking about?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.590
Who are you people?!

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.630
Do you realize that I'm with
the Nostrade Family...

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.050
Answer the question.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.930
I'll break your left arm next.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.060
Hey!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.820
I told you not to move.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.810
Stand perfectly still, and answer her questions.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.820
What happened to Uvogin?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.190
I'm talking about the huge man you captured.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.390
What?

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.060
He escaped!

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.700
I don't know what happened after that!

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.580
Where are your fellow bodyguards?

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.270
They already went back to the island.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.110
I was on my way back!

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.510
You shouldn't lie...

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.760
It's the truth.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.460
Why would I lie in this situation?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.480
Let me ask you one more time.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.280
Where is the chain user?

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.730
I don't know who you're talking about.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.340
None of the bodyguards uses chains!

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.770
One last question.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.850
Is there someone for whom

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.290
you care deeply?

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.310
I wouldn't have chosen
this job if there were!

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.880
So her name's Eliza...

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.130
She's pretty.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.870
If...

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.410
If you lay one finger on Eliza—

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.960
I warned you not to move...

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.390
Twice.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.450
Did you get any data on the chain user?

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.480
Naturally.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.360
It's too much trouble to explain,
so I'll shoot the information into you.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.420
With my Memory Bomb.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360
Recollection Bullet

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.120
Recollection Bullet
Memory Bomb

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.970
If you're concerned, I'll stop.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.620
Are you stupid? Hurry up.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.480
I see...

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.260
So that's what you look like, Kurapika-san.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.900
I won't forget your name
and face until I kill you!

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.190
The Phantom Troupe has finally
identified Uvogin's killer.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.870
Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.120
The final battle draws near.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon
