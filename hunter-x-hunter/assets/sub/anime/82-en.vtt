WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You didn't know?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.420
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.740
Rare?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.300
What trick is this?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.090
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.080
Thunderbolt!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.420 position:80% line:20%
Thunderbolt

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.590
First comes rock...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.680
Rock...

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.300
Paper...

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.520
Rock!

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.120
If you wish to become stronger,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.100
this is a perfect opportunity.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.230
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.580
Whether we win or lose,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.950
hell lies ahead of us.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.040
Kite x And x Slots

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.610
Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.570
deep within NGL, in search
of the Chimera Ant nest,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.620
and have arrived at a cliff
with peculiar openings.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.330
This is the Chimera Ant nest?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.630
No.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.990
They don't make their nests in holes.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.820
They use mud and feces to build them.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.940
Let's go.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.920
You'll understand once we're inside.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.120
There's no telling when or
from where they will attack.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.240
Be on your guard.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.950
Yeah, got it.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.970
That other Chimera Ant

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.930
completely concealed his presence.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.880
Yeah.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.240
Let's go.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.260
Is this place...

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.030
Yes, it is NGL's hidden side.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.200
A drug factory.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.630
Exactly.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.290
This factory produces the ingestible drug D²,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.350
which is spreading throughout the mainland.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.900
There are probably nearby bila trees,
which produce its main ingredient.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.890
Ironic given their claims as preservationists.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.280
They're making more than drugs.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.700
Look.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.420
It's the same as the others.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.100
I assume that only the NGL leaders
know the truth of this place.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.430
The other members

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.930
joined because they honestly loved nature.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.060
So this facility is the center
of NGL's underground.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.940
If it's empty...

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.870
Then Chimera Ants have wiped
out the NGL underground.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.950
And a bunch of amateurs with guns
won't suffice to deal with them.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.020
What about their boss?

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.310
He either escaped or was eaten.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.830
Either way, it's bad news.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.920
Huh? What do you mean?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.690
Shh!

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.590
A few are around.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.910
They're slowly approaching
through the middle tunnel.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.440
There are more in the left and right tunnels.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.270
En...

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.730
How far away can you search?

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.370
Everything within a forty-five meter radius.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.630
F-Forty-five meters?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.740
Depending on physical and mental condition,
I can increase that by a few meters.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.500
Here they come.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.110
Keep it down, you two.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.150
Who are you guys?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.160
How dare you intrude on my turf?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.500
Help... Please help us!

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.470
Stop talking, Spot!

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.580
You're just a damned dog!

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.120
Oops, didn't mean to do that.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.490
Oh, well.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.680
I'm getting bored with these guys.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.750
Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.720
When you beg like that,
I just want to kill you more.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.190
Stop!

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.320
Kite...

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.820
Don't move carelessly.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.400
There's more than one enemy.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.330
They want you to rush over.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.080
Bye-bye.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.020
H-Hel—

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.350
Don't look away.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.990
If they shoot a projectile your way,
you won't be able to see it.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.670
I've got it.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.540
You three will be my new dogs.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.150
Chimera Ants have always been aggressive,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.130
but it seems consuming malicious humans
has made them even more evil.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.200
Huh? What do you mean?

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.760
Phagogenesis.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.780
If we don't deal with them here,
many more will die!

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.560
Capture them!

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.200
I'll take the one in back.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.950
You boys will have to deal
with the two rushing us.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.980
Right!

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.660
Got it.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.360
Do not hesitate.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.790
You must fight to kill.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.780
Bring it!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.230
Ha, take this.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.900
My unblockable Thousand Punches!

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.500
That was close.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.380
You have more power than I expected.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.790
These guys are really tough.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.890
They have the hard shells of insects,
combined with human agility...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.890
What's on your mind now?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.640
He's right.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.140
I can't hesitate!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.570
First comes rock...

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.430
What?

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.250
Little boy, do you want your new
name to be Spot or Rover?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.750
Don't hesitate to kill.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.810
You'll be roving around the land of the
dead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.310
Been a while since I flipped my switch on.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.970
Snake Awakens

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.230
Damn you!

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.820
Curse you!

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.210
Take this!

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.840
Fool!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.120
This is the poisonous one!

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.780
Well?

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.440
How does it feel as the poison
spreads through your body?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.780
Does it feel good?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.960
Very effective.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.510
Once I drug him enough,
we'll have a human dog.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.020
Are you done over there?

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.720
Oh, not yet?

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.050
How...

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.980
My body is immune to poison.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.890
Ah, I see.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.370
If you behave, I'll kill you fast.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.260
Oh, well...

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.090
It just means that I was weaker.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.890
She let that cheap act fool her.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.660
What is this power flowing from his body?

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.640
Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.530
But...

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.410
What's wrong?

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.030
Are you getting scared?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.660
If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.900
The source of his power

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.500
is his fist!

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.990
He's preparing to launch an attack many...

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.680
No, dozens of times stronger than the last.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.170
Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.760
No, he's definitely going to use his fist.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.870
Then I have no choice.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.510
I'll sacrifice my eight left
legs to block his punch,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.270
while using the right eight to grab him.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.650
Then I can bite him and inject my venom!

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.380
Let's run a simulation...

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.440
This will work!

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.990
It's just a punch.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.330
No matter how strong it is,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.010
if I'm prepared, I can take it!

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.250
Hey, we should get started soon.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.770
Wait a little longer.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.380
Screw that!

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.900
You don't have a choice in the matter.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.400
Now, entertain me.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.570
Very well...

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.660
What...

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.620
Why are you here?

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.440
This is my castle.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.980
A king needs no reason to be in his castle.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.650
There are many drugs here
that emit strong odors.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.670
I would expect you to avoid this place.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.370
Shut up... I like this place!

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.900
What happened to the head of NGL?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.140
He would have been here.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.340
Beats me!

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.340
He's probably inside the Queen's belly.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.550
I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.020
Then I'll take control of the whole world.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.640
That will be impossible for a
boor who amuses himself

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.420
by making dogs of humans.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.350
Really now?

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.800
I can't wait to strip you down and
put a collar around your neck!

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.020
Damn!

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.170
Huh?

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.180
Hey! Get down here!

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.510
You only summon me when you're in trouble.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.970
You'd better watch it.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.130
I don't have time for small talk.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.380
Hurry it up.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.890
Oh, really?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.220
You're so impatient.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.220
Are you insulting me?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.300
Forget about turning you into a dog!

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.980
I'm gonna kill you!

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.440
4!

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.560
Four, huh?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.850
Damn, bad spin.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.070
What was that?

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.640
I have no bad spins, bastard!

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.920
Die!

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.280
I'll pretend to attack,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.520
while I block his punch.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.620
Then I grab him and bite.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.190
Here I go!

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.230
Rock... Paper...

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.490
Just as I thought!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.660
Block!

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.250
Scissors!

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.410
What?

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.420
A-A sword?

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.940
Impossible...

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.930
Where was he hiding that?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.840
But this could be perfect.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.870
I can pretend I've been defeated,

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.900
then wait for an opening to bite him!

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.840
You can't relax after dismembering them.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.330
The head and body can survive

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.520
an entire day after they've been separated.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.480
You must crush the head.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:09.030
And preferably, you'll kill
them quickly and quietly.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.270
Oh, it's him!

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.110
The thing that shot us.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.180
I got a slot machine in my mouth!

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.230
It goes from 1 to 9.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.350
Each number summons a different weapon.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.220
This is my Crazy Slot!

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.390
Don't forget the name!

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.140
Just go away.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.120
That's a strange power...

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.400
It talks by itself?

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.010
Apparently.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.620
If it uses a slot machine,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.270
doesn't that mean you can't
choose your weapon?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.970
Yes, and I cannot

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:49.440
change or get rid of the
weapon I receive until I use it.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.790
It's very aggravating.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.890
In that case...

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.030
Why did you come up with this power?

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.040
We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.040
Were they killed?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.880
The signal indicated three enemies,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.430
and that they looked tastier than the others.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.160
They must be rare humans.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.060
And we have cause to fight.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.840
Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.200
So the rare humans should
still be near the factory.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.810
Let's go! Tonight, we feast!

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.640
Feast!

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.080
Both of your powers are much
easier to use than mine.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.780
Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.840
Yeah.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.890
Gon, you appear to have incorporated
Enhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.720
abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.730
Yep, but my natural affinity
lies with Enhancer abilities.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.920
Killua used lightning.
Are you a Transmuter?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.480
Yeah, but it's not that strong,
and I lose energy fast.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.280
You'll have the chance to improve.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.990
Let's hurry.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.950
The nest is close.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.540
I don't get it...

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.570
I can feel power rushing into me.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.480
My body is overflowing with energy!

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.000
What is this?!

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.040
What's wrong?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.480
A signal from one of my soldiers.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.290
Rammot is acting strangely.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.630
Rammot?

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.860
Well?

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.610
Look at this!

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.660
I feel reborn!

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.240
Can you see that light, Peggy?

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.070
What tremendous life energy...

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.110
A Chimera Ant has finally
discovered the power of <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.390
Next time: Inspiration x To x Evolve.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.590
I want inspiration to evolve!

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.660
When will you evolve?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.960
Now!
