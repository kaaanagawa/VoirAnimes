WEBVTT

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.740
Ah, this is the foundation I wanted!

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.620
I also want this lipstick and manicure spray.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.740
Oh, what a cute wig...

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.050
Boss, we should get going soon.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.550
Just a little longer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.750
I should buy this camisole too.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.590
Her shopping's gonna be the death of me.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.930
I concur.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.050
A x Brutal x Battlefield

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.850
Was there anything else we needed?

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.060
Did you want anything, Eliza?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.440
No, nothing at all.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.570
I have to go to the restroom.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.790
It's okay...

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.570
Watch my stuff for me.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.850
Will Kurapika be okay?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.830
I used my flute to help him recover a little.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.960
How do you feel about the
whole assassins business?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.960
The Ten Dons are hiring professionals
to handle the Troupe.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.220
Professionals?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.720
So, Kurapika...

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.810
I want you to join those hit men.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.710
Judging by his heartbeat,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.720
he wasn't entirely pleased
about joining the hit men.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.510
Of course not.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.800
However, Kurapika is extremely determined.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.120
To achieve his goal, he's certainly
willing to sacrifice everything.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120
That's a hard road...

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.590
I couldn't do it.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.620
What's the point of a life in which
you're basically killing yourself?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.410
She's taking a long time.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.780
Once we finish this job,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.990
I'm using the money to see
the world on my bike.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.890
That sounds really nice.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.160
Not enjoying yourself is a crime.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.020
There are many ways to spend a life.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.650
Everyone has different ideas
about what's important.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.060
Huh?

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.900
What's wrong?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.900
She's gone!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.550
Huh?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.650
What?!

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.910
Daddy's such a liar!

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.240
He wasn't going to take me to the auction!

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.610
Fine, I'll just go by myself!

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.760
Come in.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.040
Forever Active

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.270
One, two, three, four, five, six...

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.530
Looks like everyone's here.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.650
No, not yet.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.280
I thought the team only had eight members.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.810
Nostrade is sending an additional person.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.790
Tsk, the guy who uses that
voodoo fortunetelling?

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.300
Then, has everyone arrived?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.060
The job is to annihilate the Phantom Troupe.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.560
When the auction kicks off again,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.060
they may show up.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.560
If they do, dispose of them.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.710
You're free to use any means you want.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.570
This team will be after the same target.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800
We should decide how we address
each other when communicating.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.280
Just use colors.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.080
Call me Blue.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.080
I'll be Red.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.580
It's like playing a game.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.730
Eh? What about you guys?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.820
Silva.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.850
I'm Zeno.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.180
Zeno? What color is that?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.230
We will both use our real names.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.340
What?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.240
You're welcome to call me by name,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.710
but I won't take orders.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.350
We'll do this our own way.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.860
Silva and Zeno...

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.850
Of the Zoldyck family?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.360
Let me know if you want someone killed.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.610
I'm willing to give you a thirty percent
discount for being in the same line of work.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.530
They're from Killua's family.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.620
Does it really matter

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.700
what we call one another?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.110
Agreed.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.250
There's no requirement we work together.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.710
But we're talking about the Troupe.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.740
Attacking alone will be dangerous.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.920
And you?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.920
Shaky teamwork will only cause confusion.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.700
I will move alone.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.540
So it's 5 to 4.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.770
We have our answer.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.310
The auction begins at nine.
We will transport you to the auction hall.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.030
Please wait here until it's time.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.430
Yo, Nostrade...

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.040
How are you feeling?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.310
Not too bad.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.450
Not too bad?

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.160
You've gotten pretty full of yourself.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.320
Not too long ago, you were just
leading a little country gang,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.670
and now you're acting like my equal.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.850
I hear you've been rubbing your hands
together so much, your skin rubbed off.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.150
You okay?

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.680
It's sad when a man shows jealousy.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.310
Bastard!

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.550
What's this about?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.820
Go ahead and stick that knife in me!

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.570
Kurapika, that's enough!

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.090
Let's be clear...
No one's impressed by you!

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.780
Many people envy my success,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.390
while they ignore their own failings.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.090
However, I intend to continue to rise.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.180
By using Neon's fortunetelling.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.250
I expect great things from you.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.210
You will be appropriately rewarded
when the time comes.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.750
Yes.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.860
The police are cooperating?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.560
Sixty percent of the votes

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.270
in the Yorknew City mayoral
election were bought.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.870
And the police chief is the mayor's protégé.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.800
Redirecting traffic is quite easy for us.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.300
Hello?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.830
Kurapika, it's terrible.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.150
The boss ran away!

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.360
She changed clothes in the restroom,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.380
so she must have planned ahead.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.320
Then I can guess where she's going.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.890
Return to the hotel and stand by.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.990
What's wrong?

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.030
Your daughter's run away.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.910
What?!

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.400
We probably have the same destination.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.320
The auction?

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.660
Damn, she's turned off her phone.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.710
But Neon doesn't have a pass...

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.410
She'll be turned away at the gate.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.870
This is Light Nostrade!

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.660
I need you to convey an order
to all the guards at the gate!

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.180
If a girl about seventeen or
eighteen arrives with no pass,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.410
they should take her into custody!

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.670
Her description...

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.180
Okay, please go ahead.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.180
Whew,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.840
I was stuck without a way
to get past that gate.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.430
Thank you so much.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.850
You're very welcome.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.440
Really?! When was that?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.460
About five minutes ago...

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.690
Her hair and attire were slightly
different, but it was probably her.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.860
She didn't have a pass?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.830
She didn't appear to realize that
the auction required a pass.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.580
She mentioned something about
her daddy, but then she left.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.090
Yes, she got in a taxi alone.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.590
Yes, goodbye.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.090
Nice work.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.710
Neon, where have you gone?

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.420
I'll search for her.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.350
Do you have a map of the city?

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.810
I've heard that you're a good fortuneteller.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.770
Huh?

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.630
Someone once mentioned it to me.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.370
I can't remember who...

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.780
I'm good.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.780
Important people request
my services all the time.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.110
What's your accuracy?

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.250
They say I'm always right.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.080
They say?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.630
Aren't you the one telling the fortunes?

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.510
My hand moves on its own.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.380
Oh, how impressive.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.180
Would you tell me mine?

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.050
Sure.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.390
Write your full name, date of birth,
and blood type on a sheet of paper.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.310
Will this work?

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.400
Let me see.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.360
Chrollo Lucilfer...

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.800
That's a strange name.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.320
My friends call me "boss."

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.150
What?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.600
That's even stranger!

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.910
Then, I'll tell your fortune.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.930
Your daughter is already in the
Cemetery Building on the auction site.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.490
What? But how?!

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.930
Regardless, we should hurry.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.940
Okay, all done.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.360
May I have a look?

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.810
Sure.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.760
My fortunes are a little strange.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.540
They usually have four or five verses.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.700
Each one corresponds to
a week of the month,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.380
so the first may have already happened.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.800
Oh...

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.860
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.780
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.670
The mourners play a melody,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.730
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.550
Amazing.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.990
It's correct.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.090
About this first verse...

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.060
Huh?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.250
Oh, stop...

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.060
I never look at the fortunes I write.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.660
Why not?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.240
I have a feeling they're more accurate
if I stay away from them.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.110
Then may I ask you a question?

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.570
Uh-huh.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.320
This verse refers to a requiem for the dead.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.820
Do you believe in the afterlife?

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.640
Hmm...

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.830
Not really.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.960
My fortunes are for people who are alive.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.050
Like you, Chrollo-san.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.740
I'm guessing that the requiem

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.550
is meant to help you, not the dead.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.100
You're probably right.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.460
Let's go.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.590
They'll let us start browsing
at the auction soon.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.860
Actually, I heard that from someone else.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.240
Eh?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.610
When I was little, I saw a
fortuneteller on TV say that.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.190
That fortunes were meant to
make the living happy.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.870
Really?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.860
So the fortuneteller tried to
avoid giving negative fortunes.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.130
Negative fortunes?

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.670
The idea was

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.900
to encourage people to wish for and
work toward better things.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.140
At the time, I was really moved...

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.730
From then on, I wanted to be a fortuneteller.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.590
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.650
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.910
The mourners play a melody,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.800
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.800
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.230
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.330
But you will remain supreme.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.460
Even after losing half your limbs.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.270
Enjoy the interlude.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.290
Search out new allies.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.830
East is the direction to go.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.620
You will find one who awaits you.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.190
A few years later, that fortuneteller
was arrested for being a con artist.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.690
Are you talking about the Galactic Grandma?

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.930
Yep!

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.560
I remember that she didn't
believe in the afterlife.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.450
Right, so that's why I don't, either.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.640
Personally, I believe in ghosts.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.460
Huh?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:04.570
And that's why I'll do as he
would have wanted.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.720
What do you mean?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.430
Go wild.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.850
Are you okay?

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.150
Call a doctor!

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.860
We're on the first floor,
by the north elevator.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.610
Someone's ill. Call an ambulance.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.640
We can't.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.490
They won't let an ambulance
inside without a pass.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:32.880
What did you say?

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.160
What if the unthinkable happens?!

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.850
This is the daughter of the
Nostrade Family boss!

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.170
Will you take responsibility for her life?!

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.200
Tsk, got it.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.550
She has fans among the Ten Dons.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.530
Fine, we'll make it happen.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.340
Hey, call for an ambulance!

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.290
Got it.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.580
Are you able to rewind this monitor?

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.420
Huh? Yeah.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.610
That chop was incredibly fast...

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.700
Only I could have caught it.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.450
It's been a while since I was this excited.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.450
There is my prey.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.720
Nostrade-sama, your daughter is

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.710
resting in room 501, on the fifth floor.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.220
She shouldn't have been able to secure a pass...

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.090
How did she get in?

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.330
Your daughter's picture is on the Hunter website.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.290
What?

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.650
Most likely, someone found
this picture on the site,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.900
approached her, and then brought her here.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.020
I'll find that person and kill him!

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.240
Please remain calm.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.490
I don't believe capturing your
daughter was their objective.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.210
She may have been a hostage in case they
had trouble infiltrating the building.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.160
It's dangerous here.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.220
I called Melody and Basho.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.800
They should arrive soon.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.010
Can I trust them?

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.300
You should go with them.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.280
But the auction...

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.360
There won't be one.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.010
This place will become a battlefield.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.880
The auction will be postponed again.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.230
A trail of blood.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.890
He wants to be found...

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.030
By leaving a scent that only another killer

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.990
would catch.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.470
You are just like me.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.790
We are the same.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.800
Addicted to murder.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.200
Relax.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.040
I won't use any cheap tricks.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.810
Let's play one-on-one.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.260
Yeah.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.310
I have a message from the boss.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.570
He wants to go wild in the Cemetery
Building, so we should come.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.260
We aren't too far away.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.680
What about everyone else?

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.860
The rest had the same idea.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.700
They've been cleaning up the trash,
while approaching the building.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.800
Okay, then let's go.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.050
Also, the boss actually added a rule this time.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.710
A rule? What?

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.930
Go absolutely crazy.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.030
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.280
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.850
The mourners play a melody,

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.800
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.630
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.120
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.100
But you will remain supreme.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.610
Even after losing half your limbs.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.610
Enjoy the interlude.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.710
Search out new allies.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.840
East is the direction to go.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.870
You will find one who awaits you.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.880
Why?

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:58.890
Why?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.200
Why am I still alive?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.260
This is known as an Indoor Fish.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.120
Made from <i>Nen</i>, it can only
exist in enclosed spaces.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.040
It's a carnivore that enjoys human flesh.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.540
Its victims don't bleed or feel pain.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.910
And they won't die until the
Indoor Fish disappears.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.060
Won't die...

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.300
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.580
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.780
The mourners play a melody,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.960
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.300
Uvo-san,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.180
can you hear us?

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.030
We are playing a requiem for you.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.450
It was the start of a stormy night,

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.730
fierce and drenched with blood,
yet somehow overwhelmingly sad.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:15.920
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.420
Today, we introduce Phinks.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.830
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.370
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.810
He's an Enhancer.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.540
An Enhancer.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.310
He's strong enough to punch through a body.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.920
The greater the windup,
the stronger his punch.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.250
Sometimes, he dresses like an Egyptian mummy.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.880
It's his name.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.420
Next time: Assault x And x Impact.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.400
Oh, Gon...

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.090
Wherefore art thou Gon?!

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.010
Killua, that's because

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.860
I'm Gon!

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.490
That's it?
