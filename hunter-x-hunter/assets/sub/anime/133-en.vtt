00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
After challenging Meruem to a
contest in order to buy time,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.050
Pouf was now scattering scales on the
citizens who were not yet hypnotized.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.490
I must hurry or Meruem-sama
will remember that woman...

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.590
We haven't moved forward at all.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.000
What's going on up ahead?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.170
Shh, no talking!

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.990
What are you talking about?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.430
The soldiers are held up in the back.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.480
I heard all their commanders have
collapsed, one after another...

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.780
Like puppets whose strings have been cut.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.070
There haven't been any warnings
about stepping out of line anymore.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.990
I keep hearing loud noises
coming from the palace...

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.020
Something is weird!

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.020
Maybe...

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.200
It's a coup d'état?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.700
After giving the King 6/7 of my body,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.120
I've lost a lot of my power.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520
The scales aren't scattering well.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.720
And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.010
Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.140
Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.480
The boy didn't look to be that strong.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250
I cannot use my clones while
I'm scattering my scales.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.500
But I need to hurry and kill the woman.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.130
Whatever it takes...

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.740
This is my final chance!

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.960
Deadline x To x Live

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.020
Palm, take the four women still here with you.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.230
They didn't run away?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.320
No.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.530
Use duct tape to bind their
hands and cover their eyes.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.910
If they see me, it'll take too long to explain.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.490
That's true... I understand.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.590
Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.130
A messenger?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.650
You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.600
that the woman is in the underground warehouse.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.140
Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.450
Once that's done, you're free.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.140
It's probably a trap, right?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.650
That's what I'll tell the King.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.580
If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.900
Yeah.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.260
Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the
enemy's bidding may anger the King.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.010
I'm not gonna dig my own grave.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.920
Fine, I'll try it.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.030
Can you drive?

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.550
Better than you.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.430
It's important that he carries out his mission.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.350
Perhaps I should keep an eye on him,
even if it means losing Pouf...

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.120
Palm.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.440
It's okay.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.300
Welfin,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.520
once this is over, you're free.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.680
Go and see Gyro.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.780
Don't get too cocky!

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.340
I'll kill you!

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.250
Don't you dare speak his name!

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.840
You would never understand!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.090
I understand, Zaikahal.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.780
How...

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.990
How do you know

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.640
my former...

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.350
I didn't tell anyone.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.650
I probably won't ever remember my former name,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.870
but we were buddies.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.240
Buddies?

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.880
Before we were Ants.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.830
They're our enemies.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.560
Enemies of NGL.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.540
Am I wrong?

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.990
Brovada has forgotten his past,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.110
but he was also one of us.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.320
Take him with you.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.640
Ikalgo...

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.490
How do you know?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.010
What do you mean?

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.410
You told me to go see Gyro.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.020
You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.350
Yeah, that's true.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.020
But...

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.270
I don't know that he's alive.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.520
I just can't believe otherwise.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.030
Since we all "survived."

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.030
He couldn't have just been digested.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.540
Damn it... Damn it!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.810
Damn it!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.960
Are you sure about this, Pouf?

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.140
Ten minutes have passed, and I don't
see any sign of Pitou returning...

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.090
Get out.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.300
Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.310
Once you're outside, you'll understand
the current situation.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.760
I hate to admit it...

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.650
But Ikalgo's right.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.360
Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.020
Which means they're the enemy.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.440
I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.880
I'll be his messenger!

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.290
Stop!

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.660
Youpi-dono?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.520
I already found a Royal Guard.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.950
Youpi-dono...

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.820
I have a message that must be
taken to the King immediately.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.090
The underground warehouse?

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.960
Yes.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.430
And they're looking to exchange

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.350
the woman for their allies that
have been taken hostage?

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.280
Yes.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.280
Please tell the King at once.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.470
Got it... I'm on it.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.470
Right...

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.870
We're having a contest, so I
don't need to tell the King.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.040
If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.600
You can go.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.200
Yes, sir.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.580
Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.010
Still, what's Pitou doing right now?

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.940
Chimera Ants are the enemy.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.650
Gyro's enemy...

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.580
Our enemy!

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.670
Youpi-dono!

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.050
I have a question!

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.700
What is it?

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.740
Do you have any memories of your former life?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.700
Memories from before you
became a Chimera Ant?

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.960
No, of course not.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.210
I am the Royal Guard Youpi.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.570
I've never been anyone else.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.470
Don't ask me stupid questions!

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.300
Youpi-dono...

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.560
Hey! That's enough—

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.500
If you attack me, I'll fight back.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.110
I have a few questions for you.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.560
You have five seconds to answer.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.230
Don't get too cocky, you little punk!

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.570
Contest...

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.410
Contest...

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.600
Something is missing...

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.050
Marshal

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.240
Marshal

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.060
Marshal

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.700
Yes...

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.990
I was

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.700
battling someone.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.580
Someone

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.430
that I have yet to defeat

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.690
a single time...

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.760
That took much longer than expected.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.760
By now, Pitou must have returned...

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.010
I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.940
Where's Youpi?

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.560
Where has Youpi gone?

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.240
What's that?

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.840
Youpi?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.540
I-It can't be...

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.200
We're okay now...

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.330
What do you mean, Palm?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.530
King! Meruem-sama!

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.370
Youpi has been killed.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.570
There are still skilled enemies around!

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.330
Where's Pitou?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.330
Oh, Pitou hasn't returned...

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.040
Then...

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.740
I can now begin, yes?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.460
W-Wait, Meruem-sama!

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.340
The situation has changed...

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.750
It's too dangerous! The contest is—

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.250
The contest is off?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.650
That means I have won.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.820
Tell me everything you know.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.990
Is that acceptable?

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.110
We're okay now?

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.460
What do you mean, Palm?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.320
Killua deduced that she is special to the King.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.380
But the Royal Guard is divided...

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.900
That is because

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.880
Pitou tried to save and protect her,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.150
while Pouf tried to kill her.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.070
In other words,

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.560
she is a double-edged sword for the King.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.550
I find that hard to believe.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.160
It's impossible

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.570
for the Royal Guard to bicker
and defy the King's will!

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.140
Is it?

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.870
Then why are you and I here now?

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.080
Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.750
to side with humans?

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.580
Adding humans to the gene pool

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.960
has led to many events that would be
impossible for normal Chimera Ants.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.500
Can you be certain that I'm wrong?

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.650
Sorry...

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.020
My point is that

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.740
the division among the Royal Guard
may not necessarily contradict

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.610
their loyalty to the King.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.880
There is a human that the
King cares deeply about.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.010
"We must protect that human."

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.090
"We must kill that human."

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.620
Both reactions make sense.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.380
For now, I'll concede that point to you.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.560
Why does that mean we're okay now?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.880
Twenty minutes have passed
since the initial wave of <i>En</i>.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:57.180
But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.810
I don't get it...

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.650
What's going on here?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.800
When the <i>En</i> was used, I was carrying this girl.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.420
If the King had noticed,

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.660
he would have come straight to me.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.910
He didn't because I had
concealed her within my hair.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.910
It's possible that he didn't realize
I was carrying another person.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.130
Are you following me?

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.130
It seems logical, so I can't argue that...

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.680
But I still don't see your point.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:40.060
If she's covered up, the King
can't find her with his <i>En</i>.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.880
Are you suggesting

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.190
that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die,
rather than make an exchange?

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.770
Of course not...

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.330
We'll offer to make an exchange.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.640
But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.890
To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.700
where the King cannot find her.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.920
Buy time? How long are we talking?

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.730
Until the King dies.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.990
What is she talking about?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.940
Until the King dies?

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.120
Sure, he has to die sometime...

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.290
But if we knew when he'd die,
we wouldn't have a problem!

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.140
Why are we okay now?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.090
Give me a proper explanation!

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.000
The King will die, and it will happen soon.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.530
Within the next few hours,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.350
the King will die!

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.280
We need to go deeper...

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.950
Yes, we must put her in a place
where only we can find her.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.230
That should do it.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.810
All that's left is to negotiate,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.380
without going far enough to make the King snap.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:46.790
I know...

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.250
What we're doing is cruel.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.210
We are no different from them.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.530
No...

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.330
We are far worse!

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.350
Pitou... Pitou...

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.310
Where are you?

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.940
Pitou!

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.680
Next time: The Word x Is x That Someone.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.030
And it isn't "Killua."

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.270
And that's all there is to it.
