WEBVTT

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.250
How—

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.180
Stop.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.220
...did you know?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.820
What am I asking that for?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.180
It's time.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.760
Adding interest.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.000
The Strong x And x The Weak

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.760
The time has finally come.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.350
At long last...

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.280
Yep.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930
The King is about to be born!

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.410
Wait...

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.300
It's too early!

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.420
Silence!

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.070
I hunger.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.010
Bring me food.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.260
Th-This is our King...

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.050
Your Majesty!

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.740
O-Oh, no...

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.330
Her organs are severely damaged!

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.200
Do not make me repeat myself.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.010
Bring me food.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.200
This is a filthy place...

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.970
You...

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.230
Clean this off.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.630
Ah, I happen to have a handkerchief on me—

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.460
Do not make me repeat myself.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.080
I am speaking to you.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.260
Clean this off.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.330
Disgusting.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.010
Where is my food?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.120
This way, please.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.610
We have prepared a meal for you.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.930
The three of us will serve
as your arms and legs.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.180
We shall acquire anything you wish...

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.810
And fulfill all of your desires.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.310
We await your command.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.750
Help the Queen!

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.420
Stop the bleeding!

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.050
Well? How is she?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.110
It looks grim...

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.600
She's in very bad shape.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.870
Multiple organs have been crushed
so badly, we cannot heal them!

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.360
If something isn't done...

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.610
Neferpitou-dono!

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.390
The Queen is dying...

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.870
We require your assistance!

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.600
We need the power you
used to heal that man!

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.500
I only healed him because I need him.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.890
Now that the King has been born,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.390
she means nothing to the Royal Guard.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.650
She is no longer necessary.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.040
Your Majesty!

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.960
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.640
Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.130
No, Neferpitou-dono has...

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.230
No...

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.090
They have all abandoned the Queen.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.880
Abandoned?

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.080
We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.110
It's impossible!

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.590
Weren't you listening to me?

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.160
We don't have the power

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.210
to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.600
Perhaps they have the power we need.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.350
Who are you talking about?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.110
Hey, where are you going?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.400
We have prepared your dinner on the roof,
where there is a fine view.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.200
Then, it would seem faster
to get there from outside.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.500
Magnificent...

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.160
Excuse me.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.680
That looks fun...

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.960
It seems I need practice.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.790
Disgusting.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.540
You don't like it?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.990
It is horrendously bland.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.350
We haven't been seasoning our food...

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.600
No, that is not what I mean.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.450
When I was in her belly,

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.610
I was occasionally treated to
wonderfully rich, savory meals.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.360
Ah, you must be talking
about the rare humans.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.020
My body longs for that
indescribable satisfaction.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.360
I wish to feast upon one of them.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.120
As you wish.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.470
In that case...

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.680
One of them is heading straight for us.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.010
Have we been seen?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.560
Let's hide...

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.180
Wait.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.190
Something seems off...

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.020
Look!

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.990
A white flag?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.040
We surrender!

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.970
We surrender!

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.050
But there is one condition...

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.490
You must save the Queen!

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.560
She no longer has the ability to give birth.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.760
The Queen?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.310
The King has already been born!

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.330
Impossible!

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.560
It's too early!

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.000
He is...

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.670
They are all

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.250
devils...

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.010
What is this?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.380
They put up no fight.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.370
Disgusting.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.550
This is all wrong.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.220
Might I offer some advice?

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.820
The brain is the most delicious part of a human.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.630
So I'd recommend dispatching your
prey without harming the head.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.480
Is that so?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.860
Like this?

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.680
Magnificent!

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.720
I see... This is not so bad.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.730
However...

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.480
It is still inedible,
when compared to a rare human.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.480
Might I offer more advice?

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.970
There is a way to identify rare humans.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.070
If you use—

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.490
Do you insult me?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.770
I am aware

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.780
that if I focus, I can see the
energy around their bodies.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.000
The volume of energy reveals their strength.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.510
Please forgive my insolence.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.020
Simply finding and consuming
them is not entertaining.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.160
I enjoy the moments before eating,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.520
before it is clear whether
the human is rare or not.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.830
Since I have already alleviated my hunger.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.530
Incidentally, Pitou...

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.570
You are quite strong.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.120
I was trying to kill you.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.530
You have earned my respect.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.040
I am unworthy.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.540
I don't believe it...

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.570
He ate a soldier... One of his own.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.180
That isn't entirely correct.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.550
He is a completely different organism.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.560
I imagine he views all other creatures as food.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.290
So what should we do now?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.240
What do you mean?

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.680
If the Queen dies, we'll lose
our reason to stay here.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.760
Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.080
The Queen can no longer reproduce.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.170
Huh?

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.130
That's true.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.850
It's no longer possible for the
Queen to build her kingdom.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.090
In that case, each of us should
try to become a king...

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.590
We can do as we please.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.450
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.350
You think you can get away with this?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.360
I'm sure we aren't the only ones
who'd like to leave this place.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.980
W-Wait...

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.580
Now do you see that you're in the minority?

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.390
Please... There's no time!

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.200
If the Queen dies,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.090
there will be nothing to hold
the Squadron Leaders back.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.640
Things will spin out of control.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.980
What exactly will happen then?

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.150
Most likely, they will imitate the King.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.650
They will leave to build their own
kingdoms by spreading their seed.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.560
If the chain of command collapses,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.780
some of the Captains will also strike out alone.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.910
They will scatter throughout the world
and destroy entire ecosystems.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.620
Are Chimera Ant soldiers
capable of reproduction?

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.700
Yes...

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.670
They can copulate with females
of other species and reproduce.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.970
Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.800
will not attempt to reproduce.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.920
But I've read reports

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.770
of soldiers attempting to reproduce
following a queen's death.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.570
Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.570
What's your name?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.570
Colt.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.370
Colt, we're going to take you to our boss.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.730
I need you to tell your story to him directly.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.090
However,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.710
I don't know if he will trust you.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.090
And even if he believes your story,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.100
he may not let you leave alive.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.600
Are you still willing to come with us?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.810
Absolutely! Time is of the essence!

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.240
The timing couldn't be worse.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.870
Today is the day our disciples fight it out...

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.120
Oh! I completely forgot...

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.210
I bet 100,000 that Knuckle
and Shoot would make it.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.150
You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come...

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.380
Knuckle...

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.150
Huh?

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.740
Promise me!

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.820
You have to...

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.590
You have to save Kite!

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.820
Got it...

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.670
I promise I'll bring him back.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.670
Rook

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.680
I swear on this token.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.670
Killua...

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.920
I'm weak...

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.660
I never knew...

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.750
I never knew

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.980
how frustrating

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.460
weakness could be!

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.580
Gon...

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.340
<i>For the thirty days that you can't use</i> Nen...

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.340
I'll protect you.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.590
I will do whatever it takes!

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.470
After that,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.700
it's goodbye.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.340
Next time: One Wish x And x Two Promises.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.990
Hey, a shooting star!

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.180
May we always be together!
