WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
These suction cups saved me.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.650
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.980
Don—

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.990
Ikalgo x And x Lightning

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.740
A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he
and Gon split up to stop the selection.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.170
One of them is Ikalgo,
an octopus Chimera Ant.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.750
Aren't you an octopus?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.800
Don't call me an octopus!

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510
See ya!

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.010
I need to find a new host, or
I can't charge up my next shot.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.010
I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.060
Yo, we meet again.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.100
So we do...

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.130
Long time, no see!

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.060
Ya know?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.930
Can I ask you something?

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.000
Sure, go ahead!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.700
Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.390
You should have an advantage in the water.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.210
Don't tell me you can't swim.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.940
Uh, well...

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.080
It's the blood, right?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.780
When they smell blood, your
buddies in the water go berserk

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.930
and attack the injured, no matter who it is.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.740
With those wounds, if you went in there,
you'd be torn to shreds.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.510
Am I wrong?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.990
Uh, w-well...

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.980
I suppose that's one way to...

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.530
Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.490
No, we're still fighting!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.240
Who are you talking to?

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.240
I screwed up!

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.340
Right, you all can communicate via telepathy.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.160
Talking to your boss? It's that guy
who was flying over me, right?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.970
Wait, now look here...

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.990
Uh, so...

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.280 line:20%
Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.510
You could say that's what I might be doing...

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.510 line:20%
Yes! We're still fighting!

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.990
Oh, sorry to interrupt you.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.760
Let me know if you learn anything.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.680
If he sees dozens of dragonflies
flying around inside a cave,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.220
the enemy would get suspicious...

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.020
I won't be able to send my
Satellite Dragonflies inside.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250
Let's make a deal, then.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.860
If you tell me about his power,
I'll spare your life.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.780
You have ten seconds to answer.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.670
Eight seconds left.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.970
Six seconds.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.970
I wanted to be reborn a squid...

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.880
I would've given anything to have
been a <i>Chiroteuthis imperator</i>.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.420
Do you think octopi and squid are similar?

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.330
If so, you're mistaken...

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.200
Octopi are ugly.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.250
Squid are squidderific.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.520
I think they look divine!

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.340
Two seconds.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.700
I won't betray a buddy!

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.210
Yeah, I could see that in your eyes.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.650
I can only hope

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.720
that in my next life, I'll be born a squid...

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.240
Wh—

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.690
Why?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.620
Because you're a cool guy.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.130
In different circumstances,
we could've been friends.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.930
You lowered your guard!

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.310
Didn't think fish could jump, eh?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.650
I'll crush you and the rock behind you!

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.880
Come in, Ikalgo.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.930
Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.630
Has he used any weapons or special abilities?

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.950
Ikalgo!

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.640
No, he's been fighting...

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.870
with only his bare hands.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.630
Come on... Beg for your life.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.720
Otherwise, it's no fun!

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.050
Or are you in too much pain to talk?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.680
Yeah, this is a relief.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.940
Huh?

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.610
Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.640
Huh?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.190
I have no qualms about killing you.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.290
Yep! He was just a scumbag!

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.450
That's why he was the decoy!

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.980
I did it, Ortho-sama!

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.990
I've attached the badge!

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.760
Coburn pulled it off!

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.570
Time to start the game.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.850
Let's enjoy ourselves.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.590
Damn, the bleeding won't stop...

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.150
I need to find an exit.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.270
A digital sound inside my head?

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.270
Wha—

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.110
What?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.620
A fish? But I'm not in the water!

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.590
What's going on?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.090
I didn't sense anything!

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.280
Again...

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.130
I didn't see anything or sense any
aura until the fish hit me!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.900
What's going on?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.640
This is bad.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.080
I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.650
108 points.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.640
You have no idea what's going on?

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.960
I should say that you're
hearing my voice in your head.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.660
Well, if you survive long enough,
you'll figure out what's happening.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.360
<i>These are fish made from</i> Nen.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.240
So why can't I sense them?

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.510
Something must be triggering
them from somewhere else.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.430
That's the only possible explanation!

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.560
How else could I be attacked by
something I can't see or sense?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.980
This is going well...

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.370
Well, have you determined
anything about these attacks?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.880
Three...

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.590
He can only materialize three fish at once.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.230
After that, the fish will disappear.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.770
And the vivid colors of the
target he put on me...

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.310
It can only mean one thing!

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.350
Your power involves

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.730
darts!

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.400
Bingo.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.740
That's correct.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.690
But the great thing about our power
is that figuring it out won't help you.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.190
Because my <i>Nen</i> fish darts

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.370
have no physical form until the
instant they pierce your flesh.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.950
That makes it impossible to block them.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.480
Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.960
I have a dart board

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.960
that's linked to various parts of your body.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.250
For instance...

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.240
Your right elbow is 27 points.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.480
Your right hand is 18 points.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.120
99 points...

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.930
Hey, what's wrong?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.950
I can't hear your screams.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.770
Are you already dead?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.820
The game's only just begun.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.490
Triple 6!

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.720
4!

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.660
13!

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.940
Bravo!

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.680
Brother, that was magnificent.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.130
You're on a roll.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.500
Naturally...

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.770
Our lives are on the line...

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.510
This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.790
The sister creates a <i>Nen</i> badge,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.710
which activates after it's affixed to the target.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.260
That links the target to the dart
board created by the brother.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.560
Until the game ends, no one
can deactivate the badge,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.970
not even the Ortho Siblings.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.270
When the brother's darts hit the board,
the target is attacked by needlefish.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.630
There is no way to avoid this attack.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.410
That is because, until they've
hit the target's body,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.280
the needlefish do not exist.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.540
Thus, it is impossible to sense
them coming or dodge them.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.200
This is our unbeatable power...

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.720
Needlefish De Darts!

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.190
Death Games

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.530
Death Games
<font size="18">Needlefish De Darts</c>

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.710
Of course, the siblings incur some risk.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.880
Once the badge activates, they are invincible.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.070
But if the brother misses the board with the
final dart that decides the game's outcome,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.520
all of the damage the target has taken

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.440
will transfer to the siblings.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.190
We are invincible. That is because...

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.240
We are bound by the
strongest trust in the world.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.000
It isn't over yet...

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.960
Well, it seems the game's almost over.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.870
Why don't you tell him that?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.310
No need to be that nice.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:40.470
If he were pleading for his life,
it'd be easier for me to focus.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.350
Or if he were to give up
and beg me to kill him,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:50.480
or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero
and said, "Not a bad way to die."

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.770
Those would help motivate me,
as I toss my darts.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.490
But he'll just have to dread his impending
death, never knowing when it will end...

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.390
Until he dies.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.420
It's not...

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.430
It's not over yet!

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.500
Damn...

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.570
This looks pretty bad...

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.930
I've lost way too much blood.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.200
I could die here,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.940
so no point in saving what's left.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.430
Now, then.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.520
It's my final turn.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.320
Left ear.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.620
That sure gave him a big earring.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.000
Right calf!

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.420
Okay, time for the last throw.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.920
My brother, I trust you.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.610
I've got this.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.950
See?

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.960
Bravo!

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.820
Yay!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.820
Yay!

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.330
Yay!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.460
You're the best in the world!

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.520
I'll go check his corpse.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.970
I'll come with you.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.520
We should share some of the
meat with Coburn as a reward.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.730
Aren't you gonna eat?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.830
Can I ask you something?

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.740
What?

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.780
What made you decide to trust me?

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.600
It wasn't that I didn't trust you.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.150
I just didn't know why you were following me.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.370
And you swore that you weren't lying.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.500
Huh?! That's it?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.510
Isn't that enough?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.530
Hell, no!

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.610
Liars make promises all the time!

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.060
A promise is the one thing
you should never trust!

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.890
Then you were lying?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.620
I'm different...

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.010
I don't lie!

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.020
I only tell the truth!

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.510
Then it's okay.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.000
I think I'm starting to lose it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.780
He's strong, but he's just a kid.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.300
I'm putting my fate in the
hands of this clueless boy?

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.540
Besides, if you're lying, that'll
actually make things easier for me.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.540
Easier?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
I won't have to show you any mercy.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.390
I'll be free to destroy you.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.910
The look... The look in the kid's eyes...

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:16.240
Yes, this is why I had a hunch...

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.970
There's something special about this kid.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.290
I can't even tell how much
power he really has...

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.870
You hit him right in the forehead.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.000
Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.560
Really? That's excellent.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.060
I will tell Leol-sama that a
promotion is in order.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.880
Thank you very much.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.340
Great!

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.940
We can be assistant squadron leaders now!

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.660
Yay!

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.290
Yay!

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.670
Yay!

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.540
H-How?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.650
How can you be alive with a dart
sticking out of your brain?!

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.010
What?

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.910
It's a suction cup from an octopus.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.090
No way.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.470
How did you manage that trick?

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.220
No, wait...

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.420
My... My darts were perfect!

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.630
It's absolutely impossible to stop them!

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.480
Yeah, I didn't stop it.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.180
I just grabbed it,

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.990
the moment it materialized at my head.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.970
From what you were saying, I could tell

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.190
you could hear my voice,
but you couldn't see me.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:47.240
I had plenty of time to switch out
the needle for a suction cup.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.010
H-Hold on...

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:57.110
No human has reflexes fast
enough to catch a dart!

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.440
Well, it wouldn't have been possible had
I not known where it would appear.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.460
But I knew exactly where and
when the last dart would hit.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:16.260
The final dart must hit the board's
outer ring per double out rules.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.660
And you were playing an 01—501 game.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.020
You start with 501 points,
and the goal is to reach 0.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.490
These rules are used in professional competition.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.930
I n-never told you what rules I was using!

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.210
As soon as I knew you were playing darts,
my suspicions were confirmed.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.500
Remember how

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.320
your first dart hit double 4?

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.680
The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.230
A double in...

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.200
A sign that you were confident in your skill.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.290
A skilled player would play by official rules.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.520
Players with talent and confidence
tend to seek public recognition.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.520
After that, I just had to do the
math and endure the pain.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.490
I subtracted your points from 501,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.750
and waited until your score was under 40.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.280
At that point,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.950
I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.790
That's all it took.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:30.160
To improve his reflexes, Killua changed
his aura into electricity.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.430
When the dart touched his skin,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.460
the sensation did not travel

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.630
from his skin to his brain
using the nervous system.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.060
He used <i>Nen</i> to ensure that, as soon
as the aura registered the dart,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.690
it sent a message directly to his
left hand, to grab the dart.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.690
Do you have some history with darts?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.760
At age six, I mastered the game.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.310
I've counted down from 1,440 points.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.450
It was part of my early training.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.440
It's your fault for getting cocky
and talking too much!

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.440
Or was I seven?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.240
You're so stupid!

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.550
Guess it doesn't matter...

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.880
Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.610
I talked too long.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.210
I need to hurry!

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.720
Huh?

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.700
What?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.990
My body won't do what I tell it to...

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.490
Wait, is this really happening?

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.690
Wow...

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.610
All this is my blood?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.760
It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.570
Wait, this isn't the time to think about that...

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.360
I should get going.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.520
Crap... Now I feel cold...

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.320
Damn...

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.610
And after that last fight gave me a hint...

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.010
for improving my power.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.630
Am I...

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.840
going to die here?

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.740
Gon... Sorry...

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:35.360
I wasn't any... help...

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.250
Octopus...

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.190
Don't call me an octopus!

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.510
What are you doing?

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.850
Isn't that obvious?

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.800
I'm turning traitor.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.220
Lame, huh?

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.950
Now stop talking.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.340
I know a secret doctor.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.270
It won't take long by underground waterway.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.220
Don't die before we get there!

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.450
Are you an idiot?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.210
I spared... your life...

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.740
Now they'll be hunting you...

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.820
I know that!

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.470
Don't ask me why I'm doing this.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.660
But you know...

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.560
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.510
After you said we could be friends...

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.240
I couldn't let you die!

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.370
I'm gonna save you!

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.050
Don't die on me!

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.220
Next time: Power x And x Games.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.460
If you smoke, your teeth will turn black.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.720
I'm a chameleon, so I don't have teeth!
