WEBVTT

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.480
All right!

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.090
We made it through!

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.980
Good work!

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.690
I think we've gone five kilometers today.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.670
At first, I thought it would take years,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.240
but at this pace...

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.930
Masadora!

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.810
Take two!

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.830
Okay!

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.970
Let's return to the starting point now.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400
Again?!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.040
Strengthen x And x Threaten

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.170
Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.640
You have the requisite physical strength
to defeat every enemy here.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.150
What you lack

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.190
is the ability to come up with
a plan of attack as you fight.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.190
In other words, the ability to strategize.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.910
The ability to...

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.320
...strategize.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.170
I'm not going to say a single word,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.820
so devise your own means
to defeat the monsters.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.080
Still, the people who made this
game really were special...

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.540
The game's programmed in such a way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.390
that you're guaranteed to get
stronger as you progress.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.590
And, most likely, all for the purpose

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.080
of making him stronger.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.630
Yes!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.550
I got the Marimo-chi!

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.150
</i>Nen<i> battles require one to fight
against many different enemy types.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.790
The ability to think on your feet

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.660
is the most critical technique.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.540
First, get used to thinking all the time,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.160
until your thinking is tied to your reflexes.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.160
This game is a training program
to help you achieve that.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.050
The hardest monster in this
area is the Bubble Horse.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.060
If they clear that hurdle,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.390
they'll complete the second stage!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.960
Zetsu!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.810
Caught it!

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.330
I got a Bubble Horse!

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.210
Way to go.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.920
Yep!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.550
When it comes to analysis and
physical strength, Killua's stronger.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.580
But Gon makes up for it with his
concentration and recovery speed.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.090
They make a perfect team!

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.090
Okay, we'll now begin to
work on your defense.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.540
Is that...

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.930
That's right, Gon.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.100
This is the technique you've been using.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.100
Ten

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.460
<i>Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu</i>, and <i>Gyo</i>

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.980
Zetsu

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.900
Ren

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.730
Hatsu

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.530
Gyo

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.640
are combined in this technique.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.860
Ko!

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.120
Ko

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.460
You focus all of your aura into one
part of your body, then attack.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.120
This gives it far greater power
than your regular attacks.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.440
I'm going to attack with my fist.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.600
You must block my attacks.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.130
You may not dodge.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.390
You've figured it out?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.380
That's right...

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.500
If you use your aura to block normally,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.260
you'll take considerable damage.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.270
So what should you do?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.300
We should use <i>Ko</i>, too.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.640
You're half right.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.860
<i>Ko</i> against <i>Ko</i>.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.440
As long as you and your opponent
are similar in <i>Nen</i> capacity,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.020
you'll escape unscratched.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.400
However...

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.960
If your opponent hits you in a place
where you weren't using <i>Ko</i>,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.370
you'll be destroyed.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.300
Then we should use <i>Ko</i> on our entire body.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.920
Though it's contradictory.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.540
Exactly.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.940
This technique combines <i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.290
<i>Ken</i>.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.470
Ken

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.310
You defend yourself

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.920
by shrouding your body in
much more aura than usual.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.850
It isn't as strong as <i>Ko</i>,
but it's far more practical.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.930
Gon, use <i>Ren</i>.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.440
To sustain that for a prolonged
period is called <i>Ken</i>.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.080
Now protect yourself from my punch!

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.810
So slow.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.090
You must have relaxed when you
saw how slowly I was moving.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.530
If you'd stopped using <i>Ken</i>,
your face would have been smashed.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.310
That was the power of <i>Ko</i> alone.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.860
When I add the speed and power
packed by a normal punch,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.100
it becomes many times stronger.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.230
Even dozens of times stronger.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.990
I'll start by going slowly,
but you won't get any warning.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.620
Keep using <i>Ken</i>, and try to
withstand my attacks.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.520
Gon!

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.390
Hmm, that was almost two minutes...

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.890
<i>I had no idea it could be this
hard to keep up my </i>Nen.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.600
You need to be able to sustain
<i>Ken</i> for at least thirty minutes,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.530
or you won't stand a chance.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.330
Okay, we're through!

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.030
Learning to use <i>Ken</i>!

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.050
Good, that was thirty minutes!

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.050
Over the past month,
you've become a lot tougher.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.630
The number 3!

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.750
Bingo!

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.180
Killua was slightly faster.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.720
Gon, give me a thousand push-ups.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.350
Okay, we'll begin actual
combat training today.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.810
Ken!

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.420
In your current state, your attack
power is 50, defense 50.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.820
So if you fight each other while using <i>Ken</i>,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.690
you won't be able to deal much damage.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.830
What should you do?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.570
Use <i>Ko</i>!

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.970
You fool.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.910
What if he hits you where
you aren't using <i>Ko</i>?

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.160
Use <i>Gyo</i>?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.080
Correct!

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.180
From your current 50-50 state,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.560
at the moment of attack,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.160
you shift your fist to 70 POW,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.850
and the rest to 30 POW.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.550
You can use <i>Gyo</i> to alter your POW
depending on the situation.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.020
This is <i>Ryu</i>!

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.860
Ryu

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.580
Let's get started...

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.860
Right hand to 70 POW,
rest of your body to 30 POW!

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.180
It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.180
Left leg to 80 POW,
rest of your body to 20 POW!

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.130
Head to 60 POW,
rest of your body to 40 POW!

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.120
Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.530
Add it to your current training menu.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.390
Also...

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.640
We'll begin sparring now.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.270
Use <i>Ryu</i> the way I just taught you.
You can start out slow.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.370
When you're on the defensive,
determine your opponent's attack power

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.970
before defending with<i> Ryu</i>.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.280
With that said...

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280
Begin!

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.150
I'll go first, then.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.660
Right leg, 55 POW.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.660
Right leg, 60 POW, I think...

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.660
Left hand, 60 POW.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.120
Right fist, 80 POW!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.560
Left elbow, 80 POW!

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.180
If they keep this up daily, for two months,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.990
<i>they'll be able to fight at
full speed while using </i>Ryu.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.660
<i>After that, it'll be time for the final stage.</i>

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.910
Okay!

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.440
Time for a break!

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.890
Thank you very much!

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.670
Osu!

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.920
It's been two weeks.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.170
They've made a lot of progress...

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.920
It appears you're ready for the final stage.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.820
The final stage?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.680
Yes, you will begin training in
the individual categories.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.840
3!

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.930
Bingo!

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.430
A draw.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.430
You're free to train solely in your own category.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.690
In the case of an Enhancer...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.200
Enhancer

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.200
Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.790
You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.090
while training the nearby categories

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.840
of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.200
Then you'll master your own category faster.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.390
9!

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.450
Bingo!

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.950
A draw.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.090
Good job, Killua.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.950
Same to you.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.040
Then, let's get started.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.960
Osu!

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.960
Today, we'll be training in
the Enhancer category.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.840
Level 1 is smashing rocks.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.220
Crush them like this.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.720
Smash a thousand with a single stone
in a day, and you clear the level.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.590
And begin!

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.030
This is pretty tough.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.170
All I'm doing is

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.740
changing the stone to 100 POW
at the moment of impact.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.740
<i>But my</i> Nen <i>is weakening as I go.</i>

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.500
Oops, it crumbled...

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.720
If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.000
Damn!

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.630
Damn, I failed!

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.880
What are you talking about?
You did well.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.460
Okay!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.190
Let's do Transmuter training next.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.490
Now, now, don't rush.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.140
You're only allowed to train
one category per day.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.480
6!

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.390
Bingo! A draw.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.050
Again?

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.970
These days, we keep getting draws.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.650
That just shows that you've both
grown accustomed to using <i>Gyo</i>.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.670
But if there's no winner, it's no fun.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.160
Okay, then we'll decide
with rock-paper-scissors.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.240
The loser does a thousand push-ups!

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.700
Sure.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.480
First comes rock...

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.150
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.620
One more time!

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.590
I win!

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.650
Damn!

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:13.940
Hey, boys...

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.180
Have you heard the theory that
rock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:17.670
Huh?

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.620
Palm

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.020
Paper represents a palm attack that
wrecks the opponent's organs.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.640
Fingers

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.600
Scissors represents a finger jab,
targeting vital points.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.690
Fist

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.410
And rock represents a punch with
the fist to deal external damage.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:44.870
Evil Fist

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.470
Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.890
as purely destructive and banned as an evil art,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.880
martial artists trained by playing this game.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.570
And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.960
You really are old...

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.460
That's it!

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.080
Eh?

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.140
Evil Fist.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.020
Now, everyone.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.480
We have a total of 133 cards from
90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.660
This is the product of your hard work.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.730
You have our thanks.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.460
Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.930
They're as good as ours.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.080
However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.010
an equal number of restricted slot cards.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.790
The final hurdle will likely be a
showdown against their group.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.130
But I believe we have more,
and better, spell cards!

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.630
Gentlemen, our victory is near!

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.840
Can I say something?

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.020
These five years have been
so long, yet so short...

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.520
There's something I must tell you.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.030
I am the Bomber.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.050
What? The Bomber?

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.410
H-Hey, what are you talking about?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.910
Now, now... Hear me out.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.670
I've placed bombs on all of you.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.670
What was that?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.420
How did you do that?!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.050
Don't mess with us!

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.800
Stay calm and listen.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.470
Good grief.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.690
You ruined the explanation I'd planned.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.410
This is my power...

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.210
Little Flower.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.440
Fistful of Gunpowder
Little Flower

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.980
As you just saw,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.440
I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.950
But it isn't very strong.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.050
He's still alive.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.950
However,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.460
if the bombs on your bodies explode,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.090
you will die.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.210
A bomb? Where is it?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.470
I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.770
Let's start with how I set them.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.270
That was by touching the place on
the target I wanted to explode,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.350
and saying a certain keyword.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.480
The keyword is

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.730
"Bomber."

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.560
It was the Bomber again.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.230
Listen... Beware of the Bomber.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.230
In order to disarm the bombs,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.890
you must touch my body and say,
"I caught the Bomber."

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.760
However, I also have the Little Flower ability.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.890
I can use this to stop anyone
who tries to touch me.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.030
You must be very careful as you
attempt to disarm the bombs.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.410
That's all.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.670
They're armed.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.150
This is the ability Countdown.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.530
Sound of Life
Countdown

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.540
Why am I telling you so
much about my powers?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.040
That's the condition for arming the bombs.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.880
Then you've been waiting for
the day when all the cards

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.550
and members were gathered.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.290
Now, I have a proposition.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.550
I will trade your lives for those
90 restricted slot cards.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.520
If you agree, I will use an alternative method,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.940
and simultaneously disarm all the bombs.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:46.390
Do nothing, and all of you will die
when the counter reaches zero.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.700
You should discuss this amongst yourselves.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.520
I'll be waiting for you at
Mr. Battera's old mansion.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.570
I don't care who comes, but come alone.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.710
Are you insane?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.660
If we just catch you now and
disarm the bombs, it's all over.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.160
Do you think you can escape alone?!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.410
Calm yourselves...

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.530
If you get too excited,
the countdown will accelerate.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.710
Because the counter is linked
to your heartbeat.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.350
What?

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.430
Book!

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.880
Crap!

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.610
I pray we meet again!

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.110
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.110
Leave on!

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.030
He escaped outside the game!

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.870
We have to follow him...

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.060
Wait!

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.180
If we leave, the cards inside
our binders will vanish!

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.500
Then what do we do?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.280
Calm down!

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.500
It would be unwise to chase him down!

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.230
Have you forgotten why we teamed up?

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.510
Because we aren't strong fighters!

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.900
Does anyone here think they're
strong enough to defeat him?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.600
It would be impossible.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.020
Given his <i>Nen</i> abilities, he must be powerful.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.660
If all of us attacked him together,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.020
he could use Little Flower to defeat us all.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.280
Damn, we were so close!

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.230
First, we must reach a consensus.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.800
Do we hand over the cards?

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.610
Or do we fight?

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.410
Please give him the cards...

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.620
I beg you.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.000
Jispa's running out of time...

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.430
That's a surprise.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.870
I was expecting Nickes to come.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.340
I'm surprised, too.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.060
I didn't expect you to be alone...

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.260
Sub and Bara.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.310
They're the other bombers.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.320
Now give me your ring.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.180
What's wrong?

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.870
I can't turn it over yet...

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.430
Actually, we still haven't reached a decision.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:05.630
And Nickes has requested the Breath
of Archangel card to save Jispa.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.800
Screw that!

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.820
As it stands, neither side can win this!

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.590
Eh?

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.320
You don't realize how hysterical they are.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.000
If they can't make a decision before
time expires and they explode,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.970
you'll lose the data in their rings!

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.550
But I can—

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.470
But you can convince them?

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.140
Are you trying to bargain with me?

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.240
When striking a bargain,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.490
you have to demonstrate just
how calm and insane you are.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.140
W-Wait...

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.990
If you kill me...

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.580
Don't worry.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.140
If you kill a player outside the
game and take their ring,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.130
the restricted slot data will not vanish.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.130
Well, I doubt you have any of the cards.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.680
A gift.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.670
Puhat!

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.400
You won't get another chance.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.490
Okay?

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:16.780
Leave...

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.310
The spell card! Leave!

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.490
I need to exit, so give it to me.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.160
Hell, no!

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.110
Leave is a valuable card.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.500
We can't waste any!

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.990
Okay, then...

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.650
If I don't return,

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.810
it won't be possible to disarm all
your bombs simultaneously.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.510
What?

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.760
I'm also a bomber.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.540
There are three of us.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.690
Well, Genthru's the main one,

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.770
and we're just extras.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.460
When the three of us join our
right thumbs and say the keyword,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.160
the bombs will be destroyed.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.280
That's the alternative method.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.560
Whatever...

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.490
I'll take my time returning
via normal means.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.570
You guys will be dead soon.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.280
Wait! Hold on!

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.880
Please use this.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.540
You should have done that
in the first place, scum!

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.990
We'll need Leave cards
when the deal is made.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.420
Have three ready.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.050
Got it?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.290
Twelve hours before Genthru
revealed himself as the Bomber,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.030
a single boat attempted to
invade from the outside.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.490
So it does exist in the real world.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.330
That's gotta be Greed Island.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:03.470
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.360
Today, we introduce the card Leave.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:15.040
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.960
This takes us back to the real world?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.080
That's nice.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.050
If you're going out, leave the free slot cards.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.640
Stupid onliner!

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.690
Huh?

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.260
Next time: Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.300
See ya here next week!

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.280
Rock, paper, scissors!
