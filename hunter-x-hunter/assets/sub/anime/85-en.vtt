WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Neferpitou.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
Huh?

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.980
That is the name the Queen gave me.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.650
From now on, call me Neferpitou.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.990
Light x And x Darkness

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.700
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.580
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.910
Commander Neferpitou will hold

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.510
an award ceremony in auditorium one.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.450
If you are able to endure considerable pain,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.260
you will receive tremendous power in return.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.620
That power is to be used for our Queen!

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.780
They're continuing to go straight.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.790
The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.930
Amazing...

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.870
He's been picking them up this entire time,
never losing them for an instant.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.920
Kite said he could use <i>En</i> within
a radius of forty-five meters.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.950
I've heard that those called <i>Nen</i> masters
can handle around fifty meters.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.730
Kite is nearly there.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.300
Actually, given that he's kept
it up for an entire night,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.670
he's probably stronger.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.190
Stronger than a master...

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.230
Then Kite's the real deal.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.700
Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.950
Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.110
but we really only knew him
as another player in a game.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.460
Bisky was an incredible Hunter.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.420
But to us...

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.920
Yeah, she was our <i>Nen</i> mentor.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.220
And the first to teach us about <i>Nen</i>...

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.100
Wing-san was our <i>Nen</i> master and savior.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.910
Looking back,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.240
we always meet the right people
just when we need them most.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.740
And those people have all made us stronger.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.220
Razor, too, huh?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.990
Yeah.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.370
It's clear that Ging really did create
<i>Greed Island </i>to train you.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.630
And once you beat the game,
he deliberately led you to Kite.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.250
Ging!

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm not sure if Ging predicted what
would happen when we met Kite.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.900
But he certainly knew

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.830
that you would like the man who
had earned Ging's respect.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.220
And he knew without doubt
that you would go with Kite.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.920
He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.420
This is a pretty brutal place for training, though.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.550
That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.560
As you mentioned,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.060
Ging-san probably had certain
expectations when he sent you to me.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.510
But I do not intend to train
you during this journey.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.940
We don't have that kind of time.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.320
I brought you along because I
thought you might be of use.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.940
From here, it all comes down to your resolve.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.990
If it's strong, you'll develop your <i>Nen</i>
and grow strong via combat.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.170
If it's weak, the Ants will eat you.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.150
But we can't die...

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.680
We are pro Hunters.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.430
Those who call themselves
Hunters always get their prey.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.920
For Hunters, that is the first commandment.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.320
Those who call themselves Hunters
should always be on the hunt.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.570
A hunt involves both hunter and prey.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.080
It is a battle of resolve.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.780
Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve
is what makes a successful hunt.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.040
The loser has to follow the
winner's rules and customs.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.340
Usually, this means the loser's death.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.340
Rules...

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.410
If you don't want that result, then win.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.740
Improving your <i>Nen</i> is important, of course.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.030
But to be a successful Hunter, you must
understand your enemy and yourself.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.780
Th-That's why...

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.150
That's why you hit me back then!

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.320
Fool!

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.030
Why would you try to enter Snake
Beech Forest in this season?!

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.340
Look!

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.930
That's a territorial marker
made by Foxbears with cubs.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.090
Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.970
That was the forest's rule and custom.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.810
You taught me the rules in Ging's place.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.360
Oh...

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.470
That's right... I just remembered.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.830
A Hunter License?

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.120
What's this?

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.870
This is Ging-san's.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.120
Huh? It's Ging's?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.250
Do you remember what my final test was?

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.380
Yeah, to find Ging.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.490
Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.060
He said I should use it to find him...

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.110
I planned to return it to him once I did.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.900
Huh? He wouldn't take it back?

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.190
No...

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.040
I completely forgot I had it.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.280
Gon, you said that you're going to
find Ging-san on your own, right?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.190
Huh?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.040
Yeah.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.630
Then you have to do it.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.510
And would you return this for me?

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.440
Sure!

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.550
But first, I have to finish this job
with you and get a lot stronger.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.060
After that, I'll find Ging and give this back.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.140
I promise!

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.040
I'm counting on you.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.560
Well,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.400
let's get a move on before we lose the trail.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.460
Take that!

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.830
Next!

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.490
Being average is terrible...

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.370
You have to go to all this trouble
just to unleash your power.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.830
Peggy, I'll leave this to you.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.970
Where are you going?

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.500
I want to find out how strong I really am.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.700
That's a monster.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.100
What is this?

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.500
I don't believe it!

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.260
What's wrong, Kite?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.430
Gon, Killua...

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.330
Run!

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.990
Huh?

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.700
Hurry up!

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.030
Get out of here!

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760
Found you...

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.220
Get away from me!

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.180
Malice

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.470
Idio—

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.890
Good decision, Killua.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.400
Take Gon and run!

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.920
This time, you're in big trouble...

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.030
Let's see if you get a good roll!

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.910
3!

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.920
Ah, so you can do stuff like that?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.530
We were overconfident...

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.010
The two of us were still weaker
than Kite who'd lost an arm.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.890
That thing knew.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.100
This is reality.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.970
If Kite had been alone,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.680
this probably wouldn't have happened.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.730
We were fools!

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.290
Hey...

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.220
Look.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.340
Huh? You left Kite behind?

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.760
Why?!

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.540
What happened?

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.270
Explain what's going on!

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.020
H-Hey, what are you doing?!

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.480
Yes, I understand.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.520
Can you wait there a little longer?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.030
We're headed your way right now.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.230
We have reinforcements.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.260
Chairman Netero.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.500
What's this? They're just kids.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.350
If you're here to play, you'll get burned.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.590
Go back home.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.590
Stop it, Morel-san.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.470
That isn't nice...

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.720
They're only children.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.510
You look pretty defeated.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.240
Was the enemy that strong?

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.410
One of them could use <i>Nen</i>.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.470
That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.350
Worse than my brother's...

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.000
Worse than Hisoka's...

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.860
Now that I've learned <i>Nen</i> myself, I can tell.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.740
You guys are unbelievably strong.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.010
But I still can't see you defeating that thing...

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.010
Whenever humans encounter the unknown,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.490
they tend to lose perspective.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.920
Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.430
We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.430
You're no better than I am, Knov.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.090
Kid...

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:06.460
The minute you start talking about who
can win in a <i>Nen</i> fight, you're wrong.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.690
In most cases, you won't know
your opponent's abilities.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.070
One instant of carelessness

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.090
is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:26.000
You can't make assumptions based
on the amount of aura displayed.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.970
The battle can turn at any point.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.470
That's what fighting with <i>Nen</i> means.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.680
But regardless,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.150
you must always fight certain of victory.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.170
That is a <i>Nen</i> user's spirit.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.570
The moment you were overwhelmed

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.790
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.890
You're lower than a loser!

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.990
Morel, that's enough.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.000
Is Gon asleep?

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.810
He was going to attack the enemy,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.500
so I used force to stop him.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.850
I didn't have time to control my strength,

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.010
so I don't know when he'll wake up.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.500
That kid shows some promise, then.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.760
Morel!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.450
It's difficult to believe that giant
Chimera Ants are eating humans,

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.310
but since it appears to be true,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.900
we must keep casualties to a minimum.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.270
If we send fighters who aren't strong enough,
they'll only strengthen the enemy.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.410
Do you understand?

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.150
Yeah.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.900
That's why there are only three.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.280
A select few...

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.510
We're not

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.200
strong enough.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.030
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.440
It's your decision whether you want to fight.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.350
But you must defeat them before you come.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.790
If you wish to live as a Hunter...

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.710
We are not desperate for help.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.560
We only seek the strong.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.480
Will you fight!? Or not!?

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.170
The moment you were overwhelmed

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.510
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.100
You're lower than a loser!

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.580
I am no longer qualified...

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.590
Killua...

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.470
Thanks.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.520
Why would you thank me?

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.060
Weren't you the one who stopped me?

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.040
Had I lost control back there,
I would've gotten in Kite's way.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.050
Then, all three of us could have died.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.550
But I...

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.550
I let Kite die...

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.180
Kite is alive!

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.560
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:14.470
But considering his injury,
he'd have a hard time moving around.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.580
So he's probably hiding.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.570
Waiting for us to return!

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.820
So we should hurry back...

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.020
Once we're stronger.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.000
To save Kite!

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.350
Gon...

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.290
You are light.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.780
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.160
Sometimes, you shine so
brightly, I must look away.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.860
But even so, is it still okay
if I stay at your side?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.310
Let's go.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.110
To become stronger!

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.220
We welcome you anytime!!

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.980
Prepare a freezer in the castle.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.800
We need one that can store
over a hundred humans.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.830
To ensure that our collection doesn't rot.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:47.890
Yep.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.730
I think

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.730
I'm pretty strong.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.260
Next time: Promise x and x Reunion.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.590
It has to be Killua...

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.220
Stay asleep in the <i>chair, man</i>.
