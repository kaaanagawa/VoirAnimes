WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Yeah, this looks real.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.850
There's a video attached.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.110
We have two targets.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.110
A man and a woman.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.660
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.610
Got it.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.680
Let's go, Killua.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.240
Yeah.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.040
Pursuit x And x Analysis

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.230
After a tip about the Phantom Troupe,
Gon and his friends move out.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.290
There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.250
However, the two aren't just
waiting around to be caught.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.920
Was Uvo really killed?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.810
Probably.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.920
Uvo was more than just a dumb brute.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.070
I know that.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.260
Even if he were fighting
a difficult opponent,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.200
he had the wits and experience to prevail.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.530
Hello?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.700
I'm the one who submitted the request.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.150
You're late! Where are you?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.720
Stop looking around...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.850
I can see you.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.990
It's the couple behind your boyfriend?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.820
I'll wire the money to you now,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.090
so please confirm receipt.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.840
For real?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.760
Let's go!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.600
Hurry!

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.850
But Uvo didn't return.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.480
Has he ever been late without informing us?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.610
But remember what he said?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.110
He wasn't coming back until he
settled up with that chain user.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.890
That's why I said probably.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.620
I never said he was definitely dead.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.030
Just a hunch?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.850
Just a hunch.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.710
Well, you're usually right.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.500
Okay, we should decide our next move.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.030
How do we catch those two?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.540
It's impossible.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.640
We aren't strong enough to handle them.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.930
What was that?

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.670
We won't know until we try!

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.330
And why are you saying this now?!

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.100
Quiet... They'll notice us.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.610
But it's still true.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.400
I knew it as soon as I saw them.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.490
My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.550
Huh?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.310
What?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.780
One of the few times I've
ever heard him complain.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.930
Said the job wasn't worth the price.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.540
That's considered the greatest
compliment a target can get.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.920
That was when he told us

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.810
to stay away from the Troupe.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.880
It's been a few years,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.250
so I thought we might stand a chance...

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.570
They're really that strong?

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.690
Would it help you to picture
two Hisokas sitting there?

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.740
That is definitely not

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.190
something we can handle.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.320
So, why do you think they're here?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.970
Aren't they on a date?

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.420
Huh? Really?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.200
No, they noticed that other
couple behind them.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.710
They're paying close attention
to their surroundings.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.340
At first, I thought it was just caution
because the Mafia is after them.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.090
But in that case, they wouldn't
be sitting in a public place.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.850
They aren't worried at all.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.730
They're waiting for someone to find them.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.730
Acting as bait, to draw out their prey.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.730
We're being watched.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.630
They aren't amateurs.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.210
Yeah, I can't tell where they are,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.090
but they're focused on us.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.370
Is it the chain user?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.280
No idea.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.410
If it is, we'll follow the
boss' orders to go wild.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.330
I believe the boss wishes to recruit him.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.000
Machi...

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.260
The boss only told us to find
him and bring him back.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.890
Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.700
Alive or dead.
By any means necessary.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.270
Right?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.840
You're free to interpret the
boss' orders as you like,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.370
but you can't force me to agree.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.240
I haven't said anything yet.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.910
You're the one forcing the issue.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.050
The atmosphere changed.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.990
I've got a really bad feeling...

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.700
Did they notice us?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.720
It's okay.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.130
They haven't noticed us yet.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.630
Are you sure?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.050
Besides, I can't use <i>Zetsu</i> like
you guys to mask my presence.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.800
If we used <i>Zetsu</i>, that would
attract their attention.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.190
They aren't trying to sense <i>Nen</i>.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.220
They're trying to see if there's anyone

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.710
in this area who looks or acts suspicious.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.350
So you'd better wipe those
looks off your faces.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.190
Act normal.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.450
Sorry, that was a bad idea.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.570
Let's make it clear, then.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.100
Are we going to take him dead, or alive?

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.730
Fine.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.220
Heads.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.220
Tails.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.640
Her?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.110
Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.230
Her name is Neon.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.830
According to the online Hunter information,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.230
the chain user is one of her bodyguards.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.200
As for her other bodyguards,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.840
we have pictures and names for these five.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.550
And this girl is responsible
for Nostrade's success?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.640
Most likely.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.530
This information comes
from the Hunter website,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.770
so it should be accurate.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.000
I see...

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.750
Now I understand what happened.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.010
It was wise to switch rooms.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.930
The Phantom Troupe is definitely
using the pro Hunter website.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.960
If you'd moved any later,
Neon might have been in danger.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960
I'm grateful.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.690
Looking ahead, the first step

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.760
is to get my daughter home.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.170
Is that okay, Neon?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.280
Well, I don't have a choice.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.320
The auction was canceled,
so I don't have any reason to stay.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.290
I really wanted to go...

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.830
They'll hold another auction next year.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.320
Cheer up.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.270
And I promise I'll recover

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.260
the items you wanted from those bandits.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.860
Really?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.860
Yes, I promise.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.310
Have I ever broken a promise?

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.920
Have you ever kept a promise?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.840
You make a good point...

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.690
I believe your names are
Melody and Basho?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.050
Yes...

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.190
You'll take Neon back to
the house immediately.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.090
To be on the safe side,
use simple disguises.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.990
Okay, Neon.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.120
Return to your room and pack.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.550
Okay.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.660
All right, let's get down to our real business.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.880
The auction will resume tonight.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.580
The time and location haven't changed.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.640
The community must demonstrate

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.890
that they will not allow anyone
to intimidate them.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.520
The Ten Dons have vowed to
recover the stolen merchandise.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.020
The stolen merchandise?

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.350
As I told you earlier,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.820
the man we captured claimed

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.940
that a Shadow Beast had taken
everything before they arrived.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.340
Yes, that's correct.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.040
The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.270
Nine bodies have been recovered so far.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.480
The final member, Owl, was the one

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.170
carrying the merchandise.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.090
He was probably captured by the Troupe.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.290
The Ten Dons understand how
frightening <i>Nen</i> can be.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.140
If the Troupe has someone who can
use <i>Nen</i> to compel confession,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.680
they wouldn't even need torture.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.630
It's believed that the merchandise Owl took

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.770
has fallen into the Troupe's hands.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.460
So, as I was saying,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.270
with the Shadow Beasts
destroyed, the Ten Dons

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.570
are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.820
Professionals?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.130
To the Mafia,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.250
murder is a tool, not our trade.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.970
Considering our opponents,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.260
it would be better to leave it to the experts.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.220
We'll have them

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.630
crush the Troupe for us,
while avoiding further losses.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.430
However, it's also a chance to make a
name for ourselves in the community.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.370
We cannot allow those hit men all the glory.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.980
So, Kurapika...

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.110
I want you to join those hit men.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.740
Take care of the chain user for me.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.220
Got it.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.190
They're on the move.
What should we do?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.380
As I told you, we can't
beat them in a fight.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.890
We'll find a way...

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.140
We have to.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.190
Yeah.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.510
We can't leave empty-handed.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.770
Okay.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.550
Then listen carefully.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.910
Gon and I will tail them.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.030
We absolutely cannot let them spot us.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.280
We'll use <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.160
Wow...

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.280
I can see him standing here,
but I can't sense him.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.410
Gon, I need you to make me two promises.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.670
If they see us, we give up
immediately and escape.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.050
If I judge that further pursuit is impossible
for any other reason, we give up.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.970
Got it?

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.360
Uh-huh.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.220
The signal to stop will be one phone call.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.600
Make sure your phone's on vibrate.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.460
If they split up, we follow the woman.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.720
Leorio,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.170
contact Zepile, and keep an
eye on the auction for us.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.530
Got it.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.980
I'm guessing you've never
tailed anyone before?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.150
Um...

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.480
Well...

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.770
During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.530
Really? Without his noticing?

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.240
Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.080
Wow, not bad.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.800
Ow... Why did you hit me?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.360
Uh, it seemed appropriate.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.950
Well, then you should have no problem.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.920
Be sure to stay out of
their field of vision.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.560
Okay, let's go.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.310
Yeah!

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.070
The targets have passed the plaza
and entered a side street.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.100
Okay, confirmed.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.650
Do they know we're here?

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.450
It's okay.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.360
We're using <i>Zetsu</i>, so they shouldn't notice
us unless something's really wrong.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.420
But they're on constant guard
against pursuers, so stay vigilant.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.420
Yeah.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.860
You, too.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.100
Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.150
I'm the one who has to be alert to
any change in their movements.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.710
It's okay.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.840
They haven't noticed us.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.130
When they realize we're here,
they'll react in some way.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.340
They can try to conceal it,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.530
but their faces or behavior will betray it.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.150
I've been put through life-or-death
shadowing exercises since I was three.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.980
I won't fail and lose sight of them!

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.150
Are we being followed?

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.990
Most likely, I'd guess.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.480
I'm impressed.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.490
I can't sense a thing.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.250
They must be quite skilled.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.060
Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.020
They must realize by now that
they're being followed.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.530
Then is this a trap?

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.480
No, they don't know our exact locations.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.210
Or maybe they don't know they're being
followed and are heading back to base.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.000
That would make this a huge success.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.650
Is this a trap?

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.040
Or their hideout?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.790
Which is it?

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.750
If it's a trap, we should run immediately.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.440
If it's their hideout, we should continue.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.050
They're acting calm...

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.050
We continue!

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.230
Our stalker isn't taking the bait.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.560
It probably isn't the chain user.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.640
Why not?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.740
I can sense multiple people tailing us.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.580
But the chain user works alone.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.570
How can you be sure?

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.300
He's a member of the
Nostrade Family, right?

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.030
Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.330
I'm sure because the Mafia
hasn't taken any action.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.770
If the Mafia were responsible,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.290
they would use Uvo as a chip
against us, dead or alive.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.850
Had they killed him, the news would
probably be on the Net by now.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.110
Since there's nothing,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.530
the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.080
without reporting it to the Mafia.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.860
Why would someone who works
for the Mafia operate solo?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.470
It was probably a personal grudge.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.250
You're using "probably" a lot.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.340
Shut up.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.310
I doubt that someone seeking
revenge without Mafia backup

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.870
would team up with anyone else.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.090
Thus, the chain user is operating alone

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.970
and unrelated to the group now pursuing us.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.830
Your theory has a lot of holes.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.260
Then what do you think?

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.340
Indeed...

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.740
I suspect that there's a link between
this tail and the chain user.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.390
You just know?

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620
I just know.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.770
Man...

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.150
People who act on instinct
shouldn't criticize theories.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.000
Well, Killua?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.780
They're waiting for someone
or trying to lure us out.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.040
One or the other.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.410
Do they know we're following them?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.220
Right now, it's fifty-fifty.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.050
But they don't know our location.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.170
They want to draw us out because
they don't know where we are.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.670
They're inviting us to show ourselves.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.570
What do we do?

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.880
They may be waiting for someone else.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.250
Hold your position and wait.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.180
Gon, I'm hanging up.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.100
Pay close attention.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.180
If they give any kind of reaction,
we'll run for it!

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.170
Escape as soon as I ring the phone.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.030
Got it?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.940
Yeah, got it.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.710
Phinks here.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.450
Oh, what's up?

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.240
I wanted to see how you were doing.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.910
We're being followed,
but they haven't made a move.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.940
And we can't locate them,
so this will take a while.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.620
Oh, then would you like some helpful info?

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.460
Hmm? What do you mean?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.750
The stones were a distraction?

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.500
This'll get him!

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.780
He stopped me with ease...

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.260
With one hand!

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.210
Yo.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.980
Phinks, why are you here?

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.490
Weren't you heading out with the boss?

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.490
This is the fourth floor.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.240
To fool the enemy,
you first fool your allies.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.840
The boss got me good again.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.000
I wondered why there were so
many <i>Zetsu</i> masters around.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.890
Stalking the stalkers?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.270
Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.250
They fooled us!

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.220
Okay, kid.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.030
I have a few questions for you.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.020
Boy, do you know the chain user?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.790
Huh?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.500
A <i>Nen</i> user who uses chains to fight.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.190
We're looking for him.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.690
He asked you to follow us, right?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.440
I don't know who that is.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.160
We were following you
for our own reasons.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.270
I just need one moment...

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.410
With an opening, I can escape!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.410
Well?

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.270
Well, indeed...

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.420
If he's lying, he's really good.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.830
I can check.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.750
Question 1...
Why were you following us?

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.550
Answer concisely.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.650
Lying will only make the situation worse.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.440
The Mafia has put a huge
bounty on your heads.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.450
Websites are offering a lot of money
just for information on your location.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.190
Question 2...
Who taught you to shadow people?

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.360
Well, mainly,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.060
I was using <i>Zetsu</i>, a <i>Nen</i> ability,
to conceal my presence.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.120
I'm trying to become a pro Hunter.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.000
Who taught you how to do that?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.870
A Shingen-ryu master.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.250
Question 3...

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.500
Do you know a <i>Nen</i> user
who fights with chains?

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.340
Chains?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.050
He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.960
Does your master have chains
hanging from his right arm?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.770
Or perhaps it's you?

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.290
I don't know.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.550
My master is an Enhancer,

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.280
and he only taught me the
four major principles.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.380
I see... Well, nothing we
can do, if you don't know.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.740
Time for the last question, then.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.550
You have two choices.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.540
Consider carefully before you answer.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.210
Do you want to die now or later?

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.290
Make your choice.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.540
You have three seconds to answer.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.800
It's useless.
Don't try anything foolish.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.050
Yes...

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.820
Understood, we'll head over.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.170
Boy, your friend surrendered.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.190
I'll ask you once more.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.820
Do you know the chain user?

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.810
My answer is the same.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.750
I don't.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.690
I see.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.300
How about you?

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.830
Any guesses?

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.350
Welcome to our base.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.860
They stand inside the
Phantom Troupe's hideout...

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.590
...nerves mounting to their limits.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:16.000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.170
Today, we introduce Machi.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.700
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.270
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.620
She's a Transmuter.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:16.000
Transmutes aura into <i>Nen</i>
threads that she controls.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.760
She can turn her aura into <i>Nen</i> threads.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.460
Her special technique is Nen Stitches.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.310
She can put your body back together!

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.210
Like this!

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840
Next time: Ally x And x Sword.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.630
Snatch!

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.140
Bam!

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.970
Look! I caught it!

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.970
That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.480
Ka-boom!
