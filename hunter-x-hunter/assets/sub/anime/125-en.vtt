WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Killua...

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.510
I have you to thank.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.970
I've been like this since I woke up.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.590
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.880
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.420
But you must not forget...

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.850
You are the one Gon needs most.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.020
Great Power x And x Ultimate Power

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.400
Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.870
miraculously returned Palm to her old self.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.990
Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.270
Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.190
appearing before those in the room

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.410
in order to challenge Pouf.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.860
Pouf...

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.770
Step outside.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.380
Very well.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.500
I will face you.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.290
But first, I have something to say.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.540
That which stands before you is only a clone.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.050
My true body is already on its way to the King.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.890
Having escaped the cage of smoke,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.560
Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle
and Morel had made contact.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.740
He decided to assume

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.990
that his enemies knew of
his ability to create clones,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.660
and to act accordingly.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.590
That was the correct call.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.780
The boss told me that you could make clones.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.660
You're telling the truth.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.250
Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.180
By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted
to gain the mental advantage.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.920
His plan was a success.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.290
But why are you telling me this?

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.470
Pouf's concern was Youpi.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.690
Since Knuckle was here,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.390
that meant that Youpi had spared his life

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.770
and had not told Pouf this.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.830
Depending on his reason...

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.260
Answer me!

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.050
To satisfy him.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.310
Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully
so that he could persuade Knuckle

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.160
to tell him the motive behind the
transformation he'd sensed in Youpi.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.070
I told you in order to satisfy him.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.340
He has demanded that I not leave this room.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.050
If we are to engage in a duel,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.530
I will need him to withdraw his
demand, so that I may leave.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.720
I am but a clone...

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.200
I cannot use my wing scales.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.760
However, I am still willing to fight you.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.270
What I seek is a discussion.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.840
That is why I revealed the truth.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.360
Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who
would call him from behind to challenge him,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.220
appearing to be telling the truth
would be more effective.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.870
You're lying...

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.380
You were going to kill me from behind.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.310
You even admitted it.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.390
Knuckle, don't let him fool you!

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.950
First, you claim to be a clone.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.900
Are you able to prove that?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.900
He's right.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.910
This boy is proving troublesome.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.040
I dare say that, of our enemies,
he possesses the strongest will.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.770
Perhaps I should be pleased

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.930
that he is trapped here with Pitou.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.420
Because his strong will keeps him in here.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.070
Were I to prove myself a clone, I would
be placing myself at a disadvantage.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.740
So I can say nothing.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.080
You must use your own judgment.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.680
And...

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.280
I shall allow you

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.960
to decide what happens next.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.720
Pouf, you can't mean to...

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.980
Stop...

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.510
I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.150
Whether you come or not is your choice!

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.270
Please wait...

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.290
I'm still here!

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.390
I apologize for Pouf's behavior!

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.610
I'm the only one you need, right?

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.780
Ten minutes.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.290
You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.300
Pitou was trembling.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.970
It was disturbing enough that

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.470
Pouf had been willing to leave,
despite the consequences.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.230
But what was truly frightening was
how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.680
calmly moving up the deadline instead.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.840
How long?

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.820
How long do I have to wait?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.830
To completely heal her

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.580
will take three to four hours.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.830
No, I can't wait that long.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.840
If I have an hour,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.090
I can heal her most critical injuries.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.130
Originally, to protect Komugi
and heal her completely,

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.840
Pitou had deliberately named a longer
time frame than was necessary,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.860
which Gon had denied.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.400
So the hour that they'd agreed
upon was the actual time

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.370
Pitou believed necessary for Komugi
to make a full recovery.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.900
However,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.960
Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.260
It may have been possible

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.990
to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.770
Upon thinking this, Pitou realized...

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.750
It may have been mere coincidence,

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.500
but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten
minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.490
Despite that likelihood, Pitou
could not shake a bad feeling.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.310
I must risk my life.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.660
Or else his fangs

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.160
may reach the King's throat!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.790
I understand.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.470
Knuckle.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.360
I'll be fine here alone.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.050
I said that Pouf was lying,

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.610
but it's probably true that his main
body is headed for the King.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.060
The King is to the south.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.570
Gon and Killua had seen everything
that had transpired.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.880
But since Pitou did not know that,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.870
it was only natural to assume that Gon

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.580
had seen through Pouf's plans.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.780
Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.300
Pitou was now fully resolved to
complete the mission at hand.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.290
I must kill him.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.110
No matter the cost!

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.890
I must kill him...

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.670
For the King's sake!

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.860
Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.460
No, that won't work.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.750
I can't expose her to danger.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.060
First, I must entrust her to someone else.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.430
Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.110
This won't do.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.130
If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.400
Gon,

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.550
I understand what you're saying.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.290
However...

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.110
I will still do things my way.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.620
Youpi is...

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.960
No, never mind.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.970
If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.880
it could result in his death.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.340
See ya.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.830
Knuckle managed to stop himself.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.450
How would you know my name?

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.050
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.330
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.540
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.680
Interested in fighting me now?

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.850
If you can force me to admit defeat,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.290
I will tell you your name.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.480
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.910
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.070
No matter.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.280
I shall checkmate you shortly.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.920
As the King moved into his stance,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.030
Netero took to the air.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.960
When was it...

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.480
that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.000
Whenever you're ready,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.220
come at me.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.270
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.770
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.960
Ninety-ninth Hand

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.160
Ninety-ninth Hand!

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.440
When was it

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.020
that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.510
taking the hands of vanquished opponents

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.300
when they bowed their heads in defeat?

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.970
That cannot be

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.590
the ultimate power I sought!

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.670
It is fighting with all my soul against

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.980
an opponent with the strength to defeat me!

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.010
This is a tomb.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.380
Your tomb.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.610
I am very thankful.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.460
Thankful for everything

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.760
that has made our meeting possible!

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.920
Next time: Zero x And x Rose.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.120
We haven't seen each other in a while.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.800
Yeah.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.830
But it feels like you were always with me.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.800
Yeah.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.630
The future is ours.
