00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
<i>Chain Jail.</i>

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.130
<i>This power can only be used on the spiders...</i>

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.880
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.960
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.250
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.560
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.220
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.020
The proof of my resolve.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.020
Restraint x And x Vow

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.480
After using Chain Jail

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.590
to capture Uvogin, Kurapika

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.030
and his fellow bodyguards flee by car.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.930
We have cars behind us.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.290
Someone check it out.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.340
Indeed...

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.540
Think it's them?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.370
Kurapika, floor it!

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.050
It's a tail!

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.330
A tail?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.310
But who?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.800
Could it be?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.630
A thread!

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.080
Probably made of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.940
There's something on his left thigh.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.190
Damn!

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.260
They noticed it.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.440
That was faster than expected.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.050
Don't worry.
We've almost got them!

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.320
Whatever...

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.040
Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.830
It's just a little longer.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.750 line:20%
Fun Fun Cloth:
Convenient Magic Kerchief

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.520
What the hell?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.390
Hey!

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.070
Let me out, damn it!

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.200
You guys really are good.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.860
Given that you were

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.550
fast enough to open the door
and escape in moments.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.790
I'll need to take care.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.170
Nobunaga had an unlucky position...

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.300
Anyway, you have an interesting ability.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.300
Let me out, damn it!

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.730
You can shrink anything merely
by using that cloth?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.060
That would be quite handy for theft.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.060
With that thing, you could fit all
of the treasure in your pocket.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.370
Meaning that he's the one
who took the treasure

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.060
from the auction house.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.520
And so, you can also restore
everything to its original size.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.570
I believe the boss said he's named Owl.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.830
His friends have arrived to help.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.990
Yes...

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.220
There are quite a few of them.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.730
Who are these guys?

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.730
Are they really Phantom Troupe members?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.980
Yeah, definitely.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.240
But they look so weak.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.170
One, two, three...

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.390
Huh?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.160
What's wrong?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.700
There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.000
Uvo took care of four,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.030
so this should be the rest.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.470
That is strange.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.500
The chain user grabbed Uvo,
before escaping by car.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.440
Does that mean the chain
user isn't a Shadow Beast?

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.660
Well, we'll know once we ask them...

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.230
Should we keep them all alive?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.020
No, we require only Owl.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.520
Then I'll handle that.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.380
Those damned kids are talking smack.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.030
Let's show them how scary the
Shadow Beasts can be.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.870
Did you hear that?

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.160
Shalnark, you just stand
there and watch.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.720
I'll take three.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.160
Shizuku can have the other two.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.410
Got it.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.160
Don't get cocky!

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.400
Keep your cool!

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.160
Don't underestimate their strength!

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.170
Shut up!

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.010
We lost them.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.410
But what was it that I just saw

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.430
landing on the roof of their car?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.050
Probably one of the
remaining Shadow Beasts.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.060
This is our chance to
hurry back to the city.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.360
Roger that.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.010
We'll switch the location to pattern C.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.630
And we don't want Muscles
here putting up a fight,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.820
so we'll need muscle relaxants
and sleeping gas.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.640
I hope those will work...

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.080
Move, and you'll get cut.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.020
Okay, all done.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.090
What about the bodies?

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.860
Just leave them.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.840
No point hiding them now.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.190
Okay, let's free Nobunaga

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.970
before we start torturing this guy.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.350
Hold on.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.740
We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.640
There's no room, so let's
leave Nobunaga as he is.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.860
Screw that! Let me out!

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.360
I don't want to be cramped, either.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.610
Come on!

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.190
Hey, can you release the car alone?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.660
I know you can hear me!

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.100
You're really making me mad!

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.700
Th-That's impossible...

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.300
Let me out, already!

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.110
Too bad.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.900
So much for that...

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.750
Hey! What's going on?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.380
You bastards were

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.810
making a fool out of me!

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.900
Troupe members aren't
supposed to snap at one other.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.880
Shut up!

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.560
Anyway, this ability could come
in handy for our job.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.670
Shut your mouth!

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.760
I'm cutting this guy to shreds!

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.870
No.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.610
He's going to tell us
where the treasure is...

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.110
Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.860
You just have bad luck.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.620
Damn it!

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.520
Hey, wake up!

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.400
You understand

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.760
what's happening here?

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.650
Where did you put the
stolen merchandise?

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.410
What time is it?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.910
How long have I been asleep?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.790
It seems that you don't grasp
your current situation.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.050
I'm asking the questions here!

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.290
Incredible mental fortitude...

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.120
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.980
but the aura around his
body remains firm.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.330
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.080
That is why his aura is so strong.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.210
The product of countless battles.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.880
I'm asking the questions here!

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.000
Incredible mental fortitude...

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.880
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.640
but the aura around his
body remains firm.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.160
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.910
That is why his aura is so strong.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.000
The product of countless battles.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.270
Can I move?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.670
No...

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.520
I won't recover for a while.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.280
I had dinner around 8.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.320
Judging by my stomach,
it's around midnight now.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.940
Let's make a deal.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.690
I'll spare your lives, so let me up now.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.940
Wh-What is he saying?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.340
Is he insane?!

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.540
He's serious.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.300
I think.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.950
What? Are you crazy?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.230
He's the one who should
be begging for his life.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.960
Let me make something clear.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.970
We're after the auction merchandise
that was stored underground.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.960
If you guys don't know where it is,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.320
I have no business with you.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.520
What?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.980
Wait a moment.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.800
You didn't steal the merchandise?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.230
The safe was empty when we arrived.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.590
The Shadow Beasts had
already taken it all.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.240
I guess they didn't bother
telling grunts like you.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.390
I don't think he's lying...

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.350
Then he's serious?

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.000
When he offered to make a
deal, he wasn't bluffing?

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.880
Everyone makes mistakes...

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.380
We haven't stolen anything yet.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.120
So take these off,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.030
and pretend you didn't see anything.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.270
If you do that,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.520
you get to live!

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.370
What about the guests?

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.280
Guests?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.660
The guests who were in the auction hall.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.540
Some of our colleagues were there.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.180
Answer me.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.090
I see.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.040
That's too bad...

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.260
We killed them.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.550
It was part of our plan—

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.390
How many lives do you think you took

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.430
to carry out that plan of yours?!

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.380
Stop, Kurapika!

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.310
Stop it!

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.500
If the merchandise is in safe hands,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.400
we don't need him.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.560
We'll hand him over to the community.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.820
So, no deal?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.280
Oh, did you find out what
became of the merchandise?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.220
Shut up! Ask Feitan!

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.490
Did he tell you where the merchandise is?

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.830
It was no fun...

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.490
I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.840
Oh, so that's it.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.760
Ah, I just remembered.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.170
I was supposed to meet someone today.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.990
I'll be heading out.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.180
Sure, go ahead.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.180
As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.150
Up to some mischief, Hisoka?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.550
But of course.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.040
Damn...

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.190
"Let us meet at the agreed upon place."

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.720
Where's Shalnark?

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.170
He just called.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.720
He's succeeded in locating
a Mafia comms room.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.730
This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.220
We've captured one of the bandits
who attacked the auction

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.760
and wish to hand him over.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.910
Really?

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.460
How did you manage that?

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.490
I can provide further details later.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.570
That's impressive...

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.500
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.790
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.490
Yeah, they were completely wiped out.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.530
Wiped out...

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.250
Well, where are you right now?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.750
Okay, got it.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.040
Move quickly.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah, we'll bring our best people.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.340
I gave him three canisters
of muscle relaxants.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.450
Understood.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.610
The Mafia will be here soon.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.190
I'll watch him until then,
so get some rest, everyone.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.330
Yeah.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.800
You move fast.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.280
<i>He isn't using</i> In.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.670
No need for concern.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.420
I have no interest in fighting you now...

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.550
I'm not here for idle chat!

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.160
Tell me about your organization.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.280
Really?

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.050
I love idle chat.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.550
There are thirteen spiders,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.940
identifiable by their
numbered spider tattoos.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.940
Members can change at
a moment's notice.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.230
An applicant defeating a standing
member replaces them.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.220
If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.910
the boss selects the replacement.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.100
The Troupe focuses primarily
on stealing and killing.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.560
Sometimes, they perform
philanthropic work.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.230
I already know all of that.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.980
Two or three years ago,

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.030
I replaced the man who was #4.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.130
For what purpose?

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.490
So that I could fight the boss.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.940
The boss?

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.520
Why would you want that?

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.280
Because he is strong...

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.690
You wished to test your strength?

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.590
Perhaps.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.070
But...

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.170
It turns me on...

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.700
Thinking about fighting the boss...

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.490
But I've never had the chance.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.580
He never lowers his guard.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.710
At a minimum, two others
always accompany him.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.870
And when a job ends, he vanishes.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.240
Without a trace.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.850
So I reached a conclusion
that benefits us both.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.860
Would you not agree that reaching
our goals alone will be difficult?

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.110
What are you trying to say?

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.480
I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.000
There are seven whose
powers I already know.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.500
Interested...

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.710
in teaming up?

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.510
Yeah, we're on floor B2.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.220
Thanks.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.770
You haven't killed him yet?

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.490
No.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.280
This way.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.760
We couldn't get a needle into him,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.530
so we used paralytic gas.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.540
You clean up nicely.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.270
Huh?

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.080
I couldn't believe my ears

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.760
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.020
Blinky, time for work.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.900
Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.910
Okay, all done.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:47.770
Damn!

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.060
I'm gonna make that chain user pay...

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.480
Wake up, everyone!

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.530
Where is he?!

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.630
He ran away.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.910
You were too loud.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.430
We're heading back.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.990
Our job here is done.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.920
We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.800
And we got our treasure.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.980
No!

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.300
Tell the boss...

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.100
I won't go back until I settle up

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.000
with that chain user.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.820
Uvogin has been freed.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.950
Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up,

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.620
is not yet aware of this.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:15.580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.460
Today, we introduce Dalzollene.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.030
Leads Neon's bodyguards.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.200
He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:15.580
A cruel, impatient man who disposes
of any who fail to follow orders.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.910
Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.060
It's a drag for me, taking care of you.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.920
What are you on about?!

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.920
Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.800
Hey, Killua,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.470
let's play Drop the Handkerchief.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.660
I'll drop it, and you sit and wait.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.250
You can't play that with two people!
