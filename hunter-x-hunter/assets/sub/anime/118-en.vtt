WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
Do it, Knuckle!

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.990
Damn it!

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.770
That bastard...

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.750
He...

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.130
He...

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.470
looked at me like I was trash!

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.780
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.750
Yeah, I got it!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.320
Sorry, master...

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.260
We're both fools.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.790
There's something more important
than the world right now!

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.020
A x False x Rage

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.330
Though the central tower's third floor

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.020
escaped destruction, having been
cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.740
it had been blown slightly to
the left of its original position,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.040
barely keeping the building's appearance intact
while maintaining a precarious balance.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.080
Nearby, in the middle of the
central tower's lower portion,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
which had been reduced to rubble
resembling an ancient gladiator arena...

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.560
I am a foolish servant of the King,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.930
letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.670
That's how I should approach it.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.940
That's the impression I should give them.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.340
Where are you hiding, little rats?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.270
Come out here, so I can squash you!

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.960
I know he'll show himself again...

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.520
To exploit the opening just before I explode.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.870
It's time.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.610
Adding inte—

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.260
Shut up!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.270
While Youpi was allowing a
false rage to consume him,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.040
putting on a show of shouting
in order to draw out Knuckle...

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.270
No matter what happens outside,
my goal is to pin this guy here.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.740
That's all I need to do!

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.790
Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.520
tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.010
maintained just enough distance
as to go unnoticed by Morel

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.470
as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out
his escape from Smoky Jail.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.990
Beneath the northern section of the palace

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.300
Palace

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.300
Border Guard Area F

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.260
was a large area, with warehouses laid
out in the shape of a dragonfly.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:26.790
Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:26.790
Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E
Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.660
Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.950
was where Bizeff had created a private zone

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.790
with his warehouse for hiding women.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.310
Having learned the warehouse's
location from Marcos,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.750
Ikalgo was making his way there by truck

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.300
via a direct, five-kilometer road.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.060
By the time Ikalgo had reached

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.390
the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.970
his Satellite Dragonflies had already
arrived at the warehouse.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.630
The door's open...

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.320
This is a good sign.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.700
Palm put Bizeff to sleep
and headed for the palace.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.500
When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock
the door in his rush to follow her.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.250
That's the likely explanation.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.210
Brovada's in the border guard area?

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.220
This meant that Ikalgo

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.720
had no choice but to face Brovada.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.800
Brovada doesn't trust me.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.580
Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.490
Stay calm...

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.120
Stay calm and figure out what he
knows and what he doesn't,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.820
in order to stay alive!

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.380
What happened during our encounter
that aroused his suspicion?

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.130
Was there something unnatural
about my imitation of Flutter?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.350
I suppose it would be strange for Hagya
to order me to go underground.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.750
But since they didn't stop me on the spot,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.480
my mistake must not have been fatal.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.570
Rather, something aroused an inkling
of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.280
And Brovada's down here because he
wants to confirm those doubts!

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.680
Was it small enough that I can explain?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.280
Or was it big enough that he
only wants final verification?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.210
No room for optimism.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.800
I should assume it was a big mistake.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.020
Is anyone here?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.680
I am a messenger from the secretary!

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.160
Depending on the response...

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.660
No, I have to assume

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.940
that if he has a chance, he'll attack...

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.890
Or he'll kill me!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.750
I am a messenger from the secretary!

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.940
The secretary ordered me to come here!

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.460
Thinker Bell!

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.950
If you're here, you must come with me at once!

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.520
Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.100
This was meant to reassure
Palm that he was an ally.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.760
Why didn't you respond?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.920
Where's everyone else?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.970
I d-don't know anything about
what's happening outside...

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.510
I'm not allowed to talk to anyone
other than the secretary.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.470
She had assumed

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.610
that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.370
The other women thought the same thing.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.240
Each room had a phone exclusively
for communication with Bizeff,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.870
so it was illogical for him to send
a messenger, hence their suspicion.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.420
They believed that a visit from a stranger

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.180
must be a test to see if they could
stay calm and follow orders

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.230
under unusual circumstances,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.000
so they refused to speak to Ikalgo.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.020
However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.570
Is this the place?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:27.400
The women had a much higher chance
of surviving if they stayed here.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:34.480
Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about
keeping them alive, much less protecting them.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.090
<i>There's writing in </i>Nen!

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:46.420
The characters, formed by aura,
could only be seen when using <i>Gyo</i>.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.570
It was less likely that Bizeff

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.110
would find a message that wasn't
on paper or some other device.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.920
"Heading to the palace.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.100
If I don't make contact before the mission,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.440
assume I am dead."

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.440
Ikalgo had expected this.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:13.060
But he still felt as much anguish as
if he had lost part of his own body.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.050
Palm...

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.710
If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.490
use your Satellite Dragonflies and
telepathy to support the team.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.470
Got it.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.680
Pretend that you're reporting
to your Squadron Leader,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.470
when you're actually reporting to Meleoron.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.480
So you want me to feed the enemy lies,
to throw them off?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.980
Yes. It's a crucial task.
I'm counting on you.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.240
That will only be possible

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.880
if they don't know Meleoron is here,
or that I've switched sides.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.230
Which means that, since he
is already suspicious of me,

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.820
I must eliminate Brovada!

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.270
Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.770
Yeah... I did.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.770
Hagya, huh?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.400
Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.600
Okay, the fake is dead.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.240
Empty?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.870
Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.380
The suspect is now dead!

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.910
Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.360
I can move around freely.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.400
Still, I never heard anything about
Hagya changing his name!

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.850
What's he called now?

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.010
It's true that I really knew
nothing of his new name...

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.070
But will they believe that?

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.690
I must think of a reason they'll accept
if I encounter any of them.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.420
No, that won't work!

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.630
Brovada opened fire without warning!

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.170
That shows they think anyone who doesn't
know Hagya's new name is an enemy.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.770
If they find me, there'll be a battle!

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.510
I have to go back up there expecting that!

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.770
Please enter your code number.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.090
The elevator isn't ascending!

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.160
Don't tell me that he came
down here without knowing

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.290
about the passcode system.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.430
This is my chance!

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.890
I have two options to pick from!

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.650
Show yourself!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.220
It's nearly been five minutes since
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.060
Which means the </i>Nen<i> I've
loaned him is nearing 7,000.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.790
Is that enough to guarantee that he won't
pay off the full balance with one hit?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.750
I just...

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.930
I just have to avoid a direct hit.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.640
The worst possible scenario
would be that I'm hit

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.750
by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7
Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.130
If that's gonna happen,

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.720
I'm better off buying time,
waiting for him to go bust.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.110
But that means I'll have to wait

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.510
for at least ten minutes.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.510
Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.910
I have to make him explode once more.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.900
Or else we'll run out of time!

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.940
Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.530
You look happy, monster!

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.540
He fell for my trap, for my false rage.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.190
I've been looking for you, cockroach.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.550
Make this damn fly that's
following me around shut up!

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.550
Damn Fly

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.490
Every time it squeaks,
I'm reminded of your annoying face!

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.480
Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.060
But I'll be faking it...

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.700
It's time.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.180
Adding interest.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.760
Just shut up!

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.550
Right before I explode, I pause for a moment.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.750
He'll try to attack during that opening.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:58.200
But if I stay calm when my rage takes over,
I can control my growth.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.830
Get this thing off me right now...

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.090
Or I'll kill you!

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.950
I'll blow every last one of you
to smithereens, you scum!

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.550
When he tries to take advantage of
the opening I give him, he'll be open.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.550
And I'll take advantage of that.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.970
That won't happen, you giant lump.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.270
You're gonna die on your knees right here.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.120
The next one...

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.620
The next tick of the interest will be the gong.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.260
I'll show you who the cockroach is here.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.900
It's time.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.540
Adding interest.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.260
This will work.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.910
I have time to land one... No, two hits!

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:23.310
I have time to punch him in the face,
and get out of the way before the explosion!

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.820
Take this, pig!

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.930
This one's for Shoot!

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.840
And the next one's also for Shoot!

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.260
Is something wrong with me?

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.740
I was never that close to him...

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.230
Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.920
I don't even know when he
climbed to the rank of "friend"...

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.540
So why am I this desperate to avenge him?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.060
It's not even "vengeance," since he's not dead...

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.830
Well, I guess a lot of it is that
we've faced death together...

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:12.050
Anyone who's risked their
life with you is a friend.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:19.310
But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.690
He ignored someone who entered
a fight with him expecting to die?

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.800
Has he no sympathy as a warrior?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.170
Damn Ant!

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.230
I'm getting more and more pissed off!

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.700
I'll give him a third punch for myself!

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.570
Wow... I'm amazing myself!

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.920
I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.710
And I haven't finished throwing my punch?

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.980
Wait...

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.350
Is this what they mean?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.170
Time's almost frozen.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.290
Everything slows down...

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.220
right before you die?

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.240
He stopped the explosion!

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.260
He got me!

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.750
He was actually keeping his cool...

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.130
I can't stop!

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.620
Sorry, Shoot...

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.760
I screwed up!

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.560
The interest won't be enough to pay for this.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.620
It's over...

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.100
Shoot...

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.680
Boss...

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.810
Everyone...

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.930
Everything is...

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.080
up to you.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.800
Thunderbolt!

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.060
Lightning?

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.940
He's completely paralyzed...

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.690
This is my chance!

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.460
If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.560
I did it! I did it! I did it!

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.020
I'm done! I can't do any more!

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.980
Crap, I almost died!

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.340
I could see the pearly gates...

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.520
My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.140
I hit him eight times!

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.500
What just happened?

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.630
I'm sure he fell for my trap.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.260
What happened?

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.510
That's obvious.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.360
I didn't notice there was an attack
coming from a different direction...

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.740
Is that possible?

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:52.660
That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.770
until it was right over me?

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.030
The same thing happened before.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.150
Before I even realized it,
this little nuisance was on me.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.740
There were no signs at all.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.430
I saw him back at the staircase...

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.690
Did he do it?

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.380
Sorry, but what's about to happen is

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.200
just me blowing off some steam.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.550
Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.840
Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.180
Ika-tta say I'd go with Ikalgo.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.140
Ikan agree with that!
