WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
Heavens Arena.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.990
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.530
When combatants win a fight,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.420
they may advance by one class,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.460
and receive a corresponding reward.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.030
After reaching the 100th floor,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.170
you are assigned a private room.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.550
After reaching the 200th floor,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.010
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.880
This is the best stage

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.890
a warrior could ask for.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.710
Only one thing can protect you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.520
from someone who uses <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.020
You must also learn to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.530
You must use <i>Ten</i> for defense.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.650
Otherwise...

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.750
Your body will be crushed.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.750
Awakening x And x Potential

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.850
As the hour grows late,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.590
Wing's lecture has reached its climax.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.010
But they only have until midnight.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.710
Before that time,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.510
Gon and Killua must learn <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.520
<i>Nen</i> is a power that dwells
within every person.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.840
However, at present,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.340
only a few are capable of using that power.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.490
Thus, they are treated as
geniuses, leaders, psychics,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.540
mystics, or superhumans.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.620
A power that dwells within everyone...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.740
Yes.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.040
And there are two means

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.050
by which to awaken this power.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.510
The deliberate way and the aggressive way.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.550
Zushi underwent the deliberate method.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.560
He was a quick learner, and he trained hard.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000
So he was able to master <i>Ten</i>
in a very short time.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.620
In about six months.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.620
That's too long...

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.570
We need to learn <i>Ten</i>,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.570
and pass Hisoka's <i>Nen</i> barrier before midnight!

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.890
Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.580
Will it be fast enough?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.060
That will depend on you.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.860
Can you learn to hold your aura within
your body, before time runs out?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.540
That is the key.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.060
I will now direct my aura toward you.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.730
This is known as <i>Hatsu</i>,
which I demonstrated earlier.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.840
Naturally, I will restrain myself,
since my objective is not

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.730
to destroy your bodies.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.310
However, this way is still perilous.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.360
In other words, I will attempt
to shock you into awakening.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.450
I will give your sleeping body a jolt,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.370
so you can learn <i>Ten</i> more easily.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.570
I say that your body sleeps because

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.740
your body's openings,
or micropyles, are closed,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.370
meaning that your aura flow is stunted.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.250
Therefore,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.860
I will send my aura into your bodies,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.130
to open your micropyles.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.880
[Micropyles]
Numerous pores in the body,
which release aura.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.020
Under normal circumstances,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.090
you would spend a long time

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.590
meditating and discovering your own auras,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.400
while slowly opening those apertures.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.900
Even Zushi, a natural talent,
required three months.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.530
However, you two could do it in a week.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.160
Or even sooner.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.250
Which is why I find it unfortunate

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.010
that we have such little time to work with.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.550
I don't really get it...

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.050
But quick and dirty is always better.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.060
This is a shady, highly frowned upon method.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.180
You will be ignoring the correct procedure.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.680
You could even die,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.310
if the person using this method
were weak or evil.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.210
But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.030
Right?

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.030
That's why I want to know...

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.540
Shroud   Force
Null
Act

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.040
Why would you

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.540
suddenly decide to teach us the
true four major principles?

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.540
Because I did not want to
squander this opportunity.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.550
If you were to challenge the 200s,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.800
with none of this knowledge,
you would suffer greatly.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.930
Up there, everyone knows
how to manipulate <i>Nen</i>.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.440
And they have a special
greeting for any newcomer

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.940
ignorant of <i>Nen</i>,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.940
a <i>Nen</i> attack.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.490
In other words, they do what I am about to,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.440
but without restraint.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.950
They don't care, even if people die...

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.610
Only those who survive
are allowed to pass.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.950
They are the chosen.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.250
However, they pay a steep price.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.210
That's why I wanted you to be prepared.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.420
Now, despite my attempts to scare you,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.720
I have confidence that this
will awaken your power!

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.910
You have the potential.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.220
As well as the ability.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.690
Put your belongings down,
take off your shirt,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.840
and turn your backs toward me.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.610
It's so hot!

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.460
And I can feel pressure, even though
Wing-san isn't touching me.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.540
This is it! That sensation...

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.710
Like something invisible and slimy,
crawling across my skin.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.760
Amplify this by millions of times,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.140
and it'd feel like my brother's <i>Nen</i> ?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.140
I'll begin.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.660
Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.160
Th-This is...

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.550
That is your aura, or life energy.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.960
You can see it now,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.920
because the micropyles in your
eyes were also opened.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.740
It's like smoke.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.800
Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.800
It's rushing out from every part of my body.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.450
It won't stop gushing out.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.310
Isn't that dangerous?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.000
This is your life energy,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.520
so if it continues to escape,
you will grow tired.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.040
If you expend all your aura,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.820
you will collapse from fatigue.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.570
Really?

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.230
Listen to me.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.450
You must concentrate on keeping
your aura within your body.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.450
Close your eyes!

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.210
Use any stance that helps you to focus.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.220
Then visualize your aura flowing
like blood through your body.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.720
From the top of your head,
to your right shoulder.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.220
To your hand, before passing through
your legs, to the left side.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.300
And now visualize that flow
beginning to ebb

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.980
and hovering around your body.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.000
These boys are incredible.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.420
I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.630
would be the most effective.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.410
With minimal advice, they've already
mastered the technique.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.720
Magnificent...

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.200
And terrifying.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.020
Slowly open your eyes.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.640
How do you feel?

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.650
I feel like I'm surrounded by some
kind of warm mucus.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.800
Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.900
Continue to maintain those images.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.800
Once you've assimilated them,
you'll be able to use <i>Ten</i> while asleep.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.850
Next, I will use hostile <i>Nen</i> against you!

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.910
Previously, it would have

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.510
been painful for you to stand within this.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.300
Yeah,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.520
I understand your blizzard analogy now.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.950
If you can fend off my <i>Nen</i>,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.030
you'll be able to break through his barrier!

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.530
Here I come!

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.450
Welcome to the 200s.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.300
It appears that I needn't bother
with the traditional greeting.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.860
I can guess why you've come
to Heavens Arena.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.360
You intended to train before challenging me...

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.070
Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.330
That saves me time.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.250
You should avoid being overconfident
in your ability to use <i>Ten</i>.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.980
There is much to learn about <i>Nen</i>.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.210
To be honest,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.980
at present, I feel no urge to fight you.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.600
However...

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.750
If you manage to win a single
match in the 200s,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.480
I shall accept your challenge.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.310
Let's go.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.490
Yeah.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.790
Newcomers?

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.430
Looks like it.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.420
Seems that they can use it.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.000
Indeed...

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.140
Welcome to the 200s!

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.600
Please fill out the forms here.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.300
Would you like to register for a match now?

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.940
In this class, there is a self-service system

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.110
by which you're permitted
ninety days of preparation.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.620
You may choose to fight on
any day during that time.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.120
Of course, you're free to fight every day,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.630
and you can also wait until
the very last day to fight.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.830
Once you've participated in a fight,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.760
you have another ninety days to prepare.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.030
However, if you don't fight before
those ninety days end,

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.560
you will be disqualified,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.840
and your name will be struck from all records.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.930
Does that mean we'll be fighting
in this class multiple times?

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.940
Yes,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.680
you need ten wins to clear this floor.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.240
However, if you lose four times before ten wins,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.420
you'll be disqualified.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.410
And

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.700
if you win ten times,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.540
you have a chance to challenge
the Floor Masters!

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.760
The Floor Masters are the twenty-one
strongest fighters here.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.110
Each claims one of the floors,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.820
from 230 to 250.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.250
Do you understand now?

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.370
If you defeat a Floor Master,

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.510
you become the new master of that floor!

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.160
Th-That's not all!

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.690
If you become a Floor Master,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.980
you earn the right to participate in

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.950
the biennial celebration of
combat, Battle Olympia!

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.450
No reaction?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.760
Forget that.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.830
Is there anything special about the top floor?

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.770
That's what you want to know?!

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.740
The champion of Battle Olympia

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.090
gets to live on the top floor!

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.360
It's an incredible honor.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.110
A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground...

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.100
Don't you get it?!

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.050
But Killua's house is 3,700 meters
above ground, right?

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.720
A-And the champion always
receives a prize of...

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.100
What do you wanna do, Gon?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.580
Now that I know the top floor's secret,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.490
I don't care anymore.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.240
Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.500
Why are you kids even here?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.160
Well, then you'll need to win a fight.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.500
But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.420
No...

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.080
I'm doing this!

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.450
I have to find out how different
these opponents are.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.750
I'll need you to fill out this form, as well.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.020
Okay!

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.530
You want something?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.030
No, not really.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.290
We're simply in line to register for a fight.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.920
Oh, I get it.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.170
Gon, these guys want to fight
on the day you do.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.980
I'm ready to go whenever.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.350
There you go.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.990
This boy has plenty of spunk.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.050
Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.600
Killua-sama will be in room 2223.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.720
We will let you know which day your match is.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.860
Thanks!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.340
They must have gone through

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.780
that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.030
If we'd gone in blind,

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.700
we could've ended up like them.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.320
Wow! This room is huge!

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.170
Hey, are you listening to me?

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.160
The bath is squeaky clean.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.820
Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.050
Look, Killua...

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.050
Hey, Gon!

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.060 position:20% line:20%
Your battle has been set
for 3 PM, March 11th!!

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.060
What? Tomorrow?!

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.310
That's fast.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.950
I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.160
But that's okay.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.660
I need the experience.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.910
I need to discover what I
can do with this power.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.390
Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.530
First, we have Gon, who managed

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.420
to zip straight to this class!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.950
His opponent will be Gido,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.250
who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.220
Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.050
Ten is a purely defensive technique.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.570
You have not improved
your offensive capabilities.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.270
Plus, you will still take damage
from physical attacks.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.310
A highly skilled Nen opponent

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.690
will be able to penetrate your Ten,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.880
and deal a lethal blow.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.200
So you should wait two months
before you start fighting.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.200
During that time, I will
teach you as much as I can.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.960
Sorry, Wing-san.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.770
But I'm itching to fight right now!

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.000
Good grief.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.970
That boy is a real handful...

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.640
And...

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.970
Begin!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.950 line:20%
Dancing Tops

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.450
There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.210
He uses numerous tops to
attack his opponent!

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.760
Here we go...

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.960 line:20%
Battle Waltz!

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.540
Clean hit!

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.800
Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.090
and one point, right off the bat!

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.890
He's off to a rough start.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.070
Damn!

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.910
I can use <i>Nen</i>

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.580
to keep these tops spinning
for hours, as my attack.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.500
The attack pattern is so complex,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.540
even I don't know what will come next!

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.550
Tops spinning into each other
and attacking me...

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.440
That small top deals damage
equivalent to a hammer!

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.430
Gon has begun his first battle of the
200s class, which is filled with <i>Nen</i> users.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.090
The 200s class is nothing like he expected.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.720
Can Gon survive this predicament?

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.320
Or not?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.660
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.490
and Killua's

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.280
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.570
It's Gon

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.400
and Killua's

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.920
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:15.580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.810
Today, we introduce Gido!

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.490
A Heavens Arena 200s-class
fighter who is Gon's first
opponent.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.110
He fights with <i>Nen</i>-controlled tops.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.430
He may even turn himself into one, and spin into you!

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.580
An enhancer, who plays
while he fights.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.870
Spin round and round...

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.100
Next time: Fierce x And x Ferocious!

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.780
Don't be too reckless.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.220
A real friend would support
my reckless behavior.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.560
That's just reckless.
