WEBVTT

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.000
What? Intruders?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.010
Dispose of them.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.920
I'm busy right now.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.910
Don't bother me with reports
I don't need to hear!

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.570
Carry on now.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.980
Date x With x Palm

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.910
I don't know which nation sent you.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.610
But having entered this palace,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.460
you must now die painful deaths.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.010
Your Majesty...

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.790
I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.110
This is a rare human.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.930
An appetizing treat.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.460
This is it...

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.840
This is the flavor I sought!

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.160
I feel it.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.600
I feel it! I feel it!

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.960
This is it!

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.720
I can feel power surging through my body!

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.040
Nyow <i>I understand...</i>

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.950
This is the King's power.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.730
He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.610
In other words,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.820
the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.680
Hmm? Who are you people?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.740
Guards!

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.630
What are you incompetents doing?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.480
Worthless.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.000
I can't sense anything.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.010
Insolent thugs!

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.130
Do you know who I am?

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.930
A supreme leader of this era,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.890
a king among kings...

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.400
I am Masador Diego!

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.930
Why does that scum claim to be the king?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.400
In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.280
Humans without intelligence or talent

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.010
end up in positions of power due
to bloodline or connections.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.180
That defies all logic...

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.130
In the hands of an incompetent,
power brings nothing but ruin.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.420
This could only be the work of imbeciles.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.410
We must provide proper guidance.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.420
Absolutely.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.720
However, they serve as quality meat,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.430
and they are a self-renewing resource.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.930
They are an easy food source.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.970
The non-rare humans can be
used to feed our soldiers.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.690
I shall use my godly power
to deal divine punishment!

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.150
Leave at once—

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.520
Allow me to dispose of this.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.400
I can use it to control other humans.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.390
Do as you like.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.460
P-Please!

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.450
S-Spare our lives.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.460
We beg you...

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.700
These humans are idiots.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.720
Think as hard as those weak
brains of yours can manage.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.230
Have you ever spared a pig or a cow

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.550
as it begged for its life?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.740
The view is excellent.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.530
And there is plenty of space.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.570
I dub this place the Meat Plantation.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.520
It will be used for processing humans.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.750
As you command.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.080
After being defeated by Knuckle
and Shoot, Gon and Killua

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.340
return to the inn where Palm waits.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.080
Before I worry about enemies,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.770
I have to protect Gon from Palm.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.900
You must take responsibility.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.430
What?!

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.940
You promised to take me to NGL...

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.410
You said you'd swallow a thousand needles

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.820
if you broke that promise.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.820
Uh-huh, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.300
I don't want an apology...

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.850
But there's no point in having you
swallow a thousand needles.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.870
Yeah.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.330
So what can I do to make up for it?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.020
Let's see...

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.590
You must...

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.690
do any one thing I say.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.520
Hey!

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.200
Right now, do you know how Gon feels—

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.850
Okay, I agree!

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.100
Go out with me.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.600
Go out with me...

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.780
Eh?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.670
Okay.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.720
Huh?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.730
Do you have any idea what you're doing?!

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.620
Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.370
And you have no problem
playing dirty like this?!

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.520
This is none of your business.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.270
It's our problem.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.380
It's up to the two of us.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.390
You should stay away from her, Gon.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.840
Don't interrupt us!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.390
This is something the two
of us must decide alone.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.890
You just want an excuse to say that!

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.380
Just be quiet.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.310
We're going out now...

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.150
There's somewhere I really want to go.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.770
Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.670
Eh?

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.910
Today, I have to train with Killua.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.320
I know!

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.410
You can train with us, Palm!

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.860
Huh?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.420
What are you talking about?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.010
Didn't you say we'd go out?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.420
Uh-huh.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.990
Then, why is he tagging along?

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.480
And why would we train?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.800
Are you toying with me?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.920
This will be a date...

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.680
Our first date!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.440
The first date for us!

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.330
The! First! Date!

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.160
But it isn't a date.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.060
Huh?!

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.440
We can have a proper date later.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.370
Since it's our first date, like you said.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.450
Wow...

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.460
The word "date" keeps popping up.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.520
And I need time to prepare for it, too.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.210
Prepare? Prepare for what?

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.480
That's...

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.710
a secret.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.970
You get to find out tomorrow.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.550
Oh...

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.310
In that case,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.980
it's fine.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.170
Really...

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.100
If you'd explained first,
I wouldn't have been so angry.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.990
Sorry about that.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.740
But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.980
You wanted to surprise me?

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.670
Gosh...

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.930
Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM,
in front of the bulletin board.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.370
I'll be there!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.980
Gon, you're amazing!

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.510
Huh? What do you mean?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.110
Well, listening to you talk to Palm,
you seemed used to this stuff.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.010
Really?

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.540
I was wondering...

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.770
Hmm?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.310
Have you been on a date before?

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.270
Sure, I have.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.570
Well, most of them were with Mito-san.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.750
Oh, that makes sense...

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.610
Wait, who else was there?

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.860
Oh, some of the fishing boats

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.780
that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.580
some of whom only liked younger men...

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.590
So I took them around the village
and had them teach me things.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.140
T-Teach him things?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.790
Th-That means...

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.620
He's a grown-up!

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.470
Women like that were called fanatics.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.070
Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.820
No! Of course not...

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.220
I spent all my time training as an assassin.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.030
And ever since I quit, I've been with you.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.900
Oh, yeah.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.740
Right!

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.620
And I really don't want that to change...

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.120
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.620
Damn, I'm about ready to give in...

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.920
And this was my own decision...

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.140
Hello?

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.140
It's Knuckle.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.560
We've located and secured Kite.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.820
Really? Kite's okay?

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.650
Knuckle?

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:01.660
I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.160
So I wouldn't say that he's okay.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.570
That's fine.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.920
There must be a way to bring him back!

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.610
All right, it'll take three days to get back,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.860
so watch out for any soldier ants.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.060
It seems they've scattered far
and wide, imitating the king.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.240
Got it.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.700
Yes!

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.160
I knew that Kite was alive!

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.330
That's great.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.190
All that's left

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.550
is to protect you for a month.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.480
Wow!

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.560
Look over here!

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.200
I've found a new feeding ground.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.470
There we go.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.850
What's that for?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.730
It's a present for Palm.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.720
Are you sure about this?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.160
If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.490
If I just hand it to her, probably...

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.540
Whatever... Let's get back to town.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.400
Yeah.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.360
If we encounter soldier ants
here, in the mountains,

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.880
we'll be in serious trouble.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:45.430
Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of
encountering ants looking for humans is high.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.890
But while other humans are being
targeted, we can escape.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.850
<i>After all, Gon can't currently use his </i>Nen...

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.350
So I must protect him.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.940
Even if it means sacrificing everything else!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.480
Let's hurry.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.880
Drop your weapon,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.620
place your hands behind your head,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.310
and lie down on the ground!

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.320
If you don't comply within three
seconds, we will open fire.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.690
Three...

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.680
Two...

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.320
One!

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:46.950
Ready...

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.320
Fire!

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.360
He disappeared?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.210
Ow!

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.100
These guys are so slow...

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.110
This is no fun.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.860
On to the next story.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.290
Today, around noon,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.690
an unidentified creature killed
seven people in Pata City.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.870
The creature also injured multiple police
officers who had rushed to the scene,

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.370
before escaping into the Miera Mountains.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.120
According to police testimony,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.620
the creature moved at speeds exceeding
two hundred kilometers per hour.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.750
Before leaving, it said, "I'll return
tomorrow. Bring faster humans,"

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.380
which means it could be a new
species of Magical Beast.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.850
An evacuation has been ordered
for all area residents.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.400
Pata City and the Miera Mountains...

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.130
NGL                                                                                           Republic of
Autonomous                                                                                   Rokario
Region

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.130
Inninge City
Miera Mountains
Pata City
Qwen City
Dory City

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.790
Another city lies between us,

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.590
with the Miera Mountains on the opposite side.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.190
We should be okay...

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.380
The government has requested that
the Hunter Association capture it,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.850
and the Association has accepted.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.140
Next, we have the weather.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.140
I'm done, Killua!

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.460
Tomorrow, we're both on our own.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.210
Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.570
Yeah, right.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.350
I can't ditch Gon when he's
essentially defenseless...

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.310
Gon-kun, over here.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.930
Hmm?

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.580
I didn't recognize you!

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.180
Who are you?!

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.410
Do I look strange?

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.380
Nope, you look really pretty!

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.750
Wait, stop it... You're too loud.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.170
You're embarrassing me...

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.290
What? I'm just telling the truth.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.230
That's enough. Let's go.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.310
Quickly.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.760
Damn...

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.260
What am I doing?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.160
Now I look like the stalker!

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.750
No, don't let it get to me.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.790
I have to protect Gon!

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.800
There's no telling when
the enemy will show up.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.840
How far are they going to go?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.080
Something's there.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.140
This aura is probably from a soldier ant.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.060
It isn't that close,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.420
but it isn't that far, either.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.310
There are faint aura traces around.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.930
Did it already pass through the area?

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.950
Or were they brought here by the wind?

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.310
Either way, there's a high
risk our paths will cross!

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.850
Should I warn them?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.730
We're here.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.550
Eh?

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.490
It's beautiful...

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.240
No,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.940
there's no point in telling them.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.200
<i>Gon can't use his </i>Nen.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.970
If he gets upset about Kite and flies
off the handle with rage, he's finished.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.810
Knowing Palm, she'll definitely
go nuts if I interrupt her date.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.440
If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.100 line:20%
Use this chair.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.010
the nearby ants will notice us.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.640 line:20%
Thank you, I'm fine.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.030
I can't let them know...

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.870
I'll take care of this myself!

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.270
Oh, I thought I smelled a human...

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.340
That's...

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.020
I remember you.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.380
You're one of those kids from before!

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.850
Looks like your luck's run out.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.400
You're about to get a taste of hell.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.060
But it won't last forever.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.400
I moved upwind to catch his attention

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.130
and draw him away from them.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.020
I've done what I had to.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800
But...

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.660
Where's the other kid?

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.630
Once you tell me his location,
I'll give you an easy death.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.070
Well, he can't be that far away...

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.920
He's your buddy, right?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.100
Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.940
I'll just walk around making lots of noise
and swinging your severed head.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.400
Then he'll come to me himself.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.170
Isn't that how humans are?

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.750
He's right.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.860
I have to defeat him,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.700
or it's all over!

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.760
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.770
Next time: Friend x And x Journey.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.800
Going back to Whale Island with Killua...

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.540
Looking up at the stars with Gon.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.520
We're going on a journey!
