WEBVTT

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.040
A field of green.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.940
Stretching as far as I can see...

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.170
I'm being watched.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.680
Someone's out there...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.050
Invitation x And x Friend

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.270
Anyway, I have to wait for Killua.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.700
Yo, sorry to make you wait.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.990
Do you feel something
constantly watching us?

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.140
Yeah, eyes this persistent
can only be a human's.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.960
So everyone's noticed.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.090
Well, they can't be too good
if we can sense them from here.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.580
Just ignore it.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.410
We're being watched.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.060
Killua!

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.980
Sorry.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.200
I don't see any nearby towns.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.470
Yeah, but everyone headed
in the same directions.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.530
They either went this way or that way?

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.420
Huh? How did you know?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.920
Because that's where we're
being watched from.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.220
But we still don't know
why they're watching us.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.240
True.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.240
Well, let's go.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.250
Regardless of who's watching, we should
start by gathering information.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.850
So, how did it go?

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.790
Hmm?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.350
Your save data.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.130
Book.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.130
How many cards were inside?

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.850
There weren't any cards inside.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.260
Huh? For real?

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.110
But there was a message from Ging.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.410
What did he say?

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.400
To enjoy the game.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.000
Enjoy the game?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.590
But this doesn't really feel like a game.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.290
Book.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.710
What do you think about the rules?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.910
I still don't know enough yet.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.330
What was that?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.380
Was it </i>Nen<i>?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.680
This must be your first
time playing this game.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.180
I wonder if you're right.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.640
Since you're carrying a book,
you must be a player.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.430
Well, sure.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.800
You can't fool me.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.500
I know you're new to this game.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.940
Steal
Reveal all free slots of
one target player. (Can
only be used on a player
who's been encountered
within the game.)
[LR][NORM]

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.940
I can use the Steal card.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.450
Casting Steal.
Select target player.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450
What is he doing?!

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.960
Zefespa
Grecoloas
Killua
Gon

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.220
Killua-kun and Gon-kun, huh?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.040
How do you know our names?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.090
How indeed?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.970
You have zero chance if you don't
know about the spell cards.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.790
View Killua's free slots?
Yes      No

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.050
No cards in Killua's free slots.
Steal card was consumed.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.570
And that confirms it.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.910
They're total newbies who just arrived.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.480
And they're kids.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.490
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.490
I don't wanna waste this spell on them.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.120
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.120
Trace should be good enough.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.680
Trace on!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.870
Attack, Killua!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.630
You can't run from spells in this game!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.130
Killua, are you okay?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.630
My attack worked!

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.640
What did you just do to me?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.110
This kid's dangerous!

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.650
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.650
Return on!

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.150
Take me to Masadora!

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.460
Shizuku, Kortopi...

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.210
Do you have a moment?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.090
Play the game?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.340
Yes, would you like to join me?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.220
Once we get home,
there's nothing for us to do.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.420
You really want to clear this game?

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.510
Actually, clearing it isn't my goal.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.730
Then this relates to Troupe business?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.100
More or less.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.430
Understood.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.310
Sure.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.600
Killua, how are you holding up?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.910
Hmm? I don't feel any different.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.680
But I'm still worried.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.120
He definitely did something to you.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.620
No point in worrying about it now.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.840
Hey, was he using <i>Nen</i>
when he said, "Trace on"?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.260
No, it's probably some magic
that only works in the game.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.150
Magic? What kind?

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.300
Beats me.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.430
Well, we'll find out eventually.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.440
Yeah.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.140
Look, there's a town!

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.140
Welcome to Antokiba, City of Prizes

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.400
Are those the prizes?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.150
Wow, all these are prizes?

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.590
Looks that way.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.830
Oh, Killua...

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.530
Look.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.530
"Antokiba Monthly Tournaments Schedule."

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.780
There's a rock-paper-scissors
tournament this month.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.040 position:20% line:20%
September: Rock-Paper-Scissors
Prize: Sword of Truth

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.040
The prize is a Sword of Truth.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.450
Is that an important item?

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.700
Probably.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.420
Look over there.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.580
And over there.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.010
Should we participate?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.300
Of course.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.500
Then let's try to win all kinds of prizes.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.930
We should also gather information.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.450
Welcome!

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.620
If you can finish this within thirty
minutes, you don't need to pay!

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.570
In addition, you'll also receive
a Galgaida as your prize.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.570
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.820
Okay, begin!

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.750
Hey, chef.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.770
Do you know how to use magic?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.140
What's that?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.260
Who's the most knowledgeable
person in this city?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.210
Knowledgeable? What's that?

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.730
This guy doesn't know anything.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.340
He's probably just an in-game character.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.590
Oh, no! You did it!

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.600
Here is your prize, Galgaida.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.100
"1217.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.120
F-185."

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.580
What does that mean?

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.980
Is this your first time seeing a card?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.760
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.390
The left number is the item's card number,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.990
and the sequence on the right
ranks how difficult it is to obtain.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.750
There are ten ranks, from SS to H.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.240
F would be the third easiest.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.750
The number next to the rank is the item's
maximum transformation limit.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.140
Oh, which means this item card...

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.260
Is nothing but junk.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.980
I've never seen him around.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.520
That's brutal.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.900
He's one of the players who entered with us.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.290
Hey, what happened?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.620
His body suddenly exploded.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.030
From the inside.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.370
We've only been inside the
game for a few hours,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.530
and someone's already dead.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.870
And this corpse has a very real presence.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.910
Hard to believe it's a game.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.690
We're risking our lives here.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.470
He disappeared?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.020
He probably went back to the real world.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.670
Game over.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.550
Hey, Killua.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.930
Was the magic used on you earlier...

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.930
I don't know.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.350
Don't worry.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.190
There's no such spell in this game.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.310
Spell?

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.110
As you just said, it's something like magic.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.210
He died from another player's <i>Nen</i>.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.910
<i>Nen</i> ?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.400
Does that mean the players are
trying to kill each other?

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.990
Why?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.610
Player hunting.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.450
Player hunting?

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.670
I can explain later.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.330
Anyway, are you interested in teaming up?

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.170
We know of a sure way to clear this game.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.130
Huh?

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.430
If you're interested, follow me.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.180
My allies are waiting ahead.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.320
What do we do?

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.910
Sounds suspicious.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.400
And we're already off to a bad start.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.440
As I recall,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.170
on your way here, another player
used an attack spell on you.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.870
Have you been watching us?

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.700
Yeah.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.480
And I wasn't the only one.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.140
Lots of people keep an eye
on the starting point.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
If you come, I'll explain why.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.710
I can also tell you about the
spell that was cast on you.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.970
You're being very nice.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.470
There must be a catch.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.970
We have no choice.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.180
This game is difficult,
unpleasant, and frightening.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.920
Once you realize that,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.980
you'll be more willing to accept our offer.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.570
Well, it's your first time playing,

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.110
so you could use the information...

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.270
What makes you think it's our first time?

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.490
We could be returning players.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.320
Book.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.580
This proves that you're beginners.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.490
An experienced player would react
by summoning his own binder.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.670
Because you need spell cards
to defend yourself.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.400
Then the spell cast on Killua...

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.680
Could only be stopped by another card.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.170
Even when you aren't carrying any cards,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.600
you should still summon it.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.260
It's an important bluff.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.100
Book.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.810
Hey, how do we obtain spell cards?

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.070
The easiest method would be to
go to Masadora, City of Magic.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:58.860
Masadora?

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.620
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.620
Return on!

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.370
Take me to Masadora!

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.910
Killua, we should go with him.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.370
I'm worried about the spell on you.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.310
Okay?

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.540
Sure...

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.940
Is this everyone?

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.140
Yeah.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.140
Everyone else turned me down.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.210
Let's get started, then.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.090
Another player was just killed.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.930
He arrived with the rest of you.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.160
His stomach exploded.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.530
It was the Bomber.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.580
The Bomber?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.660
The victims aren't killed by spells.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.090
No spell in this game is capable
of injuring people.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.420
Which means that you won't be harmed or killed

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.680
by any spell that's been cast on you.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.180
There are forty different spells.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.800
The one cast on you was an inspection spell.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.710
Either Trace or Adhesion.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.940
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.120
In short,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.990
once the enemy uses these on you,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.940
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.180
he will then know everything about you.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.390
I get it.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.530
That's why...

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.930
Some players wait near the starting point

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.950
in order to cast these spells on new players.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.060
As soon as a player obtains a valuable card,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.620
they'll show up and steal it.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.580
In some cases, they kill their target.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.470
Like the guy who just died?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.120
I won't be that easy to kill.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.470
No, he was killed by something else.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.560
There is a violent faction hunting players.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.730
This was done by one of them...

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.730
The Bomber.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.170
Bomber...

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.830
In this game, there are three
ways to acquire item cards.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.490
Do you know what they are?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.990
Find them yourself.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.740
Trade with other players.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.160
Steal them from other players.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.250
Yes, those are the three ways.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.900
However,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.750
the number of players stealing
from others has recently increased.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.550
That's due to the card's difficulty to obtain
and the card transformation limit system.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.880
Players who can't obtain cards themselves

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.310
choose to take them from others.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.790
If those players resist, they're killed.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.400
When they die, their ring disappears,
and their cards are lost.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.800
However, it increases the transformation
limit of that type of card.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.350
If you kill a player, you can't take his cards.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.090
That rule was meant to keep
players from killing one another.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.590
But now, it's backfiring.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.710
It's been over ten years since the game's release.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.810
If no one can find a way to beat it,

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.550
the killing will only continue.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.940
That's why we're trying to end this mess.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.050
We're recruiting allies to clear this game.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.810
We need your help.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.310
How do you plan to obtain cards?

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.430
1) Find them yourself.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.060
2) Trade for them.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.090
3) Steal them.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.440
Which method will you use?

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.320
3...

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.620
I assume you mean to use all three methods,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.680
but 3 will be the primary method.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.830
What, so you'll still use force?

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.760
No!

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.450
We won't use violence to reach our goal.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.670
Spells.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.810
You'll use spells.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.580
Am I right?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.080
Correct.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.570
There are certain spells for taking cards,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.950
and there are cards that
defend against those spells.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.600
We'll focus on monopolizing these cards.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.570
We're going to use the very
card transformation limit

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.100
that's frustrated the players.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.180
This is the only way to clear the game.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.100
I have met many players, and they
all reached the same conclusion.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.620
Even if you search for cards,
they'll be taken from you eventually.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.620
Because this game is based on
players taking cards from each other.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.780
We will ensure that we can take
cards from other players,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.790
while mitigating our risk of losing cards.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.720
You're leaving out something important.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.250
Upon clearing the game,
how will you split the reward?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.260
You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.900
So you knew who we were when you invited us.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.600
Yeah.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.630
Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.470
That means the reward will be 50 billion.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.020
We'll split it among everyone who helps.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.730
Currently, we have fifty-three players.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.880
It'll take two months to collect
the remaining spell cards,

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.030
and one month to get the cards we need.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.980
We can finish in three months.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.530
Of course, if you join us,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.520
we'll remove any spells cast on you.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.290
I'm in.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.890
I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.300
But I like the three month schedule
for clearing the game.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.830
What about you?

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.970
I have a question.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.560
If I obtain an SS rank card on
my own, what's my cut?

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.940
Naturally, you'd receive 500 million
for a card of that rank.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.320
Okay, I'm in.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.820
What about you two?

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.070
Killua, sorry.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.070
Hmm? What?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.220
I'm out.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.580
I'm playing this game on my own.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.490
You heard the leader.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.830
I have to pass.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.590
Hey, Gon! Wait up...

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.470
What about you?

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.750
We'll need you to first exit the game,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.810
so the spells placed on you can be removed.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.580
Once you're back in the game,
wait by the starting point.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.310
We'll come get you.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.860
If you have any cards in your free slots,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.760
give them to me now.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.760
Why?

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.000
When you leave the game,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.830
the cards in your free slots disappear.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.310
I believe your data automatically
saves when cards are

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.400
put in or removed from restricted slots.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.350
Yes, but your data disappears

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.460
if you don't return within ten days.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:35.110
If you don't return before then,
we'll assume that you gave up.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.090
Got it?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.100
Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.890
We don't know if anyone's watching.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.350
Let's get started.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.860
Leave
Send one
target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.860
I'll be using the Leave card.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.610
Hey, Gon...

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.810
Will you explain what that was about?

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.680
Sorry, Killua.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.910
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.000
I still don't get why you're apologizing.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.600
But this means you'll be stuck
with that spell for a while.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.800
Oh, that's why.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.260
It's not a big deal.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.130
But you're playing this game

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.770
to help me find my dad...

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.390
You're wrong.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.110
I'm playing this game because...

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.520
Anyway, why were you so mad?

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.050
Because they had nothing
but bad things to say about

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.030
the game Ging made, like how
it's based on killing and stealing.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.850
I want to do what Ging said,
and enjoy the game.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.190
When I first started,

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.040
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.600
That was because I thought all the
players enjoyed playing the game.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.230
People have died.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.840
But it's the player mentality,
not the game, that scares me.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.550
They're willing to hurt others to get cards.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.870
Really?

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.430
I think it makes sense.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.370
Killua, you really mean that?

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.470
That's why this game is meant for Hunters.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.420
But...

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.940
Killing is wrong.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.450
I agree with you on that part.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.510
But what if two players have a fair
fight with predetermined rules,

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.480
and the winner gets to take a card?

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.130
Th-That's acceptable.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.830
See?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.300
When that guy cast a spell on me

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.430
and when those guys carry out their plan,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.840
they're just following the game's rules.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.820
Yeah.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.840
Though it does still feel lame.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.050
Well, forget about them.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.160
Let's enjoy this game.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.480
Killua...

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:46.980
Hmm?

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.980
Thanks.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.630
I'm glad you came with me.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.480
No...

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.630
I'm glad I got to know you!

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.920
Cut it out, stupid.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.790
You're embarrassing me.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.990
Why? I really mean it.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.490
You've got it backwards.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.270
Gon, I should thank you.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.660
I'm the one who's glad

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.910
that I got to know you...

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.910
I understand.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.220
So that's why.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.360
Such a beautiful thing, the friendship
and innocence of two young boys.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.810
I feel like messing with them.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.470
Gon and Killua have
