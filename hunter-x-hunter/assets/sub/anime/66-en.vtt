00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Once someone comes out,
follow their directions.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.220
It's been fun.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.200
Good luck.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.740
Yeah, thank you.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.270
Is this Mikhail's residence?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.000
Go do some shopping at
Dick Sakura, by the station.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.750
At check out, give the cashier this card.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.500
Please come this way, sir.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.020
Strategy x And x Scheme

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.320
There are more people this time.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.870
I wonder if there's anyone I know.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.910
Yo.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.550
Last year, you had your way with us.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.980
But that won't happen again.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.170
We've undergone some hellish training.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.040
Our teamwork is perfect now.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.800
Thank you for coming!

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.800
This year, 1,489 applicants
have made it this far,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.060
but the Phase Two examiner has asked me
to trim that number to about 300.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.760
As for the exam...

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.840
There are two hours before lunch.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.690
Defeat five people before then.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.950
Grab their tags when you defeat them,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.200
and see me when you have all five.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.320
I'll wait on the other side of the door.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.500
Got it?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.580
As soon as I shut the door,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.580
you may start.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.840
Every stage of the exam should be like this...

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.630
You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.670
Oh, you're here!

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.620
Killu—

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.860
Sucks for you.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.440
I'm the only one passing this year.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.820
He's totally out of our league...

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.120
So that's what it takes to
become a top Hunter...

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.640
This will be the last time I
attempt the Hunter Exam...

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.950
We finally have our first applicant.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.160
That took an hour and a half.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.680
What happened to everyone else?

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.330
They're all asleep.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.910
It took me a while to collect all their tags.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.300
Is there going to be a second stage?

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.390
That won't be necessary.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.680
He's demonstrated his skill.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.320
Killua, denizen of the darkness...

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.000
He's returned much stronger.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.030
Applicant 1219, Killua-kun.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.960
Yeah.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.460
You've passed

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.480
the Hunter Exam!

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.190
Welcome back, Killua.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.370
How was the exam?

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.520
I passed it in no time, naturally.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.440
Yay!

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.030
Sorry to interrupt your celebration,
but look at these spell cards.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.040
Wow...

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.990
There's even an S-rank card!

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.110
How much can we sell it for?

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.010
Oh, let's go ask around!

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.540
No, we should use it wisely.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.740
So what should we do?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.110
Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.190
With all these defensive spells,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.300
we don't need to worry
about it getting stolen.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.690
Have you tried any of these?

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.650
Just Blackout Curtain.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.780
What?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.930
If you have all these cards,
you should use them...

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.730
Start by using this one.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.020
You can choose a player you've
met before, and talk to them.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.020
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book.
(Connection maintained for
a maximum of 3 minutes.
May only be broken by
player who used this card.)
[LR][NORM]

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.090
Who should we talk to?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.030
We won't know until we see who's available.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.030
Contact on!

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.660
Oh, I see a lot of names.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840
Hey, Gon...

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.560
When did you run into him?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.450
Huh?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.010
Chrollo Lucilfer

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.570
Chrollo?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.120
Who's Chrollo?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.210
I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.050
Does that mean you guys passed
each other without noticing?

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.640
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.260
That doesn't make sense.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.020
Kurapika sealed his <i>Nen</i>.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.900
Yeah, and you have to use
<i>Nen</i> to enter the game.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.620
Who's Kurapika?!

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.320
That only leaves...

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.630
Let me in on this!

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.330
I get it. So that's what's going on.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.250
Hey, Shal...

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.430
Stop laughing, and explain
what this is about.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.830
Sorry about that.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.710
Chrollo Lucilfer

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.710
This probably isn't the boss.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.840
He hasn't purged the <i>Nen</i> from his body.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.200
Purging <i>Nen</i>?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.090
It's very doable.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.050
Seriously?

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.170
Of course!

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.960
If you can place <i>Nen</i> on others,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.350
it's not unreasonable to think
<i>Nen</i> can be removed, as well.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.100
Does that mean Chrollo has removed
Kurapika's <i>Nen</i>, and entered the game?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.860
Why would he be here?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500
I'm not sure,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.670
but we should probably let Kurapika know.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.600
I'll leave the game real quick.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.740
You can use a spell card to leave.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.800
Save it.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.440
I can be out and back in four hours.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.240
I should have realized this sooner...

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.000
Yorknew City                                        Greed Island

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.000
This island is directly east of Yorknew City.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.340
East is the direction to go.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.190
You will find one who awaits you.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.800
I see.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.600
So the boss came here to find
someone to purge that <i>Nen</i>.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.760
The boss arrived the same way we did,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.260
but then Razor kicked him out.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.790
That was when he realized
this was Greed Island.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.840
But since the boss can't use <i>Nen</i>,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.400
he can't enter the island
via the usual channels.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.160
So he must have hired someone
to come to this island for him.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.750
He had them use his name
as a hidden message to us.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.010
The one who can purge this
<i>Nen</i> is on Greed Island.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.550
Change in plans again...

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.860
Let's bring everyone else here.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.290
Yes, we'll all start looking
for this <i>Nen</i> exorcist.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.170
I have a small correction.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.990
You're...

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.900
Hisoka!

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.640
It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.690
Because I didn't know you could
enter any name you like

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.710
until I was already inside...

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.390
You should praise my initiative.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.580
Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.010
Ah, so that's what this is about.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.330
I'm dying to kill you right here and now,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.260
but I'll let the boss do that.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.550
Well, if anything comes up,
use Contact to get in touch.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.020
If I learn anything new, I'll let you know.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.280
Bye.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.230
So the boss hired Hisoka...

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.820
He probably didn't have much
choice, but it's still weird.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.060
And his reward is probably a duel,
once the boss is cleansed.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.150
But now, it's only a matter of time

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.810
until the boss comes back!

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.910
I doubt it.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.700
I would know at once

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.660
if <i>Nen</i> I placed on a spider
had been removed.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.370
So when you chose your power, you
knew something like this might happen?

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.810
Of course...

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.230
If you're able to place <i>Nen</i> on others,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.350
it only makes sense to assume

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.810
that one can also remove <i>Nen</i>.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.500
Well, now you know.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.060
What you do from here is up to you.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.010
Thanks for taking the trouble.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.340
You have my gratitude.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.740
Did you need anything?

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.690
What am I...

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.430
What am I supposed to do this month?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.570
Tell me...

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.950
What should I do?

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.150
It'll be fine. Let me handle...

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.710
What could you possibly know?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.990
You have no idea what's going
to happen to us now!

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.990
Neon... I need Neon!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.800
Restore Neon at once!

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.020
Damn! Why did this happen?

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.870
I wonder what's wrong...

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.000
Why did it stop working?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.990
See ya.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.430
Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.500
Oh...

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.380
Kurapika was pretty calm about it.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.460
Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.010
Well, it sounds like you
got worried for nothing.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.260
Now it's time to focus on yourselves.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.300
Osu!

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.800
Start with the basics...

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.760
We're not going to train.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.650
It's time to start

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.530
beating this game!

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.150
It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.080
lives only on this tree!

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.120
There's only one way to capture it!

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.450
Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.370
First comes rock!

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.160
Rock, paper...

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.770
Rock!

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.840
Wow!

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.630
It's raining bugs!

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.270
Found it.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.370
Difficulty rank A!

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.140
King Great White Beetle
A legendary insect that
releases pheromones
which attract other insects
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony
for brief evening walks.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.040
That's three King Great White Beetle cards!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.270
You could've gotten more if
you'd thrown a real punch.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.990
Well, I didn't want to damage the tree.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.280
There is no such girl in this mansion.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.930
Even if there were, it would be impossible

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.830
for you to bypass all the traps and find her.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.280
Found her.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.140
She was in a hidden room,
four floors underground.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.910
What?

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.540
Curse you!

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.170
Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.790
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
Very shy and quiet.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.050
The guard was a rank F.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.640
Next, let's head to the
City of Gambling, Dorias!

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.440
Wait, wasn't today supposed to be

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.360
the monthly contest in Antokiba?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.560
We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.560
Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.560
A Paladin's Necklace! Score!

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.560
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.850
I don't understand this description.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.820
We can ask one of the shopkeepers.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.430
When you wear this necklace,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.950
you can reflect all attack spells.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.550
And if you touch cards under the

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.930 position:80% line:20%
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.960 position:80% line:20%
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.960
effects of Transform or Fake,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.340
you can restore them to their original state.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.990
Wow...

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.300
If we wear this, we won't have to
worry about losing any cards.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.990
Memory Helmet...

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.070
Memory Helmet
A player will always remember
everything seen or heard
while wearing this item.
Unfortunately, helmet is
very large and heavy.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.370
Witch's Love Potion.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.570
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.010
Risky Dice.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.200
Risky Dice
A 20-sided die. One side says
Bad Luck, while the other nineteen
say Good Luck. If player rolls
Good Luck, something good will
happen. But if player rolls Bad Luck,
something bad will happen to cancel
out everything that was good.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.130
King Great White Beetle.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.240
King Great White Beetle
A legendary insect that
releases pheromones
which attract other insects
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony
for brief evening walks.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.660
Gold Dust Girl.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.330
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
Very shy and quiet.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.230
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.230
Paladin's Necklace.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.400
A total of six different restricted slot cards!

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.890
Piece of cake!

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.720
Piece of cake?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.980
Not in the least.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.520
This was only possible because you
underwent that grueling training.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.990
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.040
Yo. It's been a while, Gon.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.720
Who are you?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.320
You don't remember me?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.000
Do you remember the player

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.990
who took the Sword of Truth
from you in Antokiba?

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.010
What do you want?

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.500
Up for a trade?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.810
I have #66, Witch's Diet Pill,
and #17, VIP Multi-Pass.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.430
You can talk it over with your friends.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.070
What do you think?

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.700
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.470
It's Tsezgerra.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.630
You again?

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.780
Interested in trading your

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.730
Breath of Archangel for our Patch of Forest?

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.210
It's an SS-rank card.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.680
No way.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.870
I've already said I won't
deal with you people.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.020
What if I throw in a Clone?

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.720
I'm telling you that there's no deal here.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.030
You already have ninety-two different cards.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.930
All that's left

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.890
are the cards monopolized
by other players, yes?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.140
Actually, we have ninety-five...

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.110
And you probably have many items
that you haven't used Gain on yet.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.490
It's possible that Breath of Archangel
is the final card you need.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.440
If we give that to you, we'll lose.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.870
Stop playing dumb.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.010
I know that you're monopolizing

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.130
both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.290
This game isn't over yet.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.130
I see.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.480
Good luck, then.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.420
But we'll never let you have these cards.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.390
What if I offer three cards?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.110
We'll give you Patch of Forest,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.670
Patch of Forest
The entrance to an enormous
forest known as the Mountain
God's Garden. Many species
exist only in this forest.
All are friendly to humans.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.420
Hidden Hollow
Upon entering and exiting hollow,
player will be transported to a
desolate location. However, player can
return to original location
without spending any money.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.870
Hidden Hollow,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.270
Palmtop Dragon
As the name implies, this dragon
fits on your palm. Willingly obeys
its master. If raised lovingly,
it can learn to speak.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.270
and Palmtop Dragon.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.280
And you only have to give us Night Jade,
not Breath of Archangel.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.430
We'd be giving you one SS-rank
card and two S-rank cards,

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.750
while you'd only give up one A-rank card.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.790
I believe this deal is too good to pass up.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.890
Give us some time to discuss this.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.370
Just to be clear, this is our final offer.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.110
We won't accept any further negotiation.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.500
Book.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.510
It's gotta be a trap.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.190
That offer's too good.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.620
Tsezgerra is a careful man.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.680
He wouldn't try to pick a fight.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.610
But at the same time, he would
never make a losing deal.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.190
Breath of Archangel
An angel who can cure any mortal
injury or terminal disease with one breath.
However, angel will appear only once.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.930
Meaning that he thinks

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.190
he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.110
Does that mean they've assembled
all forty spell card types?

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.500
It's possible.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.200
So they're waiting for Gain to be
used on a Breath of Archangel.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:18.710
Night Jade
A jewel blessed by the devil.
When the holder is in danger,
peril will be shifted to another.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.050
On the other hand, Night Jade is a card

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.660
that we monopolized through hard work.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.500
If one of the cards were to be destroyed,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.960
one of our jade jewels would
automatically turn into a card.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.080
Which means the A-rank
Night Jade is much harder

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.220
for them to get than the
SS-rank Breath of Archangel.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.150
This is a gamble.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.730
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.730
VIP Multi-Pass
Present this pass to gain
entry into any location.
Contains 1000 passes.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.590
Book.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.620
See ya.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.430
That was uneventful.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.180
Kind of disappointing.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.100
I was so nervous...

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.250
But now we've gathered
seven types, in three days!

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.450
We're making decent progress.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.930
Okay, let's keep this up.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.920
Are there any other events in the city
for getting restricted slot cards?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.260
Hmm... I think there are...

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.090
Prizes from the slot machines?

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.020
Should've expected as much from
Dorias, the City of Gambling.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.200
You have a 0.01% chance of winning.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.000
That's one in ten thousand tries.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.540
So it all comes down to luck.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.230
Pretty risky.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.740
I know, Gon!

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.660
Use that dice!

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.260
This is it...

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.160
If we get Good Luck, we can win!

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.420
But if you get Bad Luck,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.740
something bad will happen that cancels out

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.300
everything good that's happened.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.170
There's only a one in twenty
chance of getting Bad Luck.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.470
There!

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.550
Next, we try the slot machine!

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.010
Awesome! One try!

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.390
Rainbow Diamond
A diamond that glitters like
a rainbow. If this diamond
is presented when proposing,
you will never be turned down.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.390
A Rainbow Diamond! Score!

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.260
That's what I thought...

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.640
This die is the key to winning in this city.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.950
But if you roll Bad Luck, it could be scary.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.520
Don't worry.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.180
It can't kill me...

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.160
Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.220
I knew something was wrong.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.910
That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.400
And he was acting weird...

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.310
He kept rolling a funny-looking die.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.290
Yikes, his face is mush...

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.300
Anyway, let's make the trade.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.090
Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S
and above as quickly as possible.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.890
Yeah.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.060
As for cards rank A and below...

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.080
Roll.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.310
S-Spare me...

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.040
This is only your third time.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.190
You'll be fine.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.220
I-I know someone who got
Bad Luck on the first roll and died!

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.930
If I roll Bad Luck,

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.860
I'll be hit for every Good Luck
that the other players rolled!

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.120
Not my problem.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.330
Roll.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.150
Or would you rather die right now?

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.680
Come on...

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.840
See?

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.270
It's pretty rare to get Bad Luck.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.020
Now we use the Lottery card.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.690
We want #75, Lucky Alexandrite.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.280
If you obtain one, we'll set you free.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.240
C-Come on...

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.630
Lottery on!

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.940
Well?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.430
#76!

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.270
So close!

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.270
Your luck sucks.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.020
Okay, one more time!

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.770
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.980
Time for Motarike-kun to
show us what he's got!

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.440
No good, huh?

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.700
Hey, Gen.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.930
Should we make the first move?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.520
I already told you that combat
should be our last resort.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.440
It's too early for that.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.940
No, we're trying to stay
one step ahead of them.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.530
Though, once we commit,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.190
further negotiation will be impossible.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.200
What do you have in mind?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.950
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.820
We use Tax Collector's Gauntlet,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.950
combined with Risky Dice.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.380
I understand.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.990
We use this to steal eight cards
from them immediately...

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.460
But it's definitely dangerous.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.870
If someone rolls Bad Luck, they'll probably die.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.030
But this job is too important to leave to them.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.470
We can do this!

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.430
We've come this far.
Let's clear the game.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.730
Hey, Gen...

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.460
What are you up to?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.260
I've told you this many times.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.630
When taking a risk, we three share the danger.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.030
It's Tsezgerra.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.370
Have you reached a decision?

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.860
Okay, you have a deal.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.890
I can do this...

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.470
One more time!

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.270
I said I can do this,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.690
so I'm gonna do it!

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.350
Okay, let's move on to the next city!

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.440
Gon's team has begun
working to beat the game.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.470
The story is nearing its climax.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.260
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.390
Today, we introduce the card Lottery.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:14.870
Lottery
Change this card
into a random item card.
[SR][NORM]

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.370
When you use this card,
it changes into a random card.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.360
That's why it's effective to use with Risky Dice.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.880
Next time: 15 X 15.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.130
Hey, Killua, is this fifteen?

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.470
What did you think it was?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.810
One five.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.400
Cute, huh...
