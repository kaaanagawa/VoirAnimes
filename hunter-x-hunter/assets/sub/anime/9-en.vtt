WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.260
I...

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.760
I give!

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.640
Huh?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.510
What?

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.760
Bastard...

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.020
You just confirmed all my suspicions!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.060
You're a worthless piece of trash,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.520
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.270
Exactly.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.310
That's what I do every year.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.020
And I plan to continue the tradition.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.030
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.040
Beware x Of x Prisoners

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.610
The Third Phase of the exam is
taking place at Trick Tower,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.980
a prison for long-term prisoners.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.210
Gon and his friends have chosen to partake

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.180
in a five-on-five battle with
some of the prisoners.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.190
Due to Tonpa's actions,
they've already suffered one loss.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.190
The next round

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.250
will pit Gon against Sedokan.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.790
What will happen in the upcoming battle?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.790
Now, then...

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.450
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.450
As you can see, I'm not very strong.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.550
I don't really enjoy fistfights

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.140
or other physical activities,
such as running and jumping.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.550
I do.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.660
But I'm not too good at using my head.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.960
As I thought.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.470
So I came up with a simple game
we could both play.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.820
A game?

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.710
Yes.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.760
It doesn't rely on either mental
or physical activity.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.980
What kind of game?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.640
We each light a candle at the same time.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.540
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.490
What do you think?

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.570
Yeah! That's easy to understand.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.100
Let's go with that.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.120
Okay. In that case...

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880
...decide which candle you want to use.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.010
Press O for the long one,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.240
or X for the short one.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.890
This will be determined
by majority rule.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.670
We have to choose one?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.770
This is a trap!

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.550
Normally, you'd choose the long one,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.570
so he must have done something
to the long one!

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.680
That would be the safe assumption.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.420
But it might be a trick,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.970
and he's actually tampered
with the short one.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.890
When you put it like that...

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.040
Yes, there is no end...

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.930
You've got a real dilemma there.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.650
You keep your mouth shut!

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.670
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.670
When presented with a
clearly uneven choice,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.180
people become suspicious and
hesitate before deciding.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.680
Yes, this is a real dilemma.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.490
What's worse, if you make the wrong choice,
the resulting mental anguish

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.870
would be much greater than if the problem
had offered two fair options.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.510
Take your time.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.960
This may be a majority decision,
but you're free to discuss it.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.460
We have plenty of time.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.150
Hmm...

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.960
Hey, which one should I choose?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.650
Damn...

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.470
Which one should we take?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.610
Gon, you decide!

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.630
We'll abide by your decision.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.340
Choose the one you think is best.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.960
Are you sure about this?

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.870
He never thinks anything through.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.490
Instead of wasting time fretting
over what to do,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.990
let's rely on Gon's instincts.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.880
Instincts, huh...

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.660
I get to choose?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.900
Okay!

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.880
Then I choose the long one!

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.390
You want the long candle?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.890
Because a longer candle
will burn a longer time!

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.240
Er, he's just taking it at face value?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.150
I knew he wouldn't think this through.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.610
Well, that's that.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.390
It's not like we can figure out
which one is the trap.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.790
Okay.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.490
You get the long one.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.290
I'll take the short one.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.760
Now, we light our candles together.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040
Normally,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.040
how long would it take that
candle to burn down?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.300
Five to six hours?

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.060
Whoa... That was close.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.560
A strong wind is coming from below.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.620
That means we should watch our step...

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.570
No time to relax, huh...

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.710
If you don't pay attention,
your candle will go out.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.510
That's because you're planning
to do something bad.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.470
Otherwise, your candle would go out first.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.090
I won't do anything.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.970
After all...

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.970
I've already taken steps.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.480
See?

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.590
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.840
The flame suddenly became stronger!

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.000
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.910
to make the candle burn faster!

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.430
H-Hot...

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.930
At this rate, his candle will only last
another two or three minutes.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.010
Damn!

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.480
Hey! That was dirty!

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.260
I knew you tampered with
the long candle!

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.270
<i>Heh, you're wrong.</i>

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.650
<i>I had four candles prepared.</i>

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.560
<i>The dilemma you faced was mere</i>

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.030
<i>camouflage for the actual trap.</i>

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.780
<i>You were given the impression that only
one candle had been interfered with.</i>

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.520
<i>The choices were so uneven,
you didn't consider</i>

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.790
<i>the possibility that both had been.</i>

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.050
<i>It didn't matter which candle you picked.</i>

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.250
<i>Either way, I would have handed you</i>

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.550
<i>an oil-soaked candle.</i>

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.060
If the fire is stronger,

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.190
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.610
He's fast!

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.120
I win!

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.880
Yes!

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.890
Oh, he has a real spring to his step.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.960
And the ability to take advantage
of a bad situation.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.890
I'm impressed by this boy.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.470
Yay! I won!

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.020
Good job, Gon!

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.400
Now we have a win!

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.690
Once Kurapika and I win,
we can advance!

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.310
Hmph, you fool.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.910
That's the result of reliance on
tools and cheap tricks.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.910
Tsk.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.990
If you want to fool someone,
you have to sacrifice a bit.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.420
Just watch.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.780
All right.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.430
I'll go next.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:50.150
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.150
Lippo

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.640
I'm next!

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.160
Majitani
108-year sentence, multiple crimes, including fraud and blackmail

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.410
That's one freaky body...

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.410
And face...

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.410
Look here!

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.260
I've killed nineteen people,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.420
but it bugs me that nineteen is
such an uneven number.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.930
I'm so glad I've gotten to
meet number twenty.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.560
Now we have a serial killer?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.950
I insist that we put our lives on the line.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.570
I won't accept some half-assed contest.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.070
Blood!

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.070
Entrails!

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.570
Agony!

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.250
<i>Well?</i>

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.080
<i>You must be scared now...</i>

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.050
Very well.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.080
Huh?

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.710
You can decide how we
settle this contest.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.440
I'll agree to your choice.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.190
O-Oh...

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.970
You've got balls.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.420
<i>Hmph...</i>

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.150
<i>I know you're quaking in your boots.</i>

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.720
<i>How long can you maintain
the tough guy act?</i>

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.530
In that case, I also propose

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.500
a death match, where we fight until

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.820
one of us surrenders or dies.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.640
However, don't expect me to stop

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.200
when you surrender and
beg for your life!

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.580
<i>Well?</i>

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.740
<i>Surely you're scared stiff now?</i>

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.640
Very well. I accept.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.250
<i>Huh?</i>

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.760
Let us begin.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.630
<i>Is he an idiot?</i>

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.580
<i>Didn't he hear what I said?</i>

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.770
<i>We're fighting to the death!</i>

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.770
<i>Wait, he should have been scared
once he saw me!</i>

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.580
Hold on.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.280
I forgot to mention something.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.260
No weapons allowed.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.780
We'll beat each other to death
with our fists.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.750
After all, while I may be hired as
an examiner, I'm still a prisoner.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.620
I'm not allowed to carry weapons.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.530
I see.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.290
I understand.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.430
Anything else?

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.650
If not, I'd like to get started.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.760
Huh?

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.850
<i>That little bastard...</i>

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.290
<i>He had a concealed weapon!</i>

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.320
<i>That was close.</i>

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.670
<i>However, it appears that
he doesn't rely on it.</i>

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.560
<i>He's that confident in his fighting ability?</i>

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.530
<i>No, that doesn't seem to be the case.</i>

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.500
<i>Hmph, maybe he wants to run,</i>

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.220
<i>but he can't in front of his friends.</i>

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:57.460
<i>Or he's so stupid, he can't even imagine</i>

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.080
<i>how scary I am?</i>

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.090
<i>Yes! That must be it...</i>

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.960
<i>Well, in that case,</i>

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.600
<i>I have a couple of cards up my sleeve
for dealing with such fools.</i>

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.160
Hey, now.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.970
Is Kurapika gonna be okay?

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.610
This guy looks dangerous.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.120
<i>In what way does he look dangerous?</i>

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.320
<i>As far as I can tell,</i>

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.210
<i>this guy's just a blowhard who
doesn't have the guts</i>

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.130
<i>to hit anyone, let alone kill anyone.</i>

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.400
You don't need to worry.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.130
Huh?

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.720
Why not?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.960
Because when I look at him,
I don't get chills.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.140
What does that mean?

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.650
Time to show you the ace up my sleeve!

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.850
I'll see you dead!

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.860
Here he comes!

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.550
Wow...

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.790
He made a hole in the floor
with his bare fist!

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.260
<i>That was perfect...</i>

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.800
<i>And I still have one more trick.</i>

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.860
A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.030
That's...

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.530
Yeah, I recognize it.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.030
Anyone aspiring to become
a Hunter has heard of it.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.160
That's the symbol worn by members of
that notorious band of evil thieves,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.940
the Phantom Troupe!

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.950
Really?

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.510
Yeah, definitely.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.050
They're famous.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.050
I heard about them
straight from Kurapika.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.070
<i>Between the steel implanted in my body</i>

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.520
<i>that gives my arms
the strength to shatter rock,</i>

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.580
<i>and the Phantom Troupe symbol...</i>

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.580
<i>After seeing both,</i>

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.260
<i>no one would want to fight me!</i>

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.580
What's wrong?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.470
Cat got your tongue?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.790
I'm Majitani, one of the
Phantom Troupe's four kings!

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.100
Consider that first strike
my way of saying hello.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.840
This is your last chance to surrender.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.070
I'm still willing to...

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.520
Huh?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.540
Wh-What's wrong with you?

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.040
<i>Huh?</i>

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.500
<i>Wh-What?</i>

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.010
O-O-Okay...

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.750
Wait! I get it!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.750
I surrender!

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.960
Consider this a warning...

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.970
First,

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.560
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.520
Second,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.550
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.030
Third,

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.030
never mention the Troupe again.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.340
If you do,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.420
I'll kill you.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.520
Wow...

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.250
Kurapika...

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.990
Well, saw that coming
from a mile away.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.250
Yup...

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.930
You okay, Kurapika?

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.690
Yeah, I'm not injured.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.130
Also,

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.490
is it safe for us to be near you?

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:21.780
From the moment I saw him,
I knew he was weak.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.260
And mentally, I knew that
tattoo was a fake.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.150
But as soon as I saw that spider,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.790
everything in my sight turned red...

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.960
Well, I can't really blame you.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.890
Actually, to tell the truth...

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.800
Hmm?

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.040
Even when I see a real spider,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.810
my personality changes,
and I enter a frenzy.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.810
You should have told us sooner...

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.130
But this means that

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:57.290
the rage in me remains
as strong as ever.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.780
I suppose I should be happy.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.060
We should keep Kurapika
away from spiders.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.220
Definitely.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.790
Damn you, Majitani...

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.580
You were completely worthless.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.500
His facial scars were from a botched
plastic surgery operation.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.590
That's one hell of a fraud.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.440
Hey, you understand, right?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.760
After two losses, our backs
are against the wall.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.100
Let me handle it.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.920
I have a good idea.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.610
Okay! I'll secure our victory!

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.610
Kurapika has defeated Majitani.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:45.200
Another win, and they
will clear this trial.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.170
How will Leorio handle

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.670
the next challenge?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.780
Next time: Trick x To The x Trick!

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.680
The trick to the trick is to trick...
I can't say it.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.050
Don't just give up.
