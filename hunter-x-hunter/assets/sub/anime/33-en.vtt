00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.490

A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010

A technique to create an
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.

These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

Four Major Principles

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.560
Gon,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.060
we need to learn more about <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.990
Yeah!

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.820
An x Empty x Threat

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.870
After two months, during which Gon
was forbidden to practice <i>Nen</i>,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.240
Wing has summoned Gon
and Killua to see him.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.090
Gon-kun. Killua-kun.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.680
Starting today, you'll train with Zushi.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880
Gon-kun, I'm pleased

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.100
that you kept your word.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.210
It's thanks to your promise thread.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.850
A few times, I almost gave in.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.060
But when I looked at the thread,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.610
I was able to control myself.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.280
That's because I added some <i>Nen</i> to help you.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.740
Huh? Really?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.990
No, I was lying.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.490
Huh?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.330
But how could you tell that he kept his word?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.790
He could have been practicing in secret.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.500
Because the promise thread remained intact.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.110
Gon-kun, it's been a while,
but would you try using <i>Ten</i> ?

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.040
It's okay?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.010
Yes.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.510
Crap, do I remember how to do this?

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.590
It's been so long.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.770
Can I still pull it off?

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.620
Zushi, what do you think?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.620
I-It's amazing!

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.530
His aura is flowing all around him!

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.840
Soft and calm...

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.720
But it's very strong!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.980
I did it!

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.210
Whew...

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.050
I was worried that I might
have forgotten how.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.080
Once you've learned the technique,
you can't forget it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.930
However, to become a master,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.300
you'll have to train hard.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.900
But it felt easier than before,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.690
despite not having been practicing <i>Ten</i>.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.310
That's because

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.390
you were training your spirit each day.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.690
Now, look at your left hand.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.480
Huh?

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.550
It snapped!

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.800
By applying my own <i>Nen</i>,
I tied the thread such that

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.930
if you broke your promise and used <i>Nen</i>,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.450
it would snap.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.750
That's actually possible?

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.030
Hey, Wing-san...

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.960
Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.840
Yes, I did.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.900
What was the ability that Hisoka used?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.460
Could we send loose limbs flying around?

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.930
Hmm, that's a difficult question.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.470
Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.690
No, not yet.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.230
Then I'll explain while we watch.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.910
Can you see the threads of aura
extending from his left hand?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.370
Threads of aura?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.520
Yes.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.870
Do you see them?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.170
N-Nope.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.050
I can't see a thing.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.380
Same here.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.840
Are there really threads of aura

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.640
coming from Hisoka's left hand?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.450
Yes, Hisoka is using a technique

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.900
that makes his aura difficult to perceive.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.980
Null

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.400
It's a high-level application of <i>Zetsu</i>, known as <i>In</i>.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.400 line:20%
Hide

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.000
When you use <i>In</i>,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.900
even the strongest opponents will
find it hard to see your aura.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.900
The most effective counter to this technique

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.950
Enhance

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.370
is to focus the aura created by <i>Ren</i>

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.790
into your eyes, a technique called <i>Gyo</i>.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.790
Focus

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.440
The method Gon-kun used
in his fight with Gido

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.230
might work, as well.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.270
However, you couldn't take offensive action,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.380
so ultimately, you'd throw your life away.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.680
Right.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.940
My assignment for you two

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.440
is to practice <i>Ren</i> until you
can see through Hisoka's <i>In</i>.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.250
Eh?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.250
Uh, master?

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.140
What should I do?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.240
Zushi,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.150
you should already be strong
enough to see past his <i>In</i>.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.730
I should?

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.110
Show them your <i>Ren</i>.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.770
O-Osu!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.010
Ren!

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.230
It's so strong.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.730
It doesn't have a much greater magnitude,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.930
but it's very dense.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.950
Then direct that aura into your eyes.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.930
Osu!

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200
Gyo!

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.200
So, can you see the aura that emanates

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.700
from Hisoka's body?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.460
Yes.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.470
And how many threads are there?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.960
Twelve...

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.720
No, I think it's thirteen.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.500
Not quite.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.470
But you were close.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.010
I could really see them!

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.670
You're making excellent progress, Zushi.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.040
O-Osu...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.600
Thank you very much.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.970
By channeling all your power through <i>Gyo</i>,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.110
you achieved a level where you
could see through Hisoka's <i>In</i>.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.130
But with enough training,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.380
you'll be able to use <i>Gyo</i> while fighting.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.610
Do you understand?

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.480
First, practice <i>Ren</i>,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.830
and master the <i>Ren</i> application known as <i>Gyo</i>.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.580
Then you'll discover the true nature

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.840
of Hisoka's ability.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.030
And will you be able to use that same ability?

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.220
My answer is both yes and no.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.470
Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.480
so long as it uses <i>Nen</i>, you can learn it.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.450
However,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.220
<i>Nen</i> powers depend on the
particular individual.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.800
Each of us possesses different
specialties and preferences.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.860
Thus, <i>Nen</i> differs for each person.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.940
If you're serious about mastering <i>Nen</i>,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.880
you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.000
It's important that you first identify
your own strengths.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.300
Strengths...

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.610
You've only just begun to develop.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.510
You haven't settled on one form yet.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.560
Initially, try to grow as much as you can.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.640
That is the purpose of this training.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.010
Train hard,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.180
play hard, and enjoy life.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.370
Osu!

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.870
The final day of Killua-kun's
window to fight is June 9th,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.650
and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.910
I'd like you both to register for your final day.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.530
In the meantime, you'll train.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.540
You must learn <i>Gyo</i>
before it's time for your battle.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.050
Osu!

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.890
Your <i>Ren</i> was impressive, Zushi.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.550
You moved way ahead while I was resting.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.280
No, I still have a long path before me.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.680
Hey, let's practice what we just learned.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.120
Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.930
Okay.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.440
Killua... Zushi.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.690
Osu!

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.950
We have company.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.390
You guys don't know when to quit.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.590
That's why no one likes you.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.910
Oh, don't be so harsh.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.250
Tell me when you're going to fight,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.350
because I'd love to be your opponent.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.110
I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.470
They want to rack up wins
by beating us up.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.190
We're getting desperate...

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.580
Because our deadline is nearing.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.110
Come on, let's fight.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.520
I'll even demonstrate my power

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.720
right now.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.910
I'm fighting on June 10th.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.130
Hey, Gon!

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.060
That won't work.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.630
My deadline is May 29th.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.640
Fight on that day.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.390
Who cares about your deadline, moron?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.500
Let's go.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.640
Gon-chan...

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.280
You and I will fight.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.900
I guarantee it.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.440
Gon, ignore him.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.920
What will you do?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.690
I'll force him to fight me.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.500
Visualize the energy building in your body.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:38.720
Power gathers in each cell, and grows.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.760
Then you force that power

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.510
out!

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.550
I'm getting used to this.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.030
Learning when to shroud the
boosted aura with <i>Ten</i>

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.550
was a little tricky.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.030
A-A little?

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.280
They pick it up too fast!

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.290
But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.820
Guess we should practice more.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.250
N-No, that's enough!

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.450
Learning when to rest is part of training.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.560
Let's call it a day.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.920
Really? I can still—

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.420
No!

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.650
If they pass me in half a day,
I'll lose all my motivation...

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.120
Oh...

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.330
Well, it's okay.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.810
We'll practice more tomorrow.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.430
Yeah.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.390
See you tomorrow.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.490
Bye.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.700
Okay, then...

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.980
I can't...

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.980
I can't move!

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.880
I can't talk or breathe...

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.000
What's going on?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.240
Oops.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.040
Please...

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.930
Forget it.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.830
I figured you were up to something.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.900
But you don't need dirty tricks
to make me fight you.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.920
When do you want to fight?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.680
Don't worry.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.550
I'll let you win.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.030
I'll even give you each a win.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.280
Is that good enough?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.240
After I get my win off you,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.790
I'm going to fight Gon-chan.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.640
If you want to fight Gon,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.960
you'll have to follow his schedule.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.790
He'll be more than happy to fight you.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.760
I can promise you that.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.630
Okay.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.080
If you two are willing to fight,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.400
we don't need to bother with this.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.560
Let's go register together.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.570
Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.240
Yeah, yeah. Sure...

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.270
But only this once.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.950
May 29th...

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.830
Okay, happy now?

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.960
Yes,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.020
we'll return him.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.670
Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.640
If you break your promise...

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.050
Eh... Whatever.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.370
Forget it.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.540
What? You got me curious.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.900
What will happen if we break our promise?

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.470
No point in telling you now.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.150
Just keep your word.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.660
Hello? Is this Gon-kun?

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.300
I'm sure you'll understand what this means.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.090
As long as you don't tell anyone,
and you follow my instructions,

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.350
the three of you will be able to
train as usual tomorrow.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.990
Zushi...

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.740
How did it go with Gon-chan?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.050
Perfect.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.290
He's registered for the 30th.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.920
That's two wins.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.370
Too easy.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.880
Not killing people is pretty hard.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.530
Clean living's tough...

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.770
Come on down! We have tickets!

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.770
These are fresh off the press...

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.380
Gon versus Sadaso!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.030
And here's Killua versus Sadaso...

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.050
If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.040
Pops.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.910
Yep?

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.190
Does Sadaso have only one arm?

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.170
Yeah, the one-armed fighter,
with the mask-like face.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.000
If he catches you with his
invisible left arm, you're finished.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.920
They call him the newbie crusher...

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.380
That bastard.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.430
Huh? Killua?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.310
Gon, you were here?

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.690
Y-Yeah...

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.740
Killua-kun,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.210
I believe you helped Zushi last night.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.190
Thank you.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.140
You feeling all right?

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.920
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.190
I was probably tired.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.210
Sorry to worry you!

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.520
Oh, Wing-san...

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.450
Can we watch that video again?

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.210
I've learned how to use <i>Gyo</i>.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.210
Really?

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.140
Fifteen threads, right?

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.500
Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.600
and a well hidden one that
leads to the arm he tossed.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.490
Continue.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.220
Hisoka is...

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.610
Hisoka's aura appears

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.990
to expand and contract.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.870
Or does it

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.760
attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.080
Why else would his arm reattach?

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.250
Or fly into his opponent's chin?

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.930
It's probably the former.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.640
His aura is elastic, like rubber.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.390
That would explain most of his tricks.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.900
He's on a completely different level!

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.600
Very good... You pass.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.490
But I am surprised...

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.130
I didn't expect you both to learn <i>Gyo</i> overnight.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.260
Gon?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.830
Uh-huh,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.260
but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.620
So, Killua-kun,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.010
since you finished your assignment,
I assume you want to fight, yes?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.190
O-Oh, I wasn't trying to
beat you to the punch.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.180
I just got an itch to fight.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.310
Yeah, I get it.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.560
Gon, they must have threatened you.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.440
Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.610
May 29th.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.590
Mine's May 30th.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.710
That's fine.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.410
I underestimated how fast you could learn.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.370
Spend the remaining days practicing <i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.420
Be sure you get plenty
of practice, rest, and sleep.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.860
Osu!

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.940
Killua...

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.760
They must have threatened you.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.660
Now I'm mad...

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.150
Yeah, but my biggest concern

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.720
was the master, and he agreed.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.860
But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.110
It'll be okay.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.490
You don't need to worry.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.050
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.870
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.870
Then I just need to find three more chumps.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.530
And I'll be a Floor Master.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.510
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.060
Move, and I will kill you...

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.740
Use <i>Nen</i>, and I will kill you.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.760
Make a sound, and I will kill you.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.620
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.820
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.020
If you know, slowly open your eyes.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.560
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.990
Never show your filthy face to us again.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.430
That's a promise.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.930
Time has run out for Sadaso!

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.390
Killua wins by default!

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.970
Damn, I want my money back!

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.400
Killua opens the battle
against the persistent trio

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.150
with a win by default.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.220
Thanks to their inborn talent,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.140
Gon and Killua are learning <i>Nen</i>
at incredible speeds.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.350
Now they will start the real battle

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.580
at Heavens Arena.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:15.330
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.700
Today, we introduce Sadaso.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.580
A Heavens Arena
200s-class warrior.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.080
He underwent the traditional greeting

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.050
with Gido and Riehlvelt.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.620
Alters his <i>Nen</i> to form
an invisible left arm.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.740
Yeah?

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.070
His invisible left arm is made of <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.780
Yeah?

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.270
Oh.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.870
Yeah?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.720
Next time: Power x To x Avenge!

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.910
Power, yeah?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.840
Avenge, yeah?

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.770
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
