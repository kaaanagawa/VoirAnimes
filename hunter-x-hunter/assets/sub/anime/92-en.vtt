WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.150
I never knew

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.260
how frustrating

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.980
weakness could be!

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.570
Gon...

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.130
<i>For the thirty days that you can't use</i> Nen...

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.480
I'll protect you.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.290
I will do whatever it takes!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
One Wish x And x Two Promises

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.700
Colt arrived, under a white flag of
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.470
His wish was that they save the dying Queen.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.150
After hearing his request, Morel and
Knov took Colt to see Netero.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.930
It's me.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.420
Send over a team of Chimera Ant
researchers immediately.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.760
Hmm?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.660
The king has been born.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.710
Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.320
and have him bring all

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.260
his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.200
We leave in four hours.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.130
Yes, sir.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.490
We will do everything we can.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.370
Colt-kun...

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.320
We'll need your cooperation.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.080
Heart

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.770
This may be the last time I wear this...

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.250
Hey, is that...

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.340
Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.510
Heart

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.980
They say it's a lucky shirt he only
wears when he fights for real.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.180
But I always thought it was a just a rumor...

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.240
Colt-kun, it appears that you can use <i>Nen</i>...

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.010
Since you've been in the King's presence,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.950
I want you to give me your honest opinion.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.830
How do I compare to the King?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.430
He really is special...

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.860
It feels like needles pricking
me all over my body.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.900
Most likely,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.010
you will be unable to lay a finger on him.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.130
You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.820
before you can get close enough.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.870
I see...

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.520
I'm happy to hear that.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.000
At this age, I'll be a challenger.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.580
This is exciting stuff.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.350
Morel, I believe your disciples
were to fight today, yes?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.720
Yes.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.100
Take the victors and the research team,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.800
along with Colt, to the nest.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.220
And you, Chairman?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.460
You don't plan to pursue the King alone?

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.550
Oh, no...

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.290
I'm off to see an old acquaintance.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.570
Don't forget to pay me my one million.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.630
I know.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.800
What are you talking about?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.110
Nothing important.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.660
Let's go.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.680
Yeah.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.590
Everyone else has left.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.720
Most of our soldiers joined
other squadrons and left.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.600
Though a few oddballs did leave
their squadrons to stay here.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.140
I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.070
Did you stop the bleeding?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.360
Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.620
I'm not sure we can, either.
Don't expect too much.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.870
For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.470
Can you use my organs?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.630
You can have all my blood, as well!

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.920
Unfortunately, it won't work.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.630
Chimera Ants from different generations
are completely different organisms.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.640
Just look at how much the Chimera
Ants in your own generation vary.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.140
But the sentiment is appreciated.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.400
We'll do our best, so pray...

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.060
That, miraculously, all the organs will function.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.200
Pray...

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.040
Is that all I can do?

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.440
Someone...

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.060
Is anyone there?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060
Yes, I am by your side!

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.070
Please give me your command!

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.020
What is it?

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.690
Telepathy?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.580
Yes,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.430
the Queen cannot speak as we do.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.840
Can you tell us what she's saying?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.590
Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.620
My son...

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.090
Is my son all right?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.400
Did he have any defects?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.780
...defects?

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.670
You have nothing to worry about.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.610
He is perfectly healthy, and right now...

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.530
And right now, he's taken
the Royal Guard to search

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.810
for medicine to help you.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.510
...to help you.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.390
The truth is that, after he killed
and ate Squadron Leaders,

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.130
he left in search of a new territory.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.730
I doubt he will return.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.050
He ate them?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.880
The King

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.000
has no concern for the Queen's health!

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.680
Then, the King is safe?

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.400
Yes.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.950
That is wonderful...

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.650
Oh, no.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.340
Send the King off at once.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.870
There is no time to waste on my well-being...

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:49.170
My son has the potential to rule the world.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.810
He was born too early,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.460
so I was very worried.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.900
However, it appears...

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.040
I have fulfilled my duty...

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.530
That was all I wanted.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.160
What are you saying?!

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.590
You are our guiding light...

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.990
Without you, the rest of us will
lose our way and perish.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.740
I know my body better than anyone else...

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.020
I will not last much longer.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.540
However, I have

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.760
no regrets.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.190
Please stop!

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.200
I beg you... Please live!

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.120
Use my body! Please!

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.590
Give it a shot!

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.700
Until you try, you don't know it won't work!

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.810
Listen...

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.710
You must listen to what the Queen has to say.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:16.570
I have one last request...

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.410
I thought of a name...

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.980
for my son.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.200
For the King...

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.550
A name?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.930
Meruem.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.930
It means the light that illuminates all.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.840
Deliver my message to him...

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.180
My beloved son...

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.380
I failed to protect her again...

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.360
I can't protect anyone...

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.480
Has something like this happened before?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.350
No, he's probably referring to a memory

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.810
from when he was human.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.160
You have memories from
when you were human?

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.310
Of course, though naturally, some
remember more than others...

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.670
Our human personalities

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.160
strongly influence our current behavior.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.070
And many can remember their human names.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.510
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been
as easy to learn to speak.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.990
Hmm?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.850
Th-This is...

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.020
There's...

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.180
There's something moving!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.470
Don't touch it!

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.180
I will...

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.260
I will remove it.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.980
I shall protect this child...

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.430
I swear it!

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.470
This time, I won't fail...

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.720
Morel?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.020
Colt...

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.330
Can you promise me

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.260
that you and that child
will never eat humans?

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.650
If you can't make that promise,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.950
you should get out of my sight immediately.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.850
But if you're willing to give your word...

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:37.330
No one will ever lay a finger on you,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.110
not as long as I'm around.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.500
You have my promise!

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.620
It isn't a big deal...

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:58.140
I inherited my soft nature from my master.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.310
Okay, I've recovered!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.250
Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.570
So I have to become stronger!

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.820
So that Kite won't be disappointed
when he comes back.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.330
Ah, so you do understand.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.010
You may have met Kite before we did,

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.560
but we've spent more time with him.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.340
After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still
been moping, I would've given you a beating...

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.820
And told you that Kite wouldn't
want to see you two like this.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.240
I know he's still alive,

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.860
and he doesn't want you to have regrets.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.000
Right now, what should you do?

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.520
You must make the correct decision,
and find the will to follow through!

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.850
If you're too weak, train more.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.120
There's enough space here
for squats and push-ups.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.070
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.020
Hey, Spin...

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.380
Hmm?

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.430
Why do you want to be a Hunter?

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.260
I need the money to repay a huge debt.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.340
Have you heard of the small-billed swan?

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.270
Nope...

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.550
It's a species of bird that can only live
in the area around a certain mine.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.420
No one knows why that is.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.280
Is it the water? The food? The weather?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.090
So I bought the entire area where the mine is.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.690
Well, the mine's closed down now.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.870
Kite provided the money for that.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.570
He was the first adult who was willing to listen

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.920
to kids who had nothing at all.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.620
Stinn and I were born in that area.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.720
The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking
flight with the light of dawn at their backs...

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:28.990
That's the oldest, but strongest,
memory Stinn and I have.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.520
When we heard the area would be demolished,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.060
we realized how important it was to us...

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.850
Kite said that he envied us.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.140
He doesn't have a home.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.860
Because he doesn't know where he was born.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.370
Once this mission is over,
I can show you two

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.470
my treasure.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.760
Th-This is...

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.240
Goal!

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.540
I am the Speed King.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.250
No one can stop me!

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.490
Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably
already crossed the border.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.800
Well, I'll take my time searching...

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.560
For my own paradise,
with plenty of food and females.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.260
Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.000
I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.770
Because I am the Glutton King.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.390
The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.760
have now departed to become kings.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.230
Meanwhile, the King

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.140
is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.830
Next time: Date x With x Palm.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.070
A date! A date!

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.370
Gon, do you understand what a date is?

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.400
Huh? Sure.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.960
It's when a man and woman—

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.450
Th-Th-That's enough!
