WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.490
When she's fixing,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.550
she must touch the target,
or her power won't work.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.330
I will save both Gon and Alluka!

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.040
Join Battle x And x Open Battle

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.680
Impossible...

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.090
There's no way I can remove this!

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.530
My power is not enough

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.970
to bear this burden.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.840
Killua?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.980
Where are you now? Are you okay?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.690
Yeah, I'm on my way back.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.980
How'd it go with Gon?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.240
No luck.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100
When we told him about Kite,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.610
there was no response on the monitors.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.280
A lot of people have dropped by to talk to him.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.300
But there's been no reaction.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.250
Right, I understand.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.840
I doubt we can heal him with normal measures.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160
Wait! Don't be too hasty, Killua.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.980
As you said, Gon used a restriction
and covenant to temporarily

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.760
wield an immense amount of <i>Nen</i>, right?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.140
Then it's best if we let a
<i>Nen</i> exorcist take care of it.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.620
We can wait until we've exhausted all our
options to resort to riskier measures.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.840
Oh, sorry. That didn't come out right.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.530
I'm not talking about taking a crazy gamble.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.760
In fact, I can guarantee Gon will be healed.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.580
Let me take care of this.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.540
This method isn't as risky as using a <i>Nen</i> exorcist.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.980
But the problem is how I can get there.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.550
This time, that will be the biggest challenge.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.730
Wh-What do you—

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.100
Forgive me, Master Killua.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.060
Is that you, Gotoh?

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.560
I can't let you continue that conversation,
on the grounds of secrecy.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.030
I didn't tell him anything secret!

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.480
Not true.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.730
You said you could guarantee Gon would be healed.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.240
That was a reference to Master Alluka's power.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.760
At the moment, you are still
just within Zoldyck property,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.540
but outside the boundaries, you are already
at alert level 4, so please be careful.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.280
So he was waiting for me to give Morel a hint?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.420
You're too easy on me, Gotoh.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.060
I do not understand what you mean.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.580
Level 4...

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.690
Looks like I pissed off my father.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.110
When one's outside alert level is 4,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.400
restrictions are placed upon
what the target can do and say.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.120
To enforce this restriction,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.700
multiple butlers and family members
are assigned to monitor the target.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.720
<c.coloreefc53>Restricted</c>

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.620
If a restriction is violated,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580
the target will immediately be
captured and returned home,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.600
<c.colordb1d32>Restricted</c>

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.080
and the alert will automatically increase to level 5.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.250
At level 5,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.910
the moment a single step is
taken outside Zoldyck property,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.510
the target is captured.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.620
What's the reason?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.410
The reasons are unauthorized
removal of a classified object,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.300
rebelling against your parents,
and use of threatening actions.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.680
Alluka's an object?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.360
There are three restrictions.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.560
First, to protect family secrets,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.800
the target may not speak to,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.370
or exchange items with,
any outsiders without permission.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.550
To enforce this, the target is forbidden
to carry any communication devices.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.470
I've already had everything taken away.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.620
Second, to protect family secrets,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.610
the target must stay within one meter
of Master Alluka at all times.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.150
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.760
I don't plan on letting her out of my sight.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.150
Third, to protect family secrets,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.780
you are forbidden from letting any outsiders

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.400
learn anything about Alluka's power.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.780
I understand perfectly.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.650
So basically...

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.160
This is what I have to do.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.530
This way, I don't have to ask permission
every time I do something.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.460
While we're traveling, I'll let you
handle all the arrangements!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.510
I understand why I am here.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.920
But why is Canary here?

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.250
Moron!

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.300
Alluka's a girl.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.560
I can't trust a lump like you to take care of her!

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.060
There is nothing to worry about.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.820
We shall also accompany you.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.130
Master Silva did not believe

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.320
that two butlers would be enough.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.020
Tsubone!

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.340
Dad really is pissed...

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.590
It's fine.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.530
I won't do anything stupid at alert level 4.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.000
Listen to me, Killua-chan.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.230
I'm not as lenient as your father and Gotoh.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.660
A single violation, and I'll take you home.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.440
Nothing will change that.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.280
If you resist, I'll knock you out.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.530
Keep that in mind.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.220
Are we clear?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.500
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.880
Tsubone-sensei is the only person

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.060
in the entire household who
calls Master Killua "Killua-chan."

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.760
No bullying Brother.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.490
I'm sorry...

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.500
Alluka-chama is so kind.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.270
I won't do it again.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.530
I just realized something.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.770
I have trouble dealing with old ladies.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.200
Do you love your big brother?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.780
I love him lots!

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.700
Then you should do as he says.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.540
Okay!

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.380
Master Killua is depending on me.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.760
All so he can save his friend,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.190
regardless of the risks.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.830
I will help him!

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.290
Even if it costs me this job

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.290
or my life.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.400
I am Amane. It's a pleasure.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.410
Canary.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.960
The pleasure's mine.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.810
Tsubone!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.610
Give me the nail of your pinky.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.710
She made a request of Tsubone!

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.010
This is the worst time for it!

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.770
Even I don't know when, and of whom,
Something's requests will come.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.100
Yes, absolutely.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.880
Master Killua,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.870
I will go into hiding for the time being.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.930
This means that Master Alluka

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.630
will not make requests of anyone else.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.480
Unless I change my mind.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.730
Do you understand what I mean?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.320
Of course, I will remain near you at all times.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.640
I still have more requests...

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.900
She pulled a fast one!

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.900
It's all right.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.270
I still have a chance.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.920
I won't be able to make a wish,
but I can issue a command!

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.040
Brother, are you angry?

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.800
It's okay.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.300
There's nothing for you to worry about.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.350
I will save you!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.610
Yes?

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.010
Yes.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.990
Yes.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.970
That's right.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.140
This is Master Killua's phone.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.740
No, I cannot answer that question.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.490
I cannot answer that question, either.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.120
In that case,

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.960
you should state your name first.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.710
Goodbye.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.870
Who was that?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.920
It was...

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.640
Hello?

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.150
My name is Leorio!

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.840
Can you put Killua-kun on the phone?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.910
Shh!

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.660
Wow, that brings back memories!

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.440
It has been quite some time, Master Leorio.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.680
Huh?

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.830
Oh! I remember!

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.060
It's the coin guy!

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:17.120
Master Killua is currently on his way
there, accompanied by us.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.310
Yes, to help Master Gon.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.140
However, there are strict conditions
that must be met.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.430
Hey, there...

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.780
Conditions to save a friend?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.190
Are you dreaming?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.060
If you need help waking up,
I'll speak more loudly!

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.760
Keep your mouth shut.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.490
What did you say?

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.490
Master Killua is risking his life.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.180
He's heading to you, against his family's wishes.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.120
You should know that the Zoldyck
family is very special.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.160
We are the ones who set the conditions.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.810
So shut up and listen, fool.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.130
Gotoh...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.260
Please excuse me.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.990
Let me talk to him.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.320
It'll be faster that way.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.890
Don't worry.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.830
I won't say anything I'm not supposed to.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.620
One violation, and I'll be sent home, right?

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.250
Yo, it's been a while.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.650
Killua!

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.950
When you get here, let me talk to that guy.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.450
Are you okay?

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.730
Yeah, but I can't say anything specific.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.790
I need you to trust me.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.040
Do as Gotoh says.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.600
Yeah, got it.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.790
Put him back on.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.800
I'll ask about the conditions.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.370
Let me talk.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.230
Uh... Morel-san, was it?

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.200
This is my phone, and I'm talking to my buddy,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.120
so why should I let you talk?

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.890
An excellent question.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.050
The answer is to give me the phone.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.320
No way. Get lost.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.880
Very well.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.450
Then, I have a favor to ask.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.580
My guess is that you'll say, "That isn't possible."

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.080
In which case, you should hand over the phone.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.660
Because I can make it possible.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.960
Hello?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.620
No, it's nothing.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.470
Tell me the conditions.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.470
When we arrive,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.980
there must be no one inside
the building except Master Gon.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.300
Not even doctors?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.390
Correct.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.970
Or any other patients?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.950
Correct.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.240
That isn't possible!

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.680
This is a national hospital!

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.230
Do you have any idea how
many people are in here?!

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.170
Hello?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.470
I understand the conditions.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.810
Leave it to me.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.560
What is the plan?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.050
This is a big hospital,

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.090
with a big parking lot.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.440
We'll set up a private room for Gon there.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.640
It'll be arranged so you can
drive in and out of the area.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.920
I'll make sure that no one can learn

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.110
what you do inside.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.390
Understood.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.040
That satisfies our requirements.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.530
What is your name?

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.510
I'm Morel.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.290
From now on, I'd like you to
be the one I speak with.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.790
There you go.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.790
Oh, I need to make another call.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.870
Knov?

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.630
It's me.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.040
The situation's changed.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.470
I need you to make sure the equipment
is operable in an outside room.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.860
No, no monitors.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.810
And we can't have any windows.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.100
True...

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.160
It sounds like they have a <i>Nen</i> exorcist,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.610
since they don't want anyone watching.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.820
But Killua made it sound like something else.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.780
The only <i>Nen </i>exorcist in the Hunter Association

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.330
said Gon was beyond help.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.580
But Killua said he could heal him with no risks.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.260
No, let's not pursue the matter.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.340
Killua said to let him take care of it.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:32.100
In the field, the rule is to listen when
a trusted friend tells you to.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.450
Morel, I'll let you handle all contact with Killua.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.670
Yeah, I've got it.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.330
What are you going to do?

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.610
There are several people

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.890
I need to have a word with.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.510
Gon's fighting for his life...

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.170
Where are you, and what are you doing?

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.560
Why won't you answer your phone,

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.890
Kurapika?

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.820
And so, the Zodiacs respect the
former chairman's wishes.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.340
And we've worked diligently to maintain

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.670
the status quo, and we seek
to better the Association.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:52.290
Your vote, no matter for whom
you vote, will not go to waste!

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.680
You can be assured of that.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.220
At the same time,

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.130
I'm sure that some people are dissatisfied

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.190
with the current state of the Association,
or want to shake up the leadership.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.800
However, I must ask

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.440
that you do not express that opinion
by refusing to cast a vote.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.950
You are more than welcome to make
a speech up here, on the spot.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.230
All you have to do is speak up.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.280
We will never seek to smother a minority opinion.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.150
We have Ging here,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.340
who commits countless violations every year,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.220
but still calls himself a member of the Zodiacs.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.230
If you intend to skip the vote,
you might as well vote for him.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.730
Ah, that was meant to be a joke.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.240
This was the final mission the
former chairman gave us.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.230
The entire Association should
work together to clear it!

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.260
Okay, thank you very much, Vice Chairman.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.740
Please return to your seat.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.420
Make it quick.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.660
We now open the floor to everyone here.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.260
If you'd like to express your views or
ask a question, raise your hand.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.020
Okay, the big guy in the dark suit... Go ahead.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.480
I'm Leorio, from the 287th class.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.970
I have a question for that guy named Ging.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.250
That's Gon's dad.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.760
Why haven't you gone to visit Gon?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.550
You must know his current condition!

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.980
Okay, let's hear the answer.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.060
First, what is your relationship to Gon?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.220
We're buddies.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.160
Oh... I appreciate it.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.660
I hope you'll stay friends with him.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.950
That's all.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.570
Answer my question!

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.320
Or just go visit him!

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.420
Go visit Gon!

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.580
I've heard he has a number of friends like you.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.180
That should suffice.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.090
Don't give me that bull!

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.840
Do you have any idea how much
Gon wants to see you?

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:43.350
If you talk to him, he might recover!

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.850
Did he say

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.100
that he wanted me to visit?

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.260
He couldn't say it if he wanted to...

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.080
You damned

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.740
bastard!

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.110
You can go to hell!

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.460
Wow!

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.590
You'll find footage of today's entire
meeting on the Hunter site,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.570
so tell everyone who wasn't present!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.180
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.470
The Zoldyck family has different plans for Alluka.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.840
And this man never changes.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.010
Next time: Magician x And x Butler.
