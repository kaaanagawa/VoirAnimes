WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
Hey, Youpi!

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.150
I'm over here, fool!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.310
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.250
That's fine.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.500
That will serve to distract Youpi,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.990
and it will save Shoot.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.050
Duty x And x Question

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.610
"Hagya-sama."

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.830
Ikalgo didn't realize that the name
he had spoken with full confidence

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.160
had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.200
as he headed beneath the palace

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.670
to search for Palm.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.560
Satellite Dragonflies!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.610
Ikalgo knew Palm only through the
information he had been given.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.670
However, he was already firm in his resolve

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.610
that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.870
I'm gonna rescue her.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.120
Palm is a friend of a friend.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.870
That makes her a friend...

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.620
My friend!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.060
Palm was risking her life.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.430
That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.340
I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.000
I want to help her...

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.650
Because I decided I would help her!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.660
The elevator leading underground

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.920
was equipped with a security camera and a scale.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.920
After arriving underground,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.670
it would confirm that there was nothing inside

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.710
before automatically returning to the surface.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.320
Any number of people could descend at once,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.180
but only one could ascend at a time.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.060
And a pass code had to be entered.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.830
The eight-digit code varied per person,
and could be used to identify

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.190
who had used the elevator.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.680
If the user's height and weight
do not match the data

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.390
on record from the time the code
was assigned, a warning sounded,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.150
and the elevator became a prison.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.200
On the first entry of an incorrect code,
a warning sounded, and the doors locked.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.060
Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.690
the elevator filled with sleeping gas,
and the violator was captured and tortured.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.700
In other words, a third error meant death.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.710
Both the violator and the code's
original owner would be killed,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.000
making one's code as valuable as one's own life.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.170
And the only code holders

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.630
able to use the elevator without
any such restriction

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.870
were Bizeff and Marcos.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.290
That was because the elevator
was a more convenient means

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.530
of smuggling in various things, including humans,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.880
than the cargo entrance,
which was watched by soldiers.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.700
What is this smell?!

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.280
Has Flutter been living in the morgue?

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.670
I can also smell Bro, since he was

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.050
the last one in here before me.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.290
Damn, there's something else, very faint...

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.360
The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.580
to dull Welfin's sense of smell.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.180
Since Bro followed Flutter underground,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.080
he must have also noticed that Flutter
used the name "Hagya-sama."

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.490
Or is Brovada conspiring with him?

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.760
When I was watching the intruder,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.000
was Bro watching me from behind?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.930
If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.380
then he must have seen that
I noticed Flutter's odd behavior...

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.360
So, he went down first...

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.030
In order to ambush me!

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.390
Damn, this is my chance!

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.760
Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.310
If I can pass him off him as the
bomb threat's perpetrator,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.250
Bizeff will be indebted to me!

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.250
Bizeff!

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.100
Where's Bizeff?

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.670
This is bad...

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.860
If he dies during the attack,
my plans will be ruined!

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.870
Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.560
Yo.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.710
Grandpa...

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.770
He's changed.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.960
My job here is done.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.290
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.930
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.280
Inside?

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.420
Swallowing the words he wanted to say,

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.680
Zeno disappeared into the darkness.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.000
Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:50.890
Knuckle has revealed himself, a move
that was not part of the original plan.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.510
Meleoron and Shoot

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.370
could only hold their breaths.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.230
Bring it!

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.620
Bring it!

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.130
I see... Then this is yours.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.780
It's time.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.930
Adding interest.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.500
The number increased?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.650
My attacks won't work?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.790
What is this thing?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.340
Don't you run!

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.550
Answer me!

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.530
What is this thing?!

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.610
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.580
If you wanna know, catch me first!

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.580
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.960
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.790
In that case, I'll walk at a pace
that's neither fast nor slow,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.100
to conserve as much oxygen as possible!

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.610
I must not lose consciousness...

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.010
If I pass out,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.010
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:48.970
Every little bit of damage counts...

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.910
I can still fight...

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.520
I can still...

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.410
I can't... I just can't say it!

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.820
I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.330
Right now, my job...

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.300
isn't to help Shoot!

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.120
It's to use my power to help the others,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.090
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.980
You have to survive, Shoot!

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.400
Don't die!

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.550
No one's here.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.520
Stay calm...

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.720
Look around carefully.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.640
If I'm caught, I can still pretend
to be on their side.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.200
However...

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.860
That might not work, depending on who I run into.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.220
Perfect Plan... Undo!

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.410
Okay!

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.830
Activate!

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.960
That's Morel's Smoky Jail.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.270
Which means...

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.300
Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne
room, with no possibility of interruption!

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.280
That only leaves...

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.850
Gon and Killua!

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.780
Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.030
Which way did they go?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.180
Welfin?!

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.330
Crap!

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.660
He's tough to deal with...

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.620
He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.590
Once he suspects you, he won't
trust you again until you're dead!

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.020
I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.020
Which way do I go?

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.890
What if he goes the same way?

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.570
Do I wait for him to leave?

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.420
Can I hold my breath that much longer?

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.080
No... I can't hold it!

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.800
I'm at my limit!

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:58.170
I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.960
Perfect Plan, undo!

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.580
Now inhale...

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.960
Activate!

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.790
For a second, I sensed something.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.460
The enemy?

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.850
Welfin's power reflected his very nature,

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.300
channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.520
Egg Man
Missile Man

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.900
Missile Man!

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.960
If anyone's hiding behind the building,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.790
surrender and show yourself by
the time I count down from three!

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.560
If you don't, I'll attack!

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.590
Three!

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.070
Two!

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.530
One!

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.340
Fire!

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.110
No one's there... Did I imagine it?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.150
To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.160
and loads ammo in the form
of questions or commands.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.830
If someone answers falsely or disobeys,
the attack is launched.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.840
By the time Welfin noticed a presence,
Meleoron had already moved.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.640
Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.900
his attack would have succeeded,
despite his inability to detect his target.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.200
Finding nothing fitting the target's
description, the attack failed.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:09.360
Once fired, Missile Man will
pursue its target until it hits.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.500
No one can survive the impact.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:20.160
However, Welfin understood that
his ability wasn't omnipotent.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.640
His power was nothing more than a tool.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.990
Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.800
He sought to become the king behind the scenes,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.180
because being the real king would mean
he'd have too much to be suspicious of.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.560
It was my imagination?

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.560
No, wait...

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.780
I smell odorless deodorant...

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.200
You can't fool my nose.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.310
Someone was here! I know it!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.830
Since I could only sense them for a moment,
they must be very skilled.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.730
The use of deodorant confirms
that they're aware of my nose.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.470
This confirms that there are traitors among us!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.900
There are others besides Flutter?

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.100
The answer is probably yes!

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.970
And it's someone I know...

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.890
That's why they're hiding their scent.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.400
Who is it?

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.160
They don't want to fight me?

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.740
Because they can take me out at any time?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.570
Do I...

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.570
Do I...

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.280
Do I really

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.020
want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.660
Should I really be

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.620
searching for Bizeff now?

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:22.490
As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives...

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.530
Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.010
their target for avenging Kite.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.230
Next time: Revenge x And x Recovery.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.120
Meleoron!
