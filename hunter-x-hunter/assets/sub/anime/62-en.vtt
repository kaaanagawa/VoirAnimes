WEBVTT

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.730
Championship Finals, round 7!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.820
Ready...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.510
Go!

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.790
First comes rock...

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.740
Rock... Paper...

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.450
Scissors!

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.620
Killua wins!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.820
Yes!

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.210
Congratulations.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.840
Here is your prize, the Sword of Truth.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.760
Look, Gon...

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.260
Sword of Truth
Sword that cuts through
anything false. Has been
used in trials to determine
criminals. Breaks if used
to cut something true,
but will regenerate if left
in scabbard for a day.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.320
This is card #83.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.860
It goes in a restricted slot.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.640
Okay, that's one down.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.020
Score!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.020
Reality x And x Raw

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.060
The problem

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.780
is how we protect the card.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.050
We don't have any defensive spell cards.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.030
Wait, kids!

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.530
H-Hand over the Sword of Truth!

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.410
Do as I say,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.290
and I won't be rough with you.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.330
No way, stupid.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.300
W-Wait!

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.250
Book!

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.070
Book!

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.030
Hmph, you're bluffing.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.810
I know that you just started this game.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.530
You have no defensive spells,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.080
and all you would have in your restricted slots

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.500
is the Sword of Truth.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.690
This is Thief!

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.200
Thief
Steal one random card
from a restricted slot
of one target player.
[SR][ATK]

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.920
This spell card lets you steal

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.200
one random card from
another player's restricted slots!

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.700
Take this...

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.800
Thief on!

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.180
Attack Killua!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.830
Haven't you been training at all,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.940
Mister?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.340
Next time, I won't return your card.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.340
You must be an amateur.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.840
I'm impressed you got into a game for Hunters.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.590
But that was very educational.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.110
An attack spell won't kick in
until you finish the chant.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.740
Th-That only works against weak players!

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.980
Precisely.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.360
If you want a card,
you take it from someone.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.440
Only fools would participate in tournaments.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.560
Understand, boys?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.660
I'm so pissed!

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.810
Just forget it.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.650
Those guys were obviously pros.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.320
At least we didn't waste too much effort.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.910
Damn it!

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.640
Then I'm gonna start getting spell cards!

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.640
That means our next destination
will be Masadora, City of Magic.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.460
No objections!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.330
That's our base.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.810
We'll begin assigning roles.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.970
You will collect spell cards for us.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.020
You've probably heard that there
are forty different spell cards.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.180
We need you to obtain
one of those cards, Prison.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:58.070
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed from
their slot. (Can only
target pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.210
This is one of the strongest defensive spells.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.230
We could certainly use another one of these.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.320
In order to protect Breath of Archangel.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.620
Breath of Archangel?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.170
A super-rare SS card that no one's

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.590
ever been able to obtain.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.080
How can you be certain no
one's gotten one before?

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.090
List
Reveal number of card
holders and number of
cards for a target item.
[LR][NORM]

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.110
There's a spell card called List.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.670
When you cast it,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.090
you can learn the maximum
transformation limit of any card

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.250
as well as the number of current card holders.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.610
I see.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.500
The card is very difficult to obtain

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.710
because you must have all forty spell
cards before you can trade for one.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.140
But spell cards are extremely
useful in this game,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420
so players tend to use them up.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.120
However, we've been able

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.490
to collect all forty spell cards.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.000
We would prefer to trade them in for
a Breath of Archangel at once...

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.280
But then you'd have no cards to protect it.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.260
That's why you need a copy of Prison.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.740
Exactly.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.640
At any rate, to carry out this plan,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.300
we'll need you all to memorize
the forty different spell cards.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.150
Those four Galgaida cards
netted us 120,000 Jenny.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.850
They were pretty valuable.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.820
We don't need to worry about money now.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.150
Let's buy some food and water,
so we can start for Masadora!

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.160
First, we'll need a map.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.910
Map of Island
A detailed map
showing cities
and important
locations, as well
as useful information
such as hot spots!

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.910
Map of Island
A blank map that
automatically fills in
locations as the owner
visits and gathers
information about them.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.750
The one with information costs 650,000,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.910
while the blank one is 20,000.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.690
Which one should we get?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.790
The 20,000 one.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.990
It'll be more fun to fill it in ourselves.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.280
You're so positive, it's painful.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.970
Gain.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.430
This doesn't tell us anything.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.060
Then let's ask.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.940
Head north for eighty kilometers.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.550
After you pass the mountain,
you'll reach a lake.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.620
If you follow the lake north,
you should reach Masadora.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.430
If we hurry, we can go
eighty kilometers in a day.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.280
Yep.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.310
Assuming you survive.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.660
The mountain is crawling with bandits.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.960
And once you pass the mountain,
you'll encounter hordes of monsters.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.330
Bandits?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.460
Monsters?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.450
Now it sounds more like an RPG!

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.490
I wanna see these monsters!

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.520
Let's hurry up!

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.360
All right!

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.910
Off we go!

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.220
Please wait!

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.200
I beg you!

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.850
What?

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.270
Please let me join you!

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.170
Oh, sorry.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.730
Can't.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.230
Wh-Why not?

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.740
You'd be a nuisance.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.770
Little brat...

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.960
You dare call me a nuisance?

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.750
If I chose to, I could mop the floor with
you, with one hand behind my back.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.540
That does it.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.210
I was just going to tease these boys a little,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.170
but now I'm going to ruin their lives.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.240
Hey, hold it right there!

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.570
Please!

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.840
I'll try really hard not to get in your way!

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.900
Okay, I have most of the information we need.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.540
Then, can you tell us what you found?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.400
All right. I'll start with number one.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.210
I tried a hundred different people in this city,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.940
and they all gave the same response

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.230
when faced with an unusual question.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.950
This is typical behavior
for in-game characters.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.230
Number two.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.790
Book.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:48.920
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.620
This card is real.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.490
This one is a copy Kortopi made.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.310
Gain.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.430
Kortopi's card didn't transform.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.950
I believe that means the game's program

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.570
didn't recognize Kortopi's card.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.180
Number three.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.940
Shizuku's vacuum works in this world,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.570
but it won't work on any items
with special abilities.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.270
I think that's because the game was programmed

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.610
so <i>Nen</i> couldn't be used to collect cards.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.820
So?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.370
However, the above three points

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.330
indicate another possibility.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.020
This game isn't taking place
in a virtual world.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.080
It's based somewhere in the real world.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.840
What do you mean?

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.020
If the players actually entered the game,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.830
their spirits would detach from
their bodies and enter the console,

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.100
leaving the bodies behind.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.260
Sending them physically into the
game would be unnecessary.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.160
And separating spirit from
body should require more

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.980
than standing before a console and using <i>Hatsu</i>.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.120
It's more logical that the players
are actually warped elsewhere.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.240
Thus,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.780
<i>Greed Island</i> isn't a real game.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.280
It's a trap that sends players who
use <i>Hatsu</i> here, to this island.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.070
That makes sense.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.000
But what does it mean?

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.010
Do you remember the reward
for clearing this game?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.540
Let's see...

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.510
What was it?

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.370
You can select three item cards

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.270
from your restricted slots,
to take back to the real world.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.630
Right.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.230
That means these items can
be used outside the island.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.540
If this game takes place in the real world,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.620
it should be possible to remove

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.220
the treasure without clearing the game.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.140
I understand.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.560
Book.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.860
At the moment, we only
know about a few items.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.790
It would be ideal to learn all of the cards.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.710
So our first objective is
the spell card God Eye.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.300
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.900
Now we just need to find Phinks and Feitan.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.260
Another cheap map?

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.130
But he was carrying a lot of spell cards.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.590
Well, let's split up for now.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.070
In one week, we'll meet in Masadora.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.920
It's a contest to see who
can kill more players.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.870
Okay, be sure to take their cards first.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.710
Hey, what should we do about her?

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.140
Just ignore her.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.180
Once the bandits show up,
we'll have a chance to ditch her.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.140
Isn't that kind of mean?

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.980
What are you talking about?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.520
Tsezgerra let her pass,
so she must have strong <i>Nen</i>.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.530
She should be able to escape if it gets hairy.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.540
I didn't think she'd keep up this long.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.190
They have considerable physical strength.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.020
For a couple of kids, anyway.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.240
Let's take them.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.050
Yeah.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.340
Please help us!

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.520
We beg you!

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.580
Huh?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.180
A disease is going around the island.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.190
It starts with a mild fever,

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.140
grows to a high fever, and
eventually leads to death.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.450
All we can do is use medicine
to keep the fever in check.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.020
But the medicine will only work for a week.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.740
It's also incredibly expensive,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.080
and we've run out of money...

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.620
We've all fallen ill,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.590
so we're unable to do any bandit work.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.400
Is it contagious?

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.420
That's just a scenario.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.500
My son only has two or three days to live!

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.660
Could you spare us any money?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.510
This is an in-game event, right?

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.680
Yeah, if we give them money,

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.310
they should provide us with
items or information.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.630
Uh, how much do you need?

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.270
80,000 Jenny.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.430
That's all we have left.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.460
So they know everything about us.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.430
Um,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.320
I have enough to cover 80,000 Jenny.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.190
Ah, could you shut up for a moment?

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.570
I'm gonna kill that brat.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.020
Got it.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.360
We can give you 80,000 Jenny.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.900
Really?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.480
Thank you so much!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.580
You've saved my son's life!

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.000
I'm c-cold.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.150
So cold...

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.750
Oh, no!

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.680
If his body gets any colder,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.690
he'll die before we can
get him the medicine!

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.390
If only we had some children's clothes!

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.470
Some children's clothes!

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.560
Um, I can give him my clothes.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.350
That'd really be okay?

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.230
You're like angels!

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.060
Words are not enough...

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.110
...to express our gratitude!

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.850
Nah, we don't need thanks.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.930
How about some information or items?

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.000
We got nothing?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.000
We lost our clothes,
and now we're totally broke.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.620
Damn, they're mocking us!

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.260
What was that about?

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.720
But once we get past this mountain,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.830
we'll find lots of monsters, right?

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:09.820
Yeah.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.520
If we beat them and turn them into cards,
we can sell them for lots of cash.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.520
We finally get to start fighting!

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.520
Time to see what you've got.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.860
Ditto.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.150
I wanna see what you accomplished
during your secret training.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.150
This area is rocky...

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.130
Let's go!

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:36.910
Yeah!

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.160
There are tons of them!

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.270
Gon's punch did no damage?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.110
So no amount of punching will take one down.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.860
And there are so many.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.360
In order to disable it with a single attack...

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.360
Bingo! The eye is its weakness.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.780
Book.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.280
Gon, aim for the eye!

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.750
Got it!

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.950
They're moving around too much,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.640
but they're doing reasonably well.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.850
Weaker than they looked.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.110
The card reverted after we
left it alone for a minute.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.120
We can do this.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.120
The monsters come with weaknesses.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.010
If we stay calm and think, we'll be fine.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.190
Okay.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.000
Let's head for Masadora, then.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.630
Yeah!

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.030
Huh?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:31.720
Gon!

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.470
I'm okay!

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.030
That didn't hurt.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.970
This one's weak.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.670
But it's fast!

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.290
Let's catch it.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.300
Damn!

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.800
Watch the trajectory,
not its current location.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.270
With observation, you can learn an
opponent's pattern of motion.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.970
Your eyes are sharp, but you
aren't using them properly.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.310
It got away from us.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.200
Well, it won't take very
long to reach Masadora

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.820
if they're all this weak.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.820
Don't be stupid!

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.330
What if you encounter a monster
that's both strong and fast?

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.610
Bubbles?

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.230
It's gone...

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.480
It's loud and generates a shock wave,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.090
but it doesn't do any damage.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.350
When you touch them,

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.610
the red ones don't pop.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.230
The white bubbles pop

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.240
when they make contact with a human aura.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.470
The red ones pop when they make
contact with anything else.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.140
To catch that horse, you must
identify which bubble is which,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.090
<i>then switch between</i> Zetsu <i>and</i> Ten.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.320
That's still too difficult for them.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.530
Still...

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.880
These boys are...

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.880
These boys are just

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.890
wasting their potential!

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.190
They're raw stones that'll shine like
diamonds with a little polishing!

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.700
But at this rate, they'll run into
stronger players or monsters,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.350
and it'll be game over!

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.380
This one looks tougher.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.020
That's it...

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.510
I've had enough!

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.160
Gyo!

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.160
Keep your eyes on it!

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.190
Use <i>Gyo</i>!

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.340
Don't you know how?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.370
See that?

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.550
The armor's just a puppet,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.130
so attacks won't work against it.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.560
Here it is!

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.630
I got the card!

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.690
So you can use <i>Gyo</i>.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.880
Why didn't you use it before?

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.250
Uh, well...

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.320
Yeah...

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.830
So you forgot.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.820
Why are you just standing there?

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.600
Gyo!

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.470
What do you see?

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.900
The number 1.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.940
Good.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.970
Listen up.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.290
If I lift my finger, you use <i>Gyo</i>.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.970
And then you holler out what you see.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.500
If you ever sense anything suspicious, use <i>Gyo</i>.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.840
Got it?

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.230
Wait, why are you ordering us around?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.870
The number 5!

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.630
Correct.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.280
Drop and give me two hundred push-ups.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.460
Huh?

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.640
It's your punishment!

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.540
Get to it!

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.240
What the hell? Why should I?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.770
Got a problem?

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.990
You bet!

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.490
Who do you think you are?

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.710
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.980
I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.880
I first learned <i>Nen</i> forty years ago.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.360
I'm going to use my wealth of
knowledge and experience

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.780
to coach you boys.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.510
You should be grateful.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.980
Forty years ago?!

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.020
You're an old hag!

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.140
As it turns out, the young girl
following Gon and Killua

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.690
is a highly experienced pro Hunter.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.220
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.750
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.310
Today, we'll introduce the card God Eye.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:15.040
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.160
That's the card Shalnark wants.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.320
If you use this spell, you get
a description of a given card,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.840
number of holders, and total
number of cards in existence.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.040
I want one!

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.170
Next time: A x Hard x Master.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.590
My master is Wing-san!

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.310
My master is—

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.960
P-Pow!

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.430
Another bump on the head...
