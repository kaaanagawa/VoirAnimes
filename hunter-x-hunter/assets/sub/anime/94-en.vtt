WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
I have to defeat him,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.820
or it's all over!

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.990
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.990
Friend x And x Journey

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.790
Determined to protect Gon

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.430
for the thirty days he can't use <i>Nen</i>,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.020
Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.820
However...

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.730
Run.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.680
Yes! That's more like it!

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.520
That terrified expression...

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.360
I love it!

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.050
Damn, I'm getting excited now...

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.310
I'm gonna tear you apart.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.240
If you aren't certain you can win, run.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.690
I have to protect him... I have to...

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.320
When you know nothing of your opponent...

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.280
...protect Gon.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.550
...run away.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.780
No matter what!

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.240
Is there something special about that tree?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.430
Just wait a little longer.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.200
Amazing...

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.550
They're seaside fireflies.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.360
They're only found around brackish water,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.100
and this is their breeding season.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.880
It's beautiful!

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.770
Isn't it?

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.580
You piss yourself or something?

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.070
Well?!

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.330
Can't even move a muscle?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.980
Lose your spine?

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.190
Damn, this feels so good...

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.620
Should I kill him?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.710
Ah, but I want to enjoy this!

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.570
Here.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.320
It's a present.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.330
This is the most beautiful flower in the world.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.830
It is?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.080
Stay still.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.450
The tree's sap is very similar to
the pheromones fireflies emit,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.240
so they tend to gather around branches.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.550
I'm so happy...

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.370
Thank you.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.810
Really?

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.650
I'm glad to hear that.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.300
But I...

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.390
I can't give you what you truly want.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.800
What I truly want?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.020
Time alone with me.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.400
Eh?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.400
I...

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.410
I want to become stronger.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.380
Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.410
That means I have to train harder.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.230
In two days, Kite's coming back.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.590
But it sounds like he's under enemy control.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.220
To return him to normal, I'll probably
have to fight whoever is controlling him.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.480
So until Kite is back to normal...

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.400
Or if possible, until the
Chimera Ants are defeated...

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.890
I want to focus on my training.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.530
Yes... Yes!

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.410
Are you okay with that?

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.500
Huh?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.960
What was that?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.970
Damn! I can't get enough!

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.270
Run...

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.280
Hurry.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.830
No...

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.110
Gon!

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.370
I will...

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.620
...protect you.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.090
Because

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.980
we're friends...

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.890
You're my dear friend!

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.080
Stop that...

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.230
Don't look at me like that.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.300
I c-can't stop myself...

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.660
I'll kill you.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.280
I'll kill you! I'll kill you...

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.030
Run.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.360
Shut up!

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.290
Run.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.680
I won't listen to you!

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.800
Run... Run... Run...

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.530
Shut up!

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.160
I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.430
Run.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.470
I don't want

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.440
to lose him!

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.360
Run.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.660
Gon is...

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.450
Run.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.200
...my...

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.450
Run.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.530
...dear...

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.500
Run.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.790
It has to be Killua.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.010
My very dear friend!

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.590
He disappeared?

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.040
He fooled me good.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.760
Illumi must have planted this

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.760
inside my head.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.710
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.470
Have you lost your mind?

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.770
And how did you dodge that?

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.270
Wait, I saw the whole thing.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.850
Right before I reached him,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.700
he jammed his finger into his own head.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.620
And then he vanished,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.830
before popping up over there.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.440
Yeah, I feel so much better now.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.240
I'm completely awake now.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.040
Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.600
That's all that happened! Nothing more...

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.810
This can't be happening!

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.060
Now I'm the one who's afraid?!

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.960
I have a message for the other Ants.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.750
If you come anywhere near us,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.500
your lives are over.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.990
That's bull!

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.710
Very well.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.100
Then don't bother.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.520
They're gone.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.580
Their stuff's still here...

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.630
Were other Ants nearby?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.720
I don't sense any.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.140
That means...

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.910
What are you doing?!

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.150
Eh? Can't you tell?

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.150
I'm punishing him.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.420
Punishing him for toying with my feelings!

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.390
What the hell?

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.170
You're the one who's being unreasonable!

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.680
Well, at least he's okay...

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.080
Leave us alone!
This is none of your business!

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.590
Right back at you, stupid.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.380
Why don't you make yourself scarce?

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.200
Why are you injured?

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.280
Huh?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.200
Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.180
I'll injure you some more!

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.010
Palm...

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.670
Don't bother.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.340
I could dodge your knife in my sleep.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.170
I was so sure he was dead...

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.810
Wait!

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.530
I'll kill you!

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.120
What?

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.120
Catch us if you can, stupid!

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.260
Wait!

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.300
Stop, Killua...

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.550
You're just making her angrier.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.410
Huh?

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.090
If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.140
We just have to call Knuckle and tell
him we'll meet him somewhere else.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.390
I'm going back.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.330
Do you want to die?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.430
If you let your guard down,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.420
thinking she's not much of a fighter,
she'll stab you in the back!

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.780
She wouldn't do that.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.710
Huh?!

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:33.230
Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.470
Damn, you're too much!

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.060
They're making a fool of me!

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.840
They think they've escaped me?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.310
Fools!

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.350
Wherever you run to, I will know!

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.990
Cute, cute mermaid...

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.170
Where is that accursed brat, Killua?

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.890
There he is, the fool!

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.180
The hotel by the station...

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.090
Brat...

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.420
Brat! Brat! Brat!

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.680
He keeps interfering!

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.950
If not for him, everything would be fine.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.450
I'll chase him to the end of
the world and eliminate him!

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.060
Make a fool of me, will you?!

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.840
Kno—

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.150
Knov-sama...

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.590
Where did those boys go?

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.170
R-Right...

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.590
They went to the hotel that
has a logo with three circles.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.810
This is Knov.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.730
They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.760
Yeah, we just got a call from them.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.240
Um, I believe you had planned
to arrive in two days...

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.890
No, we're on schedule.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.990
We'll use the extra two days
to observe those boys,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.920
to determine if they're ready to
see Kite in his current state.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.580
But first things first, Palm!

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.650
Y-Yes?

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.440
It appears that you used your
power without my permission.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.760
I told you to await my orders,
in case of unforeseen events.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.380
Yes...

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.770
Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.560
Irreplaceable?

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.870
Use it only for me.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.530
Only for Knov-sama...

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.560
Understood?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.790
Y-Yes.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.260
Knov-sama really is the only one for me!

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.050
And why are you dressed like that?

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.700
Oh! No reason...

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.680
N-Nothing's going on!

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.110
Irreplaceable...

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.060
Then tell her to wait until
Kite's back to normal.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.140
I did.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.490
Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:02.290
forced into a relationship by Palm
Siberia, age 22, blood type A...

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.700
and dumped before he knew it.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.750
Meh... Again?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.810
That's the third one.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.810
Oh! A secret one!

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.750
Huh? Really?

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.920
Yeah, you can auction it on
the net for a lot of money.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.320
Then you can have it.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.330
Not interested.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.710
Did something happen?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.690
Hmm? Not really.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.090
Let's hit the gym.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.930
Okay!

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.580
Well?

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.770
Oh, I haven't noticed anything.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.140
They seem to be doing fine...

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.510
But we should continue to observe them.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.100
That will give them time to
conclude their business.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.600
While Knov and Shoot were observing
the mental state of Gon and Killua...

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.180
He's here.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.580
Who's this guy?

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.560
Not bad.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.930
He's fast.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.150
You're faster than the guys
I fought yesterday.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.040
But not by much.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.380
Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.720
Give me more meat!

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.090
You eat a lot.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.130
Bitter much?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.010
You mean, "Jealous much?"
