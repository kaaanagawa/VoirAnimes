WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
To become kings, the Chimera Ants
have spread across the world,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.280
committing acts of utmost
tyranny wherever they go.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.040
Fearing the damage will spread,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.370
the government asks the Hunter
Association to exterminate them.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.250
Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.190
Ah, is that all?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.970
Infiltration x And x Selection

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.940
Sneaking in was easy.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.710
But the question is how to get
close enough to the enemy.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.390
And we can't let just anyone see us, either.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.900
Informants

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.260
This country has a powerful
information regulation system that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.900
operates in secret using groups of informants.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.170
Informants?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.910
Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy,
you receive a reward.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.830
If you find evidence of insurgency,
you receive a reward.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.170
If you stop someone from fleeing the
country, you receive a reward.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.910
So the people will do anything for that reward.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.090
And they aren't just after money.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.710
After racking up enough informant points,
the entire group is promoted.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.650
But if someone provides false information
or a member commits a crime,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.140
the entire group is punished.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.480
Carrot and stick, huh?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.920
It's pretty nasty business.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.440
Family members are put in different groups.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.440
So if an entire group tries to escape,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.140
the other family members can be
executed or imprisoned for life.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.830
If a family is caught trying to escape together,
they'll be executed, no questions asked.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.170
For this country's elite to live the good life,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.330
the rest of its citizens must scrape by.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.530
But the media also spreads lies.
Such as that, in other countries,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.600
half the population starves by age ten.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.550
Foreign aid never reaches the needy.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.600
Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.220
It's even said that East Gorteau spends
grant money developing nuclear weapons

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.050
that become bargaining chips in negotiations
for unprecedented foreign aid increases.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.360
Hey, don't overheat!

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.250
I th-think I'm okay...

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.510
That was just so complicated...

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.980
But you sure know a lot about it.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.510
My brother told me everything.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.370
And he probably heard it from Grandpa.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.720
Your grandpa?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.760
Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated
the country for a job.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.240
And I've seen similar information
on Hunter websites.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.170
The system is likely still in use.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.500
There's a village.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.470
Yeah... It's not very big.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.300
What do we do?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.580
Sneak in.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.990
Is that a good idea?

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.410
We need current information.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.920
Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or
how to identify someone's rank will help.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.920
They may have certain practices to root out spies.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.130
The more data we have, the better.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.160
Wait here.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.860
It's completely deserted...

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.970
Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.470
No, something happened here.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.970
And someone's trying to hide it.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:34.880
Huh?

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.730
They did a sloppy job.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.510
They didn't dig deep enough,
so wild dogs got to the bodies.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.760
I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.630
What's going on?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.890
This is the true purpose of
the national celebration.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.770
It's a pretense for entire populations of towns
and cities to vanish without raising suspicion.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.330
The selection has already begun.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.770
In hindsight,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.500
it would be tough to summon all citizens to
the capital and make the selection so quickly.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.760
This nation has a population
of around five million.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.970
Clearing out one town or city
at a time is more effective.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.930
In that case, their only concern would
be coworkers or family members

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.330
raising a fuss over the missing.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.480
But with the pretext of the national celebration,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.270
no one will find it strange that
they can't contact someone.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.750
In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.920
so if they believe the other party is traveling,
it makes sense that they can't contact them.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.020
The selection will go very smoothly.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.090
The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.820
They only need to attack the farthest
towns first and work their way east.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:19.580
If each town is told that the government
will assign its people a time to depart,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.030
there won't be any problems regarding
communication between towns.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.210
So, by preventing people from meeting
between towns to travel together,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.490
they eliminate any cause for commotion.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.470
But...

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.240
Hmm?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.500
That means

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.370
they have to run around the nation
to attack all five million citizens.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.100
Yeah.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.610
If one percent survives, that gives
them fifty thousand soldiers.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.580
No, I mean before that.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.870
There are ten... No, nine days left.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.100
If you wanted to check five
million people in that time,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.120
you'd need a lot of help.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.960
Assuming that one <i>Nen</i> user

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.510
can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.630
Five hundred <i>Nen</i> users.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.130
Exactly!

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.980
You're getting at the fact that there can't
be that many Ants who can use <i>Nen</i>?

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.760
Yeah.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.300
I agree, but it probably isn't that hard.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.100
They don't need <i>Nen</i> users to check everyone.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.770
Huh? Why not?

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.770
They can use manipulation.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.040
The power that Chimera Ant used...

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.990
I'm guessing it can be used
to automate victims or,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.750
like Genthru's power, can probably be
used to control multiple people at once.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.520
Ordinary humans have aura as well,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.800
so the manipulator could force a
victim's aura to concentrate in his fist.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.710
One punch alone could create
an army of fifty thousand.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.370
While leaving four million, nine hundred
and fifty thousand dead in the process.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.420
Well, it isn't all bad news.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.330
If my theory is correct,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.330
causing a commotion to stop their
selection will be simple.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.480
We merely have to pop up,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.100
take out whoever is being controlled,
and cause a panic.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.160
Then we just encourage

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.550
the people who escape to
check on other towns nearby.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.350
If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled
puppets, rather than actual <i>Nen</i> users,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.290
taking them down will be a cinch.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.390
We'll just run around, taking them down
one after another, and wreak havoc.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.740
Yeah.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.220
The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.380
Once we make our move,
they'll know we're here.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.230
If we want to go with the old man's
plan, we should stay hidden.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.500
What do you think?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.390
Let's do it.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.250
If the selection has already begun,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.640
we can't just stand around watching.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.650
Okay, let's do it.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.660
Uh-huh!

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.670
But I'll do this alone.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.510
Huh?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.950
You stay in hiding.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.930
Why?

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.280
It'll go better if we both—

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.530
Don't forget our main mission!

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.280
Defeating that Chimera Ant.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.220
That should be your focus.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.920
Let me handle everything else.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.470
I'll stir things up.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.960
And no offense, but I work more easily alone.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.800
Jeez... Fine, I got it.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.640
Really?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.030
Huh?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.060
Do you really understand?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.790
Killua?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.940
Promise me you won't make a move!

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.220
Not even if people are killed
right before your eyes!

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.950
Promise!

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.220
I'll contact you by text.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.470
Our cell phones should still work in this area.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.350
Killua?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.360
Sorry... It's nothing!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.190
I'm just a little tense.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.860
What's this?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.870
They aren't citizens of this country.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.520
I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.280
But they're definitely strong...

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.870
Are they assassins?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.880
Are they here to hunt down the King?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.730
Then I can't ignore them...

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.890
But I don't want to fight them both at once.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.430
I definitely don't want to fight the
silver-haired one on the left.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.350
Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.030
As much potential as a Squadron Leader?

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.900
That kid is something special.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.780
I completely concealed my presence,
but he still sensed something?

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.810
How convenient!

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.560
Are you sure about this?

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.570
You'll really transport my family
and me to another country?

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.960
Do not worry.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.330
We have received official approval,
and prepared the necessary documents.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.330
All that's left is for you to sign the papers.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.820
However, the condition that you share
your complete knowledge of military affairs

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.980
in exchange for your freedom is essential.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.350
As mentioned in the agreement,

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.590
if you do not keep up your end after signing,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.600
we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.630
That won't be a problem.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.750
I'll tell you everything...

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:05.880
All I know about the atrocities
that Diego has committed.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.230
We appreciate it.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.370
Our lives are on the line, as well.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.810
"That Diego has committed"?

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.370
You talk like it doesn't concern you.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.140
The wine you're drinking and
the room you stand in

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.450
were earned by following that bastard.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.310
You mean "that we've committed,"
you son of a bitch.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.590
But I get it... We're here on business.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.390
So, Marcos-san...

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.980
Continue going about your business as normal.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.390
In two weeks, you and your family
will be relaxing on the beach.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.530
I can't accept it!

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.870
We're supposed to stand around,
watching as people are killed?

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.190
Are you sleepy?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.220
Want me to put you to sleep, eh?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.050
Calm yourself.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.990
If they're gonna check five
million citizens in ten days,

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.300
simple arithmetic says that's
five hundred thousand per day!

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.140
Of which one percent will survive!

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.060
And your point is?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.580
That means four hundred, ninety-five
thousand have already been killed!

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.690
How can you be so calm?

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.570
Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.210
If the plan fails, everyone dies.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.210
If we can't draw the three Royal
Guards away from the King,

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.830
not even the Chairman will
be able to defeat the King.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.340
Thus, we cannot let them discover
our existence before the time is right.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.490
If that happens, security around the
King will be even further tightened.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.350
You must endure this.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.100
You're telling me to sacrifice five
million to save the human race?

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.850
That's right.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.780
If blaming me consoles you, go ahead.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.570
But if you don't have a better idea,
don't be too self-righteous.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.990
Damn it...

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.500
We must do only what we can.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.500
But we must put our lives on the line to do so.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.190
Yeah...

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.810
Is Killua okay?

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.100
He was acting a little weird.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.880
Maybe I should have stuck with him?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.820
But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.600
You did well to avoid that.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.660
How about this?

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.850
I use my strong tail as a spring,
to propel me among the trees!

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.550
In the darkness, following my
movement is impossible!

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.760
Caught you!

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.670
Now I'm going to crush you!

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.670
You're not crushing me!

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:11.860
Huh?

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.330
I'm the one who caught <i>you</i>!

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.670
He seems to have a snake's genes,

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.120
so he should be able to go ten
days without starving to death.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.090
As I thought... He's strong...

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.050
But I should continue to observe.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.080
I already let them find me...

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.140
I need to hide better.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.240
But it's strange...

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.990
Why are there soldiers around if the
selection is already finished here?

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.540
Maybe there are extra guards
because we're near the border.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.150
An owl and a bat?

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.580
This time, he's facing two...

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.940
What will he do?

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.450
The Chimera Ants are using
darkness to attack Gon.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.860
And why is Meleoron following him?

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.340
Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.860
Come on down, everyone...

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.840
I have a perfectly ordinary box,
which has not been touched.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.090
One, two, three!

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.220
That would be an illusion.
