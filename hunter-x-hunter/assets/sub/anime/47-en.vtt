WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alone?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
I'm impressed.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.960
Where do you want to die?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.610
I'll humor any requests.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.920
I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,
with no one nearby.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.060
Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.040
Condition x And x Condition

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.770
Uvogin seeks to unleash
his rage upon Kurapika.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.200
And Kurapika intends to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.040
avenge his brethren against
the Phantom Troupe.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.420
An inevitable battle is about to begin.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.310
Yep, there they all go.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.130
All of these are leech eggs?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.070
That's disgusting...

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.310
Sorry about the wait.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.960
I've got a question for you.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.670
Who are you?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.480
You're no ordinary <i>Nen</i> user.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.600
I can sense a special intent
behind your <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.090
Before I can answer your question,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.430
I need you to tell me something.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.780
Do you remember the
people you've killed?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.020
A little.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.000
I can remember the people
who made an impression.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.940
So you want revenge?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.500
Who are you trying to avenge?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.630
The Kurta.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.040
Never heard of them.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.890
A small clan, with Scarlet Eyes,
that lived in the Lukso Province.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.140
Five years ago,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.080
you attacked us.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.940
Scarlet Eyes? What's that?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.900
The name of a treasure?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.770
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell...

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.400
But five years ago,
I was definitely a member.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.800
When you kill a completely
innocent bystander,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.510
what are you people thinking?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.200
What do you feel?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.670
Nothing at all.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.300
Scum!

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.930
You will atone through death!

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.440
Fools like you are the reason
I never get sick of killing.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.820
Wanna know what I enjoy most?

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.450
Denying those who come
in search of revenge!

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.600
Those chains are dangerous.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.600
I don't know what kind
of trick he used on them,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.200
<i>but they hold an abnormal amount of </i>Nen.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.610
Which means...

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.360
Strike first to win!

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.620
Got him.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.340
That's a surprise...

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.140
After taking that punch,
he still has the strength to attack?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.890
But his left arm is useless now.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.910
What?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.840
Unscathed?

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.650
Impossible...

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.000
<i>Considering the amount
of</i> Nen <i>in those chains,</i>

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.410
he must be a Manipulator or a Conjurer...

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.300
I would guess the former.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.180
But only an Enhancer should be
able to block my attack.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.440
What is he?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.880
Was that punch

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.050
the best you've got?

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.570
That wasn't even funny.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.450
Don't worry.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.940
That was twenty percent of my strength.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.010
This time, I'll use half!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.830
Here!

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.750
Damn!

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.220
Here!

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.190
Damn, he keeps darting around.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.100
But...

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.770
I'll regret not using that
chance to chain you up?

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.360
Stop making excuses,
and give me your best shot.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.870
You're wasting my time.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.300
Okay, kid.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.000
I'll give you all I've got!

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.630
That's an incredible aura.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.250
A smoke screen?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.470
His presence has disappeared.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.640
<i>He's using </i>In!

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.560
This time, I crushed your arm.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.110
No one can withstand

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.910
a full-strength Big Bang Impact.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.850
But I'm impressed.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.900
You reacted immediately.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.880
I'm guessing you noticed the
slight shift in the smoke.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.360
I am impressed, as well.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.180
I didn't think you knew how to use <i>In</i>.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.820
Striking the ground to
raise a smoke screen

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.810
was intended to conceal both your
physical body and your presence.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.650
However...

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.200
I, too, can use <i>In</i>.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.280
N-No way!

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.950
You can see them?

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.310
So you can use <i>Gyo</i>.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.570
These chains were fortified
with a Conjurer's <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.800
Meaning I can use <i>In</i> to
render them invisible.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.770
So you kept the chains out to trick us

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.310
into thinking they were real?

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.700
Precisely.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.760
I pretended to be a Manipulator
using <i>Nen</i>-controlled chains,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.150
so my enemies would only be
alert to the visible chains.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.200
And my bluff just paid off.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.200
While you were making empty threats,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.330
my chains were already
wrapped around your body.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.960
You've been captured.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.720
Damn... But how?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.140
He has an Enhancer's defensive power...

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.520
<i>And the </i>Nen <i>in his conjured
chains is incredibly strong...</i>

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:48.190
Has he fully mastered both
Enhancer and Conjurer techniques?

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.610
That's impossible.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:58.870
<i>A </i>Nen <i>user can only fully master
their innate category.</i>

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:58.870 line:20%
Enhancer

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.180
I see you're having trouble understanding.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.840
Let me illuminate you, before
sending you to the other side.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.640
Those eyes...

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.640
I remember now.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.180
There were a bunch of them,
in the middle of nowhere.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.150
The boss really liked those eyes.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.020
They were pretty strong!

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.280
Then, you're a survivor?

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.160
I'm getting fired up...

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.360
Let's see which is stronger,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.790
your grudge or my power!

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.750
Bastard...

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.170
Is that all you can think about?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.550
You'll never be able to break these chains!

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.810
Why? What's wrong?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.440
When my eyes turn scarlet,
I become a Specialist.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.070
What was that?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.030
When I am a Specialist,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.390
I wield full control over
every category of <i>Nen</i>.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.200 line:20%
Enhancer

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.200 position:80% line:50%
Transmuter
Conjurer

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.200 position:20% line:50%
Emitter
Manipulator

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.320
And this is my power...

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.460
Absolute Mastery
Emperor Time

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.460
Emperor Time!

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.250
Chains?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.150
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.100
that was the first thing that came to mind.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.260
Chains, huh...

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.690
Why's that?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.170
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.690
chained down to hell.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.700
Really, now?

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:04.080
I get the feeling that you're
actually just chaining yourself.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.250
What would you know?

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.670
Hey! Wait up!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.580
I'm your teacher!

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.540
I'm not finished talking!

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.500
Hold it right there...

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.280
Didn't you hear my explanation?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.440
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.680
And conjuring unbreakable
chains is impossible!

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.600
Ignoring me?

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.100
Man, you're so stubborn.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.610
It's impossible to conjure unbreakable chains.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.360
But it's possible to conjure
something very close.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.240
Really?!

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.550
Yeah, you only hear what you want to hear.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.120
What do I need?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.120
A condition and a condition.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.860
A condition and a condition?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.340
Yes, determine a condition...

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.540
in other words, a rule...

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.890
and swear to always follow it.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.140
The stricter the rule, the stronger
the power it will enable.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.890
<i>Normally,</i> Nen <i>is additive.</i>

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:13.650 line:20%
(Attack + <i>Nen</i>) x Condition Difficulty

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.380
<i>But a </i>Nen <i>technique with
conditions is multiplicative.</i>

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.170
Your strength will increase exponentially.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.670
Come up with a rule for your chains.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.550
One that you are prepared to follow.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.640
But let me warn you...

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.530
This technique is very volatile.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.670
It's a double-edged sword.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:33.920
<i>If you break the rule you set,
you could lose your </i>Nen.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.880
My objective is to find

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.670
my brethren's Scarlet Eyes

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.180
and to capture the spiders.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.080
I want chains that are

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.630
unbreakable by the spiders,
the Phantom Troupe.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.510
The spiders will be my only targets.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.670
So the rule is that you will use these
chains solely for that objective?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.190
That's a little weak.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.770
Don't get ahead of me.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.200
Using the chains exclusively on
spiders is only the prerequisite.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.200
Then what is your rule?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.730
I'll stake my life on it!

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.090
Hey, Kurapika...

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.090
When your eyes are scarlet,
your aura spikes.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.580
Could that mean...

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.490
<i>Let's try water divination again!</i>

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.850
A Specialist?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.260
You have full control over
every other category?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.850
That is correct.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.620
Holy Chain: Healing Thumb

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.660
I can use enhanced self-healing

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.870
to completely recover a broken arm.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.500
I shattered that arm,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.270
but he healed it instantly.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.260
There were a number of reasons why
I chose you to be my first target.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.970
While you fought the Mafia
and the Shadow Beasts,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.930
the other spiders stayed out of it altogether.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.730
That told me you preferred to fight alone,

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.990
and that they trusted that
your strength would prevail.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.990
I prefer to fight one-on-one.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.240
That made you a perfect target.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.870
An Enhancer who was confident
in his offense and defense.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:46.260
You met every condition I
required for my first target.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.860
Because then I could test if my Chain Jail

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.840
would be effective on the rest of the Troupe.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.350
Chain Jail forcefully activates <i>Zetsu</i>
upon any Troupe member it ensnares.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.940
It also paralyzes them.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.410
So that's why I can't muster any aura...

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.870
<i>Zetsu</i> nullifies aura.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.300
Meaning you'd need to use

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.800
physical strength alone to break these chains.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.050
Damn!

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.930
If the Troupe member with the most
physical strength cannot break the chains,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.430
the others will certainly be
unable to escape Chain Jail.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.940
<i>His forced activation of</i> Zetsu <i>here is bad...</i>

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.270
<i>Aura is the basis of all </i>Nen.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.520
If it's sealed off, you can't use your power.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.600
<i>A technique for sealing </i>Nen...

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.980
This guy thought everything through.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.220
It looks as though my enhanced fist

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.970
is slightly stronger than your physical brawn.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.290
That's valuable information.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:23.230
Then I can beat every Troupe member
barehanded, provided I've chained them.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.480
Tell me everything you know.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.800
Where are the other spiders?

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.990
Kill me.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.000
What abilities do they have?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.010
Kill me.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.650
It makes me sick...

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.560
The sensation left on my hand.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.170
The grating sound of each strike.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.190
The smell of blood!

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.870
It all throws my senses into disarray...

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.170
How can you do these things,
yet feel and think nothing at all?!

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.930
Answer me!

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.670
Kill me.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.610
This is your last chance.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.810
I just placed a conditional
bond on your heart.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.810
If you break the rule I set,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.040
the bond will activate,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.320
crushing your heart.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.950
Judgment Chain:
Arbiter Little Finger

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.660
The rule is that

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.760
you must answer my question honestly.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.860
Abide by that rule, and I shall
allow you to live a bit longer.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.210
Where are the other spiders?!

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.760
Die, fool.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.210
I spent too much time in that state...

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.140
It's me.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.020
Kurapika, what's going on?

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.870
Why didn't you call?

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.910
Are you okay?

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.990
Yeah.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.010
I'm glad to hear that...

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.010
What about on your side?

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.310
The boss is safe.
She's asleep in her room.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.300
Right, the boss' father won't arrive

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.130
until late tonight, due to
weather complications.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.340
I see.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.790
I understand.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.110
A chain user...

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.980
He's either a Manipulator or a Conjurer.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.460
Uvogin is a dominant fighter.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.260
But in a one-on-one fight, he is most
vulnerable to those two categories.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.380
Many Conjurers give special powers

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.240
to the things that they create.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.490
Some of those abilities could
render Uvo helpless.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.090
And a Manipulator could
manipulate Uvo himself.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.890
I should have tagged along!

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.640
Damn!

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.890
If he fails to return by dawn,

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.880
there will be a change in plans.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:38.480
Shalnark senses the danger,
as Uvogin fails to return.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.200
Their leader, Chrollo,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.950
prepares to terminate the chain user.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.940
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.610
and Killua's

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.410
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.750
It's Gon

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.490
and Killua's

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.730
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:15.370
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.580
Today, we introduce Uvogin.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.660
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.590
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.420
He has a giant body.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.660
A master Enhancer,

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.260
His special attack is a <i>Nen</i>-infused straight right,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.370
with the Troupe's
toughest, strongest body.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.710
Big Bang Impact!

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.870
Next Time: Very x Sharp x Eye.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.800
So sharp, it's like a razor.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.650
Ooh, sounds great!
