WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
You removed the needle, didn't you?

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.860
Yeah.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.860
I feel a lot better.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.360
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.590
Kill?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.490
Me?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.960
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
<i>Family</i> is off limits.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.010
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.040
They're all thinking

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.160
the same thing!

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.680
Fine...

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.470
I'll beat you at your own game.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.980
Needles x And x Debt

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.740
To save Gon, Killua is heading
for the city with Alluka.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.820
Hisoka, who is working with Illumi to kill Alluka,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.310
confronted Gotoh and the other
butlers escorting them.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.440
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.520
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.260
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.270
He must have used his power.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.540
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.500
You've said too much.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.800
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.060
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.810
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.320
Rubbish!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.830
Catch.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.360
Were my eyes just accustomed
to your attack that time?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.840
It looked slower.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.840
Yeah, it was a lot slower.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.600
Because I diverted some
power to make them spin.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.370
If you don't release your ability,
you'll be strangled by your own aura.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.270
Or would you prefer your body riddled with holes?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.380
Pick your poison.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.630
Bungee Gum, undo.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.740
He dodged my attack from that position?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.980
He's fast.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.410
I can't follow him!

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.990
I sent my gum out with the first card...

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.600
So it would be ready to activate anytime

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.770
after I removed the gum from my feet.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.480
Now,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.780
this evil magician has a lethal pop quiz for you.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.450
I took twenty-two coins from your attack.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.440
How many coins will I return to you?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.200
He's going to use the gum to send
the coins flying back at me?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.200
You will have to find out for yourself.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.710
Gum, undo.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.320
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.450
Even if the answer is greater than twenty-two,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.960
I'll shoot them all down!

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.120
The answer is

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.670
enough to kill you.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.590
A lethal pop quiz doesn't
need to be answered.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.950
Forty kilometers until we reach the next town.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.720
I should last that long...

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.130
Alluka, you're gonna feel a little zap again.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.960
Okay, it's fine.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.040
Godspeed!

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.460
Speed of Lightning!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.280
Very impressive...

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.940
If he runs at that speed on pavement,
I won't be able to catch up on my own.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.360
Amane, it's me.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.000
Master Killua is headed for Parasta.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.960
I need you to follow the road.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.240
Canary, come with me.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.620
With my grandmother's motorcycle,
it'll be faster with two riders.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.490
This is...

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.820
My grandmother.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.890
Hang on tight.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.540
We'll be using our auras as fuel,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.510
so this will be more tiring than if you were to run.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.700
Be prepared.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.400
Here we go.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.430
Found them.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.140
Seriously?

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.930
I know I'm carrying Alluka,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.190
but Speed of Lightning is at full power!

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.390
Damn!

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.450
If I go this way,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.610
you can't follow on a motorcycle!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600
What now?

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.880
We'll beat him there.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.960
Beat him where?

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.480
At Master Killua's speed, it'll take less
than ten minutes to reach Parasta.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.440
It'll take Master Illumi over twenty minutes by car.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.720
What will he do with his ten-minute lead?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.870
Disguise himself?

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.800
Wrong. Cute answer...

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.230
Though not impossible, I suppose.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.390
What's the first thing Master Killua
will want to do after he loses us?

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.080
Contact his friends.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.610
Bingo.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.930
And how can he contact his friends
without us finding out?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.620
Um...

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.920
He'll need to check for any
tracing or listening devices,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.870
and use someone else's phone.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.490
That's mere common sense.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.460
Think about what matters in this situation!

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.780
We may know where Master Killua is,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.410
but if we can't get near him,
we won't know what he's doing.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.470
So where is he going?

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.480
You've figured it out?

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.060
Let's go, then!

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.880
We've been waiting for you.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.310
Damn, you guys aren't bad.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.660
We've already prepared an airship.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.550
Great, how many?

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.680
Huh?

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.250
Sounds like you only have one.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.650
Are you serious about this?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.720
Without at least five or six airships heading
to different places, we'll never lose Illumi!

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.160
Split up, and make the arrangements.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.790
This airship will take us to our destination.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.940
Is that okay?

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.730
Yes.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.790
We'll have to pay for two tickets,
or they'll figure out it's unmanned.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.250
I know that! Do you take me for a fool?

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.770
What does this say?

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.140
Ask the clerk.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.110
What names should we put the tickets under?

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.090
Look, can't you do anything by yourself?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.570
Where's Master Killua?

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.880
Crap!

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.570
Hey! You were pestering me as a distraction,
weren't you? You helped them escape!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.770
What are you talking about?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.370
We have to follow them!

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.670
I'll let you handle that.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.270
Once I've dispatched the other
flights, I'll ride one of them.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.330
If you follow them on the ground,
be sure you aren't followed.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.860
What are you talking about?

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.840
If you follow them by air, it'll be more obvious!

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.010
That wasn't my plan.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.660
I can serve as a decoy.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.960
And since I plan to join up with Gotoh,
it'll be easier to move by airship.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.760
What is it?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.890
The real you is pretty cute.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.020
I'm sure that Master Killua will
like you more that way.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.320
A-Are you making fun of me?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.370
Nope.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.370
I really mean it.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.440
Gotoh...

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.650
Hello? It's me, Killua.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.060
Oh, what happened?

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.520
I was getting worried.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.000
I can't get in touch with Gotoh-san.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.660
Got it. I'll try calling him.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.000
Your older brother wants to
kill your younger brother?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.040
Yeah.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.570
Alluka's the only one who can heal Gon.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.050
But Illumi wants to kill Alluka.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.230
Because he thinks that my wish may
end up wiping out the entire family.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.820
We were too late...

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.300
Why don't we just wait for
them around the hospital?

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.130
The closer we get to the hospital,
the more likely we are to fail.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.580
Killua's friends will be in the vicinity.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:21.090
And if we just hang around waiting,
they'll realize something isn't right.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.340
Eight... We need more people.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.330
Will you bring in more allies?

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.320
But I'm pretty shy...

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.990
No, I have no more allies.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.860
Seems like a waste, but I guess I'll use my needles.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.870
That's some nice aura.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.080
If I stick them in someone and give orders,
they'll work hard for me until death.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.890
Though, they usually die from working too hard.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.430
Grant a wish?

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.760
That's a pretty scary power.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.020
If segregationists knew about
that, they'd be all over it.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.470
Illumi will probably follow the airships by ground.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.530
My butlers have dispatched seven decoys.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.820
My brother doesn't usually rely on others,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.840
so he'll probably use Needlemen.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.530
Needlemen?

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.660
He uses special needles, which carry <i>Nen</i>,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.700
to create soldiers that fight to the death for him.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.320
He sacrifices ordinary civilians to do it.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.800
Illumi's powerful aura enters
the victims through the needles,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.960
so the moment they're pierced,
they turn into vegetables.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.130
Morel, I need you to get some Hunters

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.700
to take the Needlemen into custody.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:11.050
If we have proof that he's harmed
multiple innocent civilians beyond recovery,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.340
then it's okay to hunt him down,
even if he's a pro Hunter, right?

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:25.350
Killua sought this confirmation because of
what the fourth Hunter Commandment said.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.220
Hunter Commandment #4...

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.440
A Hunter may never target another Hunter.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:40.010
However, this does not apply to Hunters
who commit heinous criminal acts.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.660
I believe some of the candidates were talking about

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.760
changing the Commandments and Hunter Exam.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.630
If we catch Illumi,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.740
a lot of people who agree with
those views will come forward.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.870
Killua, are you really going to sell your brother out?

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.270
I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt Alluka.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.390
Not even if he's my own brother.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.010
I'll do whatever it takes

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.520
to crush him.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.740
I understand.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.320
Teradein and Bushidora will
probably agree to help.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.900
There should be many Hunters
who will gladly lend a hand.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.550
Since you're coming to the city
where the Hunter Association HQ is,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.500
you'll be right under our noses.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.160
But I'll make sure everyone understands
how dangerous our opponent is.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.670
The mission will be to secure the
Needlemen, not to go after Illumi.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.030
Yeah, that's fine.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.060
I've accessed Parasta Airport's flight records.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:06.270
There are six airships landing within twenty
to thirty kilometers of the hospital.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.370
We don't know where Killua
and his butlers will land.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.010
And Illumi can't pursue what he can't see.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.330
Illumi and the Needlemen will try to
stay in visual range of the airships,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.530
as they follow on the ground.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.150
They will be vulnerable to attack
at a number of points before

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.180
they reach Swaldani City, where the hospital is.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.530
So we need to send Hunters to those points.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.950
Our top priority is recovering the Needlemen.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.100
We can confirm if there are needles afterward.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.550
Capture anyone who approaches the airship!

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.460
Yes, sir!

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.350
Be on your way!

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.480
Go!

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.830
Hisoka, can you dispose of the fakes for me?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.240
Okay.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.530
I will be busy.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.750
I always knew the fourth Commandment
was fundamentally wrong.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.720
We can't wait for a villain like this to appear!

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.840
The Association's honor will be sullied.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.390
The exam needs to be more strict.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.170
If they were required to behave
properly before joining,

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.360
we wouldn't have this problem.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.650
So the time has come...

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.180
For the three of us, the anti-chairman faction,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.650
to leave the Association.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.650
Heart Is Valuable

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.650
Hello, everyone.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:41.410
Today, I—Teradein—Loupe, and
Bushidora have joined forces.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.200
We three are commonly known
as the anti-chairman faction,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.420
but that is not a name of our choice.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.920
The Hunter souls within us were inherited
from the former chairman, I assure you.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.910
And so, to carry out his will,

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:10.150
we seek to reform the highly versatile team
to which the former chairman belonged,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.690
Seirin Group

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.680
the legendary Seirin Group.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.200
Teradein, the leader.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.340
Loupe, the second-in-command.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:26.950
And I, Bushidora, will serve
as captain of the troops.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.950
In this election, as an expression of our solidarity,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.460
we request that all votes go
to Teradein, the leader.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.650
We hope that everyone who agrees

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.840
with our message will vote
for our comrade Teradein.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.980
Now, as we address our message,

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:55.230
we have received trustworthy
information from a reliable source

00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:02.070
stating that multiple parties have found
a certain Hunter guilty of many foul crimes.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.500
We are currently pursuing this Hunter.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:18.550
let us come together to rebuild the
Hunter Association with wisdom and integrity!

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.720
And so, the conflict within
the Zoldyck family over Alluka

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.040
grows in intensity as it now involves
the Hunter Association chairman election.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.380
Teradein and his allies seek
to control the Association.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.720
As the election continues,
Illumi manages to capture Killua.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.240
Next time: Sin x And x Claw.
