WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They can't avenge them because

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
they're too busy arguing over
whether they're dead or mutated?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.150
Nothing's changed.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.950
They always lose sight of what's important.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.990
We're going to do things our way.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.120
If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.120
Don't worry.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.000
Carnage x And x Devastation

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.940
The Chimera Ant Zazan has
built her nest in Meteor City.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.890
Calling herself the Queen,
she seeks to conquer the world.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.150
The ones who have risen to quell her
ambitions are inhabitants of this city...

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.440
The Phantom Troupe.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.870
Where's everyone else?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.160
Beats me...
Maybe still playing around?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.030
Rather than obliterating my opponent,
I should have enjoyed myself...

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.930
That took longer than expected...

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.730
I should break my habit

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.760
of beating my targets to a pulp.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.170
You're no match for me!

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.090
Come back when you're stronger.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.240
Fair point.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.640
My, you took that well.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.900
Looks like I've lost my touch.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.110
But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.920
I'm stuck on defense...

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.450
He's fast, and has twice as many limbs.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.050
I need to create an opening.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.770
Again?

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.450
Now I'm certain...

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.640
The moment I think I'm rid of it,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.080
she pulls that vacuum cleaner
out of nowhere again.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.600
Her power lets her pull out
and store objects at will?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.390
I see... Very interesting...

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.160
And I can't catch her with my sticky webs.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
This girl is good,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.080
but I can't let her get away.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.610
This technique is a literal pain in the ass.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.590
But I have no choice!

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.270
Love Shower!

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.350
Radiating Love

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.230
Uh-oh, there may be no way out of this one...

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.530
If I keep the webs coming, you can't escape...

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.240
Lucky me!

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.490
Caught you!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.640
It's no use...

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.000
Even Bihorn-sama, strongest among us,
couldn't snap these webs.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.010
Now, then...

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.500
I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.920
Will Zazan-sama praise me?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.640
It got lighter?

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.770
Impossible—

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.650
How?!

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.650
How did she escape?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.530
Huh?

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.540
I get it...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.690
You ditched your clothes.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.540
I understand.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.790
She widened an opening in my web to
slip through, while protecting her skin.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.300
With her power, it's feasible.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.560
She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.850
But after escaping, she can make it
disappear and call it to her again.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.240
However!

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.750
Now that you've removed your clothes,
you can't use the same trick again!

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.970
The same applies to you.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.200
I've learned the range and speed of your webs.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.450
And I won't mention that his anus
twitches twice before he fires.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.460
You won't catch me again.
I'll keep my distance.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.210
Blinky and I have won.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.450
Won?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.340
Such a stupid girl...

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.120
You can't do anything while running away.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.130
I said that I'll keep my distance,

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.720
but I didn't say anything about running.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.190
I'll show you the difference.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.620
Blinky...

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.480
Suck every last drop of blood from his body.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.240
What... Wh-Wh-What?

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.740
Stop it!

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.700
H-Hey...

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.750
Y-You little...

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.850
Weakling!

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.870
Uh-oh, this is bad...

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.870
I'm getting dizzy.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.100
I have to stop the blood loss!

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.400
(How's that?)

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.150
(Now you can't suck my blood...)

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.430
There's more?

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.590
From here?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.040
And here?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.380
I... I can't block everywhere!

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.430
You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.400
Based on currently available information,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.050
it's impossible for you to cover
each wound with your eight limbs...

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.200
Not without another ace in the hole.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.690
All cleaned up.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.170
Huh?

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.880
Hmm...

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.910
Ah, you know those webs
you were shooting out?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.380
By covering your body with them,
couldn't you have stopped the bleeding?

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.380
We're both pretty stupid...

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.000
What is this?

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.080
How can they move so fast?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.520
Looks like he's moving a little better now.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.760
He has a ways to go before
he's back to full strength.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.710
They were already here, enjoying the show.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.520
I wasted some time fooling around,
but I was by no means slow...

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.840
Five?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.280
No, seven?

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.530
How many feints was that?

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.180
And how can he leap from
that position while attacki—

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.580
Ah! He's already over there!

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.050
I can't believe it...

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.020
<i>He's on a completely
different level.</i>

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.580
Whoa, everyone's already here?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.010
Going for a new look?

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.820
I got caught in my opponent's webs.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.590
Wait, you actually lost—

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.520
I won.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.430
She's really mad!

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.200
Feitan's the only one left.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.550
His opponent's pretty strong.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.710
It's probably the Queen.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.560
But Feitan looks sluggish.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.620
He isn't back to full strength yet...

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.710
We know! You already said that!

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.200
I'm still too weak.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.440
Behind me?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.110
What's with this guy?

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.110
He keeps getting faster?

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.290
And more of his buddies keep showing up.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.050
Curse those worthless idiots!

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.540
All of them were defeated?!

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.150
I didn't think your skin would be so tough.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.150
Cur...

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.280
Curse you!

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.430
How dare you damage my face?!

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.470
I'll kill you!

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.110
Ko!

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.390
She left herself wide open.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.700
I'm not nice enough to overlook that.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.890
Her attack didn't hit him...

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.010
No, she sent a little aura with that swing.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.850
Feitan's idea to use <i>Ko</i> backfired.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.660
After focusing his aura into one point,
he didn't expect to deal no damage.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.350
The miscalculation left him a second
late guarding with his <i>Nen.</i>

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.910
In other words, he was basically defenseless.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.960
A puny Emitter attack could
have dealt serious damage.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.020
She knows how to use her aura.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.370
She has good reason to call herself Queen.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.370
This body has no weaknesses!

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.120
Shouldn't we help him?

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.120
Huh? Why?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.120
This is a race...

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.680
If he loses, the next person gets to try.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.040
Who's up next?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.280
We use order of arrival.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.850
That's me, then.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.040
Wait...

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.260
We both arrived at the same time.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.170
Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.940
Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.940
S-Something's...

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.030
wrong with them!

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.340
Heads.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.620
Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.780
Bah.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.780
I was naïve...

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.790
I thought I could become
number two in no time.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.450
But I'm utterly outclassed...

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.070
It's hopeless.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.180
But I won't give up.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.800
I'm used to toughing it out.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.550
All for the sake of retrieving my brother,
no matter how long it takes.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.150
There goes his left arm.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.240
Fei, wanna trade places?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.160
"Piece of crap..."

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.660
"Know your place."

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.540
Crap, run for it...

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.920
You're gonna get caught in it.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.090
When he snaps, he'll hit
everything around him!

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.670
We tried to watch him once
before and almost died.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.240
His power has a huge range,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.400
and activates with his anger,
so it knows no restraint.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.160
If you get caught up in the
one he's using this time,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.680
you're dead, Kalluto.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.840
This time?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.000
The attack has other forms?

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.000
Darn, I want to see!

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.400
What?

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.220
When did he put that on?!

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.730
Wait... More importantly,
he's much stronger now!

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.980
"Now I return your pain."

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.030
Feel the heat...

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.490
Pain Packer
Unforgiven

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.100
Pain Packer!

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.050
Rising Sun.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.760
Burnt by the Sun

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.810
"Is it hot?"

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.560
"Throat too scorched to even breathe?"

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.550
"You could try to run."

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.820
"Assuming you can even move..."

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.930
"What's wrong?"

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.560
"Make use of that tough body you're so proud of."

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.060
Impossible...

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.070
I am the Queen...

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.250
I cannot die here...

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.470
Out of fuel already?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.630
And the heat wasn't that strong...

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.000
How unfortunate...

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.900
You could have had a quicker death
if you'd dealt me more damage.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.010
Well, you only have yourself to blame.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:40.170
They didn't revert after the Queen's death...

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.840
But they're no longer under the Queen's control.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.910
Ple... ...me...

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.700
Please... ki...

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.710
Please... kill... me...

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.170
Please...

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.640
Kill us...

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.950
Hell, no.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.650
I don't do mercy killings.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.150
Attack me, trash!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.080
You were living in this place, right?!

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.080
Have the guts to defend it to the end!

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.650
You can die with a bang!

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.400
Now those geezers

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.230
are arguing over whether to exact
revenge upon the real queen.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.830
Man, I'm sick of those idiots.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.990
All they do is sit around a table,
squawking about doing the impossible.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.610
But you're still sticking around, right?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.250
There's nothing else for me to do.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.620
If more Ants show up,
I'll wipe them out at once.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.000
So I don't have to do any more cleanup.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.000
Is it the boss?!

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.960
No, it's Nobunaga.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.970
He's asking if we'll help with his job.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.530
What was that?

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.020
No way, fool!

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.890
Man, this sucks.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.650
I hate having to wait.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:01.400
Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.910
He's being very feminine.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.620
Eh?

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.270
What was that, bastards?!

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.620
Say that again...

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.660
I'll kill you!

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.600
Hey! We're hurt!

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:20.040
The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor
City from the Chimera Ant invasion.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.090
Meanwhile...

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.820
Gon and Killua are preparing to
infiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:47.200
The selection of citizens to present
to the King by his own guards...

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.590
...will begin in nine days.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.590
Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.270
Meleoron the Chameleon.
Meleoron the Chameleon.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.370
Meleoron the Chaleleron!

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.510
Meleoron the Chameleon...

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.240
Meleoron the Chameleon!
