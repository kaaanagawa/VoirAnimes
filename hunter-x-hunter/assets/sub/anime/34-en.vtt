WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
Heavens Arena.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.280
The 251-story, 991-meter building

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.530
is a mecca for fighters.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.420
When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.460
and receive a corresponding reward.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.030
After reaching the 100th floor,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.170
you are assigned a private room.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.610
After reaching the 200th floor,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.010
the Floor Masters, in an
intense battle of survival.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.880
This is the best stage

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.890
a warrior could ask for.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.730
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.230
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.240
Then I just need to find three more chumps.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.020
And I'll be a Floor Master.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.720
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.920
Move, and I will kill you...

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.850
Use <i>Nen</i>, and I will kill you.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.620
Make a sound, and I will kill you.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.280
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.540
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.770
If you know, slowly open your eyes.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.700
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.450
Never show your filthy face to us again.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.780
That's a promise.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.790
Power x To x Avenge

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.770
There are many who would use

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.730
underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.700
On the other hand,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Gon has concentrated on improving
his <i>Nen</i> and growing stronger.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.640
And tonight,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.830
he has his battle with Sadaso.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.310
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.040
I was overcome with despair.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.060
The second he looked at me,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.730
I felt a difference in strength

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.850
that made me realize my
helplessness against him.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780
It was a mistake to underestimate him,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.950
and to assume he was some normal kid.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.600
I'm gonna disappear

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.840
because I don't wanna die...

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.750
Be careful.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.990
You guys are next.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.800
What should we do?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.980
I'm still in.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.260
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.860
I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.620
Ten victories in the 200s

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.870
win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.260
Should you triumph, you get
an entire floor to yourself.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.030
And once you've earned the
title of Floor Master,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.270
you can lecture, serve as an advisor,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.000
or start a new martial arts school.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.170
You can live off the title for
the rest of your life.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.580
Will that kid try threatening us?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.360
The boy doesn't know my power.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.260
As long as we're careful, we can handle him.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.420
You're wrong.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.020
It's irrelevant to me what your power is.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.480
I can threaten you whenever I want.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.790
Whenever and wherever I choose...

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.170
When you're sound asleep...

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.390
When you're taking a dump.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.220
Got it?

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.190
Now, listen up.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.570
You have to follow the rules.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.570
Without rules,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.630
we are the ones who would benefit.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.260
Cheating really is a bad idea.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.400
We'll have a fair fight.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.270
Right.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.660
Time has run out for Sadaso.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.600
Gon wins by default!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.260
What? Again?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.790
What is Sadaso doing?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.050
June 1st

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.580
June 2nd

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.500
June 3rd

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.050
June 4th

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.020
Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.550
Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.090
Are you feeling all right?

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.930
Yes.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.190
Gon-kun, this will be your
second match with Gido.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.200
So you shouldn't require much advice.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.070
Do you have a plan?

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.320
Uh-huh.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320
Um, Wing-san, actually...

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.700
I'm planning to use this.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.080
I see...

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.680
Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match...

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.740
Gido versus Gon.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.060
In their previous encounter,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.220
Gon ended up in the hospital,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.880
but what will happen this time?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.010
Today, he's carrying a fishing rod.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.850
How does he plan to use it?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.150
How does he intend to fight?

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.480
Let's get this contest started!

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.570
Points and KO system.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.080
No time limit!

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.610
Begin!

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.410
Wow! Gon's already taken off!

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.040
But Gido was also prepared, as he's
already using Tornado Top!

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.100
If Gon charges in,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.960
he'll be in the same position as before.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.740
So he anticipated that.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.800
I know exactly what you're thinking...

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.770
Once I've begun to spin,
it's extremely hard to stop me.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.520
Thus, the logical course

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.270
would be a preemptive attack before I start.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.940
What's wrong?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.240
If you won't make a move, I'll go first.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.840
Shotgun Blues!

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.990
Shotgun Blues

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.370
He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.490
This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.640
Every top will be aiming for you.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.620
You can't avoid them all!

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.800
Ren!

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.130
What?

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.280
He stopped them!

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.860
Did you see that?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.140
Wow...

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.510
Incredible!

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.890
He stopped the tops in their tracks!

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.530
He clearly isn't the same
person as two months ago!

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.620
His Nen defense is far stronger now.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.990
I can't win with my tops?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.290
Gon's reflexes are good enough

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.250
to let him use his rod to knock down any tops

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.800
that are stupid enough to come straight at him.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.950
But he chose to use Ren

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.300
to deal more psychological damage.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.010
He must be pretty mad

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.320
about how they used Zushi.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.310
It's my turn now!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.430
Well, what technique will Gon use?

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.440
If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.070
he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.200
But it won't be that simple.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.190
There he goes...

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.370
Straight for Gido!

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.790
I knew it.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.960
But that won't do you any good!

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.470
Oh, his attack missed!

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.720
What were you aiming at?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.740
What?!

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.190
Unbelievable...

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.070
Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.590
Wait!

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.860
G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.740
Gido can no longer continue to fight.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.340
If you're willing to do whatever it takes,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.190
I won't hold back.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.340
And if you touch Zushi again,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.300
I'll smash your face in!

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.200
Our winner is Gon!

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.400
Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.210
His record in the 200s is now 2-1!

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.780
Okay, it's my turn now.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.470
All right, up next is our main event...

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.190
Killua versus Riehlvelt!

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.470
Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.100
this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.290
What will his strategy be?

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.770
You're the ones who broke your promise.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.150
I won't let you win now.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.740
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.360
An underworld dweller, huh?

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.200
This boy may be a professional there,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.100
but Heavens Arena is my turf.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.010
I'll show him that, on this square stage,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.490
I'm better.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.240
Fight, Killua-san!

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.640
Points and KO system.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.040
No time limit!

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.750
Begin!

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.350
He disappeared?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.310
Behind me!

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.670
Aura Burst!

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.560 line:20%
Aura Burst

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.940
Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.120
He uses the propulsion created
by releasing his stored aura

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.820
to control his wheelchair at will.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.070
I moved too fast.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.120
Whew, that was close...

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.450
Twin Snakes:

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.200
Song of Defense!

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.260 line:20%
Song of Defense

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.670
There it is!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.330
His Song of Defense...

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.970
Riehlvelt protects himself with two
whips moving at ridiculous speed,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.170
while he awaits his opportunity to strike.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.760
You planned to attack first and take the lead.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.440
Too bad it didn't work...

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.610
Now that I've switched to this stance,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.030
you have no chance of winning.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.410
Why not?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.700
That should be obvious.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.290
A normal person can't even see the whips move!

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.540
And this small ring offers no
means to hide or escape.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.840
Take this!

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.610
Sorry, but I'm not a normal person.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.170
What?!

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.740
But...

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.500
<i>Thunder Snake!</i>

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.500
True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.180
I'm astonished, Killua.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.140
You're the first person I've fought

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.020
who could see my whips move.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.520
So I have a present for you...

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.650
Together, my whips carry a
one million volt current.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.600
Enough to paralyze and
incapacitate the largest of men.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.400
Any fool who resists my whips

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.040
will fall prey to Thunder Snake!

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.450
I'm accustomed to electrical currents

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.660
from the torture training I've endured.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.040
It has no effect on me.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.730
But that just means I can bear the pain.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.800
It still hurts.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.180
That's why I'm a little pissed.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.270
If you fall from that height, you'll die!

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.060
What do you want?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.280
P-Please catch me!

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.230
Okay.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.980
Just come to me.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.960
Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.220
Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.090
Our winner is Killua!

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.980
Nice, Killua!

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.890
You're up next.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.390
You're fighting him in six days?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.620
Uh-huh, June 10th.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.560
My win was only possible
because of who I am...

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.740
If you're hit by those electric whips,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.090
you'll be knocked out cold.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.130
Yeah.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.010
What's your plan?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.760
Don't worry. I have an idea.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.120
Oh?

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.130
In spirit, you were fighting
even as you watched me.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.770
I guess you prefer actual combat
to being a spectator.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.770
June 9th

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.800
It appears that the damage

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.730
Gido suffered in his match
with Gon was so severe,

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.170
he hasn't returned for today's fight.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.390
Killua wins by default.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.660
June 10th

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.850
After losing to Killua,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.310
Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3,
leaving him no more chances.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.940
As you know, after four losses,
you're out of the contest.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.730
You'll have to start over from the beginning.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.110
He appears wary of Gon's speed,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.580
as he already has his whips out.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.700
Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod...

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.670
How does he plan to fight?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.090
Begin!

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.840
Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.090
Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.100
Oh, Gon is squatting?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.290
Amazing...

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.990
He pried a floor tile loose by himself!

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.950
And then he threw it!

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.160
Aura Burst!

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.740
Whoa, he barely managed to escape!

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.000
He left that escape route open on purpose.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.970
What?

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.110
However, Gon has already anticipated him.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.870
When you try to escape,
every fraction of a second counts.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.490
And since there isn't time to change direction,

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.800
you're forced to move forward...

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.380
And when you dash quickly,
you're usually off-balance.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.480
His only option is to stop the whips.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400
That's where you get him...

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.420
This is the switch?

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.690
Let's see...

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.860
I'll turn the power to maximum.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.800
S-Stop...

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.190
Switch

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.190
Stop it!

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.070
on!

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.120
Just kidding.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.700
Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.830
Our winner is Gon!

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.830
Gon-san!

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.320
Yes, that truly was impressive.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.600
I can see the progress you've made

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.870
from these last two fights.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.250
Feel free to pick a time and place...

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.830
I shall be your opponent.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.370
Hisoka has recognized the strength

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.760
Gon demonstrated during his matches.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.200
Their fight will soon begin.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:15.960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.640
Today, we introduce Cocco.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.660
A Heavens Arena
commentator.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.440
She's a Heavens Arena commentator.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.040
Oh, the lady who's always talking?

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.920
She knows how to get
the crowd excited.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.090
I wonder how many of her there are.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.460
Uh, there's just one!

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.300
Next time: The x True x Pass!

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.260
Hey, Killua.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.300
What does "yadda yadda" mean?

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.660
You don't know?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.930
It means ya da and ya da.
