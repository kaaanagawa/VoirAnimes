WEBVTT

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.230
I saw him back at the staircase...

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.870
Did he do it?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.780
Sorry, but what's about to happen is

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.510
just me blowing off some steam.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.980
Strong x Or x Weak

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.820
He disappeared?

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.140
Godspeed.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.960
The difference in initial action
speed was so overwhelming

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.160
that Youpi had no time to
make a sound or transform.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.880
Killua's Godspeed placed an
electrical burden upon his own body,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.410
making it possible for his body to
perform at a level far beyond

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.260
what should have been possible.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.980
Killua had divided this power
into two different abilities:

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.040
Speed of Lightning, which allowed
him to control his body at will,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.450
Speed of Lightning

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.710
and Whirlwind, which allowed his body
to react automatically to his opponent.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.460
Whirlwind

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.480
In a previous fight, he'd used the
latter to stop his opponent's dart.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.400
A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.690
to vibrations in aura that
indicate the opponent's hostility.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.050
The attack bypasses commands from his brain,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.620
unleashing attacks that transcend his
own limits by relying on reflexes alone,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.570
allowing him to easily surpass
his opponent's physical speed.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.880
What's going on here?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.310
All of these guys have less than
ten percent of my raw power.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.820
This makes no sense...

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.190
I can't do a thing against him.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.490
Whirlwind!

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.520
Profound...

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.030
This "aura" stuff is intense...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.550
This is getting interesting.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.010
Before my explosion, I never would
have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.260
Youpi's change in heart would lead him
to make an unbelievable choice,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.520
but this would not happen until later.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.090
Crap!

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.530
I used it all up!

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.780
Hold it!

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.500
You're not getting away!

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.330
You're seeing this through with me...

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.370
Until you die!

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.640
He disappeared?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.760
Again.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.050
He vanished, as though he were
never here to begin with.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.560
That's it...

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.410
At least one of them must have the ability

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.550
to make people appear and disappear at will.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.320
Huh?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.280
Please enter your passcode.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.660
Damn, I didn't get a code.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.840
Your passcode and name do not match.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.930
Please reenter your passcode.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.840
A second input error will result in your restraint.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.720
He came down here without a passcode?

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.490
Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.740
The door has been locked.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.230
Please enter your passcode.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.900
This is my chance!

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.100
I have two options.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.510
The elevator will fill with
sleeping gas eventually.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.240
Once he's asleep, I have to decide.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.130
One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.510
Monitor Room

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.780
and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.750
This way, when he wakes up,
he'll still be stuck in the elevator.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.730
But there's a high risk that someone above
will notice that the elevator isn't coming up.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.900
Two, I move Brovada somewhere
else while he's asleep.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.270
There are plenty of trucks parked around.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.280
And the warehouse doors require a
passcode to open from the inside.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.910
When he wakes up, Brovada won't
be able to open them.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.410
And if I use the cargo entrance
to return to the surface,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.920
the risk that I'll encounter enemies will
be much lower than if I take the elevator.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.800
No! That won't work!

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.070
I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.680
That's the safest option!

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.930
Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse,
and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.930
That's the least it'll take!

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.270
I'll stick the barrel of my gun through
the gap in his armor and open fire.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.430
Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.200
but he had never killed anyone
with his own hands before.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.320
Enter your passcode at once.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.460
If a passcode is not entered
within thirty seconds,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.810
the restraining process will begin.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.220
The monitor room in the border guard area...

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.470
There should be a monitor
for the elevator camera,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.450
and a button to open the doors!

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.630
Well, I'm outside now,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.300
but I had to destroy the elevator...

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.030
Is there another exit?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.420
I was naïve...

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.580
I didn't expect him to shoot the door.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.680
What now?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.690
Do I wait for him to lower his guard,
then sneak out the cargo entrance?

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.810
Or do I wait for him to leave?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.330
Either way, if he goes back to the surface...

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.390
That's not good enough!

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.030
I'm being naïve!

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.840
If he returns to the surface,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000
and tells the others that Flutter's dead,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.820
I'll be able to move around freely!

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.340
Am I an idiot?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:40.000
If I allow an enemy to return to the surface,
I'm putting everyone else in more danger.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.160
This one's tough.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.270
I can't let him go back up...

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.280
If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.240
Yes, this way!

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.300
I'm gonna trap you.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.990
A little farther...

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.310
Wait until he's a little farther from it...

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.330
Now!

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.080
So there was someone besides Flutter...

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.100
Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.110
Too bad for you.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:59.910
If only one path remains, it's too good
to be true. Anyone would be suspicious.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.120
Well, now I know about you.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.880
And I bet you're hiding in the
monitor room to watch me, chicken!

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.520
Damn...

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.250
I could have completely
trapped him in that hallway...

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.390
But there's no way out from where he is now.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.400
He's still trapped.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.250
Sleeping gas will eventually
fill the room, and he'll...

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.340
Crap! He isn't trapped!

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.650
There's a way out!

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.630
I should get out of here...

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.110
That's probably sleeping gas.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.780
I have to do something before he realizes.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.900
I know...

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.810
The armored vehicles in the garage.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.200
With those, I could at least lock him in.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.780
But then I'll have no way to get
back to the surface, either!

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.430
Think...

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.680
Is there anything I can use here?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.180
Come up with the best possible plan, fast!

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.610
I guess I have to blow through this shutter...

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.440
How annoying!

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.630
I have to do this!

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.300
Damn! All that firing, and I
barely scorched the surface?

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.780
Guess I'll need to think of something else...

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.280
I know!

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.210
You can operate the shutters
from the monitor room,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.210
Monitor Room

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.810
so I can go there to open the shutters.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.330
Nice idea!

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.470
Wait,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.440
I have to go through the shutters
to reach the monitor room.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.250
Damn, so I have to get through these
shutters to return to the surface?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.480
Wait...

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.990
There might be a way

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.810
to escape without busting down the shutters.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.800
The shutter's opening?

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.310
An armored vehicle?

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.010
That's something a chicken would use.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.150
But the shutter behind it is still shut.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.130
The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.910
Which means that...

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.520
First,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.220
he closed the front shutter and
parked the vehicle there.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.950
Then he returned to the monitor room,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.530
and started raising the front shutter

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:51.290
and lowering the back one,
before racing back to the vehicle?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.690
Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.270
He closed off his only escape
route, just to finish me off?

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.940
Heh... Yeah, right.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.700
So there's more than one...

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.930
The other's watching in the monitor room.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.390
Pisses me off!

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.060
Watch this, you peeping tom...

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.820
I'm gonna drag your buddy
out of the armored vehicle

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.320
and rip him to shreds!

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.040
I'm the only one here.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.670
I have to do something...

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.080
By myself!

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.340
That's tough armor!

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.600
I did it!

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.930
Crap! He blocked the elevator!

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.100
I could have blown a hole in the
ceiling, and climbed up the wire!

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.590
I've blocked his escape route.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.570
First hurdle cleared!

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.130
You have guts to show yourself...

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.300
I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.150
Smoke?

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.150
Did he kill himself?

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.690
Miss his chance to escape?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.520
Either way, there's no way to move this thing!

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.800
There's only a few centimeters of space.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.130
The elevator's completely blocked!

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.680
Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.680
If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.950
Open the damned shutter!

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.870
You hear me?

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.600
Being an octopus, I only need a few
centimeters to squeeze through.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.320
Second hurdle cleared.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.200
Hey!

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.160
Open the shutter!

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.610
Now, I just have to wait for the
sleeping gas to fill the room.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.850
I can hold my breath,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.840
but I don't want to waste time.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.200
Wait for the right timing!

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.830
Third hurdle cleared.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.300
Be patient.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.320
Nice and slow.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.390
This is the final hurdle.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.020
I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.870
Fire! This is the best option!

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.870
I'll be safest if I control his body
and return to the surface!

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.880
Which means I have to kill him...

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.880
I'm the only one here.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.380
There's no one else to help me!

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.590
I h-have to...

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.250
kill him!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.200
I can't do it!

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.460
I'm...

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.590
I'm...

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.340
just a coward!

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.480
While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:20.500
Within the shifted central tower,
as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.580
he was battling doubts of his own, as well.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.430
Hold on.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.080
What if...

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.190
Pitou! Pouf!

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.160
Are you there?

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.300
Hey!

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.330
What if it isn't that he chose
not to respond to Youpi,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.360
but that he wasn't able to respond?

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.770
Within the cocoon should be
nothing but a goopy mess.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.420
He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:57.430
If he's utterly defenseless
while he changes forms,

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.790
this is the time to attack.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:08.270
Would he really make such a literally
fatal mistake in this situation?

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.530
It's not possible!

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.420
This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.380
But the question is whether the
trap activates when I attack,

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.390
or if it's already been activated,
before I've even attacked.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.750
Which is it?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.400
You have doubts because you
are good at what you do.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.970
However, that is all there is to it.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.510
Attack? Don't attack?

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.380
What do I do?

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.840
Next time: Fake x And x Real.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.320
Hey... If not now, when?

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.920
Not yet!

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.060
You're a fake. You aren't Killua.
