WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Three days remain until the selection begins.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.080
In the palace, the King has
completed his recovery,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.860
and continues to play Gungi without rest.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.120
That's checkmate.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.380
Her mind and body are at their limit.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.900
I estimate it will only take another
match or two before the King wins.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.010
Gungi x Of x Komugi

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.510
Time for a break.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.220
We will resume in a half day.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.580
Wait, I can keep going!

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.170
If you can barely sit straight,
the victory won't satisfy me.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.050
Recover your strength.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.000
Even while his arm was being treated,
the King never stopped playing.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.670
But now he changes his mind?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.260
This female is dangerous.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.260
If this continues,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.700
she could prove quite troublesome...

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.780
Then, I will excuse myself.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.420
I must not be too hasty.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.450
The King chose to retract his decree.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.230
In order to stay true to his convictions...

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.570
In order to defeat the Gungi
Champion at her best...

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.430
In order to demonstrate his strength!

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.700
If I kill this girl now,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.660
the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.640
Her death will cement her status

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.370
as someone the King could never defeat!

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.350
I am such a fool!

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.320
My hasty impulse could have left
the King with a permanent scar!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.380
I shall die of my own volition!

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.520
Once I have seen the King conquer the world...

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.340
Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex,
seven people will infiltrate the palace.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.480
Shoot and me...

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.180
Gon, Killua,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.220
Meleoron, Ikalgo,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.340
and then Morel.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.590
A few seconds after us,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.170
the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's <i>En</i>.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.300
During that time, we must draw
the Royal Guard from the King.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.680
Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.170
When we suddenly appear
in the midst of the palace,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.520
their immediate reaction will be...

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.290
To protect the King with their lives.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.790
They'll probably use a formation like this.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.940
Breaking it won't be easy.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.950
And that's where I come in.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.330
Okay, any questions?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.850
Uh, about Palm...

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.440
Can we do anything to learn
what's happened to her?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.650
She's either dead or in hiding.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.200
If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.240
Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.070
If she were captured,
she'd have taken her own life.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.160
When she left, she was prepared for that.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.290
If we try to check in on her,
it would be an insult to her resolve.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.260
Hey, you're being too harsh!

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.880
Gon's just concerned about Palm.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.380
And his concern is worthless.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.300
What's that?!

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.180
You just came back! Where do you get off?!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.840
Assuming that Palm was captured alive,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.190
it would mean the enemy knows our plan.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.410
Which would make us like moths
flying straight into the flame.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.200
We'll be destroyed instantly.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.290
But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.560
what's important is that we trust Palm.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.330
Well, that certainly makes sense,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.380
but Gon's point might be that,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.840
if Palm has met such a fate, we still
have time to change the plan.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.840
Think again.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.790
He'll say that we have to save Palm first.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.970
But he won't offer any plans for that.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.930
Right?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.510
R-Right...

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.210
I see your point...

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.160
I know you're worried,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.230
but once the operation starts,
you'll have to forget her until we're done.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.650
If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.240
that might cause our operation to fail.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.500
We still have two days...

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.670
There's still time for Palm to contact us.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.260
<i>Nyow</i> I understand.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.880
Should I have tried to escape to the right?

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.020
You should have moved your knight.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.680
I didn't want to let a single piece
control the center of the board.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.320
Sometimes, you must accept
the risk and move forward.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.080
Otherwise, you won't ever be
able to make me hesitate.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.210
I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.210
Your Majesty...

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.240
What is it?

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.220
I have some sensitive information,
so we should step outside.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.970
It's fine, speak.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.290
Two days remain until the National Celebration.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.740
The number of citizens to process in Peijing
has increased beyond our expectations.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.950
But the weather forecast is favorable,
so the selection should proceed as planned.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.990
Get to the point.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.530
I would like to move up

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.400
the post-selection schedule.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.380
That's it? Do as you wish.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.750
Yes, sir.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.870
In that case, we will depart
immediately after the selection—

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.390
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.970
I'm telling you to decide on your own.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.810
Do not return until I summon you.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.390
So you were chased out, too?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.140
Well, we only need to wait for the King to win.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.340
You think that will only be a
few more matches, right?

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.350
No.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.190
Wasn't that what you said a while ago?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.070
The King is improving at a remarkable rate.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.690
However, she is also evolving.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.910
I am no longer able to predict the outcome.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.800
Well, it's still only a matter of
time before the King wins.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.880
I hope you're right.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.190
I am. There's nothing to worry about.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.060
I am one hundred percent confident
that he's acting on his own...

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.320
The man who defeated Leol.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.180
The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.240
The soldiers under his control
are all smoke puppets.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.450
Since their complex movements
are not typical of </i>Nen<i> puppets,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.970
they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.450
He can't control as many puppets as I can,
but his are more responsive.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.210
I want to fight him...

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.720
But I can't leave my post.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.550
Maybe he'll come to me...

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.130
It's about time for us to enter Peijing.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.830
The enemy should have noticed
Morel's distraction by now.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.250
We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.030
their belief that this is all the work of one man.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.000
At the same time,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.480
many citizens will be moving toward the palace.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.540
If we disappear the day before the celebration,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.630
they'll believe assassins are hidden
among the citizens, trying to kill the King.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.050
And their focus will be outside
the palace, on the crowds.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.810
That's when we enter the palace with
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.600
The King will definitely be here.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.780
Watching the selection from
the third-floor throne room.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.240
Will he really be there?

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.990
Something...

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.780
feels off.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.260
2-1-3, pawn.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.010
4-5-1, knight.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.770
8-7-2, lieutenant general.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.770
4-3-3, archer.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.540
She continues to attack where
I'm weak without hesitation.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.150
As we play, she's getting sharper.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.850
2-1-1, knight.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.600
6-6-1, major general.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.370
But it does not pain me.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.880
Rather, I find this enjoyable.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.500
Because the board dictates my every move.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.050
Which proves that she is still
several levels above me.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.560
How strong can she become?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.190
Supreme Leader...

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.190
I feel...

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.190
strange.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.540
I can't stop.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.850
Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.100
I can become even better!

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.590
Has she awakened?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.590
Then she's only

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.250
begun to grow.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.530
That's checkmate.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.110
Could I take a short break?

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.430
It's the first time she's asked for a break...

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.800
Is something wrong?

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:29.130
No, I'd like to return to my room to
record the moves that are in my mind.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.320
But you can't see...

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.380
Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.820
When I touch the pieces after they're placed,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.010
I will never forget their position.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.890
She's memorized every placement
she's ever experienced?

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.680
Very well, you're excused.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.570
Thank you.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.530
A foolish question...

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.650
Her name...

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.950
Hey.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.650
What is your name?

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.470
You mean mine?

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.410
Is there anyone else around?

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.790
It's K-K-Komugi.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.770
Komugi?

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.920
Supreme Leader...

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.170
Can you please tell me

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.300
what your name is?

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.300
My name?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.550
What...

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.850
am I called?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.940
Pitou.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.820
Yes, what do you need?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.570
Pouf.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.340
Yes.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.210
Youpi.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.690
Yes.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.030
Is something the matter?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.590
Pouf...

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.330
Yes?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.830
Right, you're Pouf.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.750
Then...

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.260
What is my name?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.260
I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty...

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.730
You are the King. You have no other name.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.250
You are the one and only King.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.100
At the moment, there are impostors
using that name without permission,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.520
but we will eliminate them all.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.280
So that the entire world will
know there is only one King.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.790
That assumes the others can be eliminated.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.790
"King" is a title.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.800
A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.250
What of you, Youpi?

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.840
Your question is far beyond my capacity.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.630
I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.910
Pitou.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.100
I believe that your feelings
are what matter most.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.100
You should select the name
that you find most pleasing.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.230
Very well, then.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.080
You can choose a name after the selection.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:14.710
Right now, our priority is to finish all the
preparations before tomorrow morning.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.750
Your Majesty, is something wrong?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.140
If you have any concerns, we shall address them.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.240
That is why we are here.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.730
Komugi's entire body was glowing.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.010
Komugi?

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.640
The girl with the closed eyes.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.860
He's remembered that human's name.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.150
She experienced an awakening.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.000
Komugi will now become much stronger,
although only at Gungi.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.290
Pitou...

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.230
Yes.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.720
If Komugi were put through the selection

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.890
that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.360
She would die.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.410
The selection chooses humans

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.290
with the physical and mental
strength to serve as soldiers.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.350
The survivors will be those who demonstrate
excellent combat capabilities.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.680
Your Majesty, please...

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.570
After meeting Komugi,

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.730
I've learned that strength can
manifest in different ways.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.440
For example, during our trip here...

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.820
Your Majesty, please stop.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.840
...I killed a child.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.950
Your Majesty, you must not say it...

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.410
Perhaps that child...

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.660
It isn't right... It's inappropriate!

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.120
...had the potential to surpass
me in a certain field.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.620
An almighty King...

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.790
Yet I extinguished that potential.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.920
...can never show regret!

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.560
I extinguished it for no real reason.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.550
You must not say any more!

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.300
I am...

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.770
King!

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.450
I took a life for no reason at all...

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.400
What tremendous strength I must possess!

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.520
I appear with no warning, to rob
countless beings of their inferior strength!

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.290
To crush... To destroy.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.710
That is my power.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.070
Brute force is the strongest
power in this world!

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.200
I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.990
Why not?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.670
I jumped to the wrong conclusion,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.200
and I nearly insulted the King.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.540
I was foolish enough to think that the King
might have regretted his actions...

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.840
You always think too much.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.330
Yes, that is correct.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.890
Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.140
Yes, that is true.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.770
If the girl will impede the King,
we should kill her.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.650
To think my mind operates
on the same level as yours...

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.400
Yes...

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.410
My power is the strongest that exists.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.790
All other power means nothing
in the face of my own.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.380
They are as dust in the wind.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.590
Komugi... That female is no different.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.210
Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.180
I could turn her into no more than
a source of meat with the barest touch.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.800
So her life depends on my mood.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.810
If I change my mind,

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.510
I can immediately kill her!

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.820
Then why am I so hesitant?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.320
The goal was to kill time while
waiting for the selection.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.820
The selection is tomorrow...
Haven't I had enough?

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.850
I've had my fun. I no longer need her.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.200
Do I kill her now?!

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.680
Th-Thank you very much...

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.850
Why did you not call for help?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.120
Here...

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.560
And here...

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.940
You're covered in blood!

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.690
Damn, I don't believe it.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.820
She's such a fragile creature!

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.920
Because it's still early...

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.450
I don't want to bother anyone else.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.450
You aren't bothering anyone.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.460
What am...

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.840
You are an important guest!

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.460
...I saying?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.760
Didn't I come here to kill her?

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.880
Why do you cry?!

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.070
Why can't I do it?

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.080
I'm sorry!

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.840
But... But...

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.230
No one's ever been this nice to me!

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.460
What is this creature?

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.240
What do I want

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.730
to do with her?

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.430
Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.790
Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas
keep flooding into my mind—

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.300
Then we're covered for future preview segments!
