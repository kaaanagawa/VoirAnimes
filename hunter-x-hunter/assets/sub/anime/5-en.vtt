WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.210
I see, I see...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.540
That settles it...

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.560
You're the real one.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.090
Examiners are Hunters

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.900
selected by the committee to perform
this duty without pay.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.910
Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.160
would have been able to block that attack.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000
I shall take that as a compliment.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.690
However, should you attack me again,
for any reason,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.210
I will report you for turning
on an examiner.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.730
And you will be immediately disqualified.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.050
Are we clear?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.510
Sure.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.810
Hisoka x Is x Sneaky

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.800
The 368 applicants who made it through
the long underground tunnel

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.220
find themselves in an unexplored land
teeming with strange creatures,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.550
known as the Numere Wetlands.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.440
Pay attention now.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.840
Be sure to stay close behind me.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.260
The fog is getting thicker.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.210
All right...

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.360
This is our chance.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.220
We'll take advantage of the fog
to get rid of him!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.530
Gon...

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.700
Huh?

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.410
Let's move up.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.450
Okay.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.500
We don't want to lose sight
of the examiner.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.870
I'm more concerned with

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.790
increasing the distance between
us and Hisoka.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.660
Staying too close to him is dangerous.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.950
I can smell it in the air.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.380
Smell?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.430
Hmm...

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.420
I don't think he smells.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.150
Leorio! Kurapika!

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.520
Killua says that we should move up!

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.350
Hey...

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.680
Can't you feel the tension
surrounding us?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.170
Moron!

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.810
If I had the strength,
I'd already be there!

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.560
Don't worry about us!

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.570
What?

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.260
Let's go, Gon.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.430
Ah, wait!

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.810
We can't even tell
which way we're going.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.710
It's okay.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.340
As long as we don't lose sight
of the guys ahead of us...

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.840
What's going on?

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.980
Wh-What?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.360
Noggin Luggin' Tortoise

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.510
This looks bad...

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.730
Claymore Mushrooms

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.620
Huh? What?

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.660
A butterfly?

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.890
Hypnosis Butterfly

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.450
Damn!

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.480
Which way are we supposed to go?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.370
Did we lose sight of him?

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.900
Pay attention now.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.530
Be sure to stay close behind me.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.910
Over there!

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.620
Pay attention now.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.430
Caw!

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.780
Be sure to stay close behind me.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.060
Ruse Raven

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.060
Caw!

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.330
That thing can imitate human speech?

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.930
Close call...

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.320
Yeah...

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.320
I hear people screaming all around us.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.790
Just stay on your guard.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.830
I wonder if Leorio and
Kurapika are okay...

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.800
Mm?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.340
Frog-in-Waiting

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.650
Leorio!

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.850
Ouch.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.550
Leorio, here's our opportunity.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.300
Y-Yeah...

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.000
Guess he didn't like the taste of us.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.080
It was this.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.700
That was from Tonpa-san!

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.020
Guess he saved us.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.350
Well, I could have escaped.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.670
I'm still worried about Leorio and Kurapika.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.130
Forget about them. Let's get a move on.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.220
We can still catch up to the examiner.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.310
We've lost sight of the front-runners.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.980
Which way should we go?

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.990
Stop!

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.150
Over there...

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.130
When I saw you last year,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.390
I knew you weren't Hunter material.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.010
We'll spare you if you swear not to
take the Hunter Exam again.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.840
Sure.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.690
Huh?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.170
I'm passing the exam this year,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.630
so I won't need to retake it.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.690
Passing?

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.650
Idiot!

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.220
Look at this fog.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.250
It's impossible to determine which
direction the main pack went!

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.650
Meaning we've all failed the exam!

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.170
So that's why.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.030
Having already failed, you wish
to play examiner.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.700
Hunters require prey.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.910
Why don't I play examiner...

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.050
And judge whether you
are Hunter material?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800
Shut up!

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.080
Now, then...

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.520
H-H-Help!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.260
Hel—

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.730
Well?

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.070
Care to participate,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.070
in my little game of examiner?

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:14.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.170
Satotz

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.090
Cool...

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.810
We've caught up to the
main group, Gon.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.400
Huh?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.550
Where'd he go?

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.170
Leorio.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.380
On my signal, we run in
opposite directions.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.440
What?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.620
He is vastly more experienced
in real combat.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.100
The two of us won't stand a
chance against him.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.740
We cannot afford to squander time
in a pointless fight!

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.250
Now!

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.160
I see...

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.350
A wise decision.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.280
Hmm?

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.290
I just can't do it...

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.300
This may not be my fight,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.180
but I won't close my eyes

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.920
and make a break for it!

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.680
Leorio?!

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.680
Mm, I adore that look on your face.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.730
What?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.800
Gon?

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.420
I made it in time...

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.770
Not bad, little boy.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.610
Is that a fishing pole?

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.720
What a fascinating weapon.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.030
Allow me a closer look.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.660
Your fight is with

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.250
me!

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.550
You came to rescue your friend?

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.770
Such a good boy.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.390
And that expression...

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.880
Nice...

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.320
Very nice.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.400
I'm getting excited now...

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.410
Okay!

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.860
How wonderful...

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.990
I really do love that look.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.110
Do not fear.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.420
I will not kill your friend.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.930
He passed.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.220
Yes, you pass, as well.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.690
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.970
Hisoka, you should get back here.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.450
We're nearly at the Phase Two site.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.660
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.010
It's always good to have friends.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.960
You can find your own way back, yes?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.880
That's a good boy.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.320
Gon!

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.260
Are you all right?

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.600
Huh?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.480
Gon isn't here...

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.650
This way.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.010
You can really tell?

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.160
Uh-huh.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.610
Leorio's cologne is very unique.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.580
I can smell him from a
few kilometers away.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.710
Say, Kurapika...

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.720
What did Hisoka mean when
he said that we passed?

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.820
Hisoka was acting as a judge.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.120
A judge?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.060
Yes.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.100
He must have his own benchmarks
for evaluating power.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.400
It's possible that he was ascertaining
each applicant's strength.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.230
Apparently, you and Leorio must
have met his standards.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.520
I see.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.160
But I was powerless to do
anything against him.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.370
Didn't you land your first hit on him?

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.540
Only because I surprised him.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.130
Besides, Leorio passed,
even though he lost...

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.370
Hmm...

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.640
Perhaps he sensed that you
were kindred spirits.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.390
Kindred spirits?

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:09.060
I seriously doubt that Hisoka
could qualify as a Hunter.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.110
However,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.730
I must admit that he did impress me

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.110
with his superhuman agility
and graceful technique.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.160
It's quite common that those

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.770
possessing special talents are drawn
to others with unique gifts.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.100
Most likely, Hisoka's instincts
and experience

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.590
told him that you had the skill and
potential to become Hunters.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.590
Killing you now would have been a waste...

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.130
That was his perspective.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.090
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.970
Was that insensitive on my part?

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.390
No...

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.060
But I was pretty excited, as well.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.490
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.320
But I couldn't.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.900
And at the same time, I was excited.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.320
Isn't that strange?

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.310
For the first time in his life,
Gon has experienced mortal fear.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.710
Though the unfamiliar feelings
accompanying that fear confuse Gon,

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:39.820
he cannot restrain his growing curiosity.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.420
At this stage, 220 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.580
leaving 148 remaining applicants.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.960
Next time: A x Surprising x Challenge!

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.120
S-Surprisingly challenging.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.850
Huh?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.300
Gon, are you okay?
