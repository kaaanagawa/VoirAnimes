WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.530
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.160
One more!

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190
You just used your right hand!

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.010
I did it!

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.940
Hooray...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Decision x By x Majority?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.880
Dawn breaks,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.050
as the airship carrying Gon and his friends

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.000
approaches its destination.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.380
The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam
is about to begin.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.270
I apologize for the long wait.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.280
The airship will soon arrive
at its destination.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.030
Wow!

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.880
Is that where the next test will be held?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.050
What is this place?

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.540
There's nothing here.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.040
Ahem...

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.790
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.410
at the top of Trick Tower.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.050
Trick Tower?

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.680
To pass this phase,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.530
you must reach the tower's base alive.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.560
The time limit is seventy-two hours.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.310
With that, we will now begin
the Third Phase.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.090
I will pray for your success.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.670
No way.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.280
So it's finally my turn?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.800
Best of luck to everyone!

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.030
Are we supposed to climb down?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.160
That would be suicide...

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.430
Maybe for a normal person.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.130
But a top-class rock climber can
handle this, no problem.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.220
Wow...

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.690
He's going down pretty fast.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.680
Looks like I'll be the first one
to pass the Third Phase...

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.920
Stop! Stay away!

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.500
Stop! Stop it!

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.230
Help!

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.320
G-Guess we can't climb down the side...

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.510
Yeah.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.250
What's up?

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.980
There are fewer people around.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.000
What?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.430
I count twenty-three,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.730
which suggests almost half of the
applicants have already found an exit.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.510
No way. When did they do that?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.660
That means there must be

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.580
some hidden doors that lead below.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.300
Kurapika! Leorio!

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.320
What is it, Gon?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.280
Look. I found a hidden door.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.490
I see now.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.800
So we can descend by flipping the stones.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800
Okay!

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.950
Great job, Gon!

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.540
Let's head on down!

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.000
But I'm confused.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.290
About what?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.710
There are also hidden doors here,
there, over there,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.670
and over there, as well.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.160
That many?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.180
Five hidden doors,
located in the same area.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.100
It sounds suspicious to me.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.310
Some could be traps.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.990
And it looks as though

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.670
each door can only be used once...

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.060
Seriously?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.240
We tried opening a door
someone else used,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.720
but it wouldn't budge.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.080
Judging by the door's size,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.810
only one can fit at a time.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.220
In other words, only one person
can use each door.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.580
We'll have to split up.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.740
Gon and I decided that we're each
going to choose a door.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.970
No hard feelings if one
of us springs a trap!

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.090
What are you guys gonna do?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.310
I can live with that.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.720
Luck is part of the game...

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.500
I have no objection.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.100
Then that settles it.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.670
Let's go, on the count of three.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.610
I guess this is goodbye for now.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.860
We'll meet up again, at the tower's base.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.430
Let's go...

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.490
One!

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.740
Two!

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.740
Three!

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.290
Huh?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.180
Huh? What?

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.940
That was quite a brief farewell.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.150
Oh,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.570
so all the doors led to the same room...

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.320
"The five of you

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.070
must follow the will of the majority
to reach the goal."

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.400
Five of us?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.330
Look... There are five stopwatches.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
There's an O and an X button.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.590
Could it be that we won't be
able to leave this room

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.580
until another person drops in?

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.860
That is correct!

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.720
Who's that?!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.040
My name is Lippo.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.550
I am the prison warden here,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.180
as well as the Third Phase examiner.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.060
Prison warden?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.560
Multiple routes through this tower
have been prepared.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.940
You have chosen the path
of majority rule.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.680
Cooperation will be key

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.450
if you wish to clear this
phase of the exam.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.920
One person's selfish behavior
can derail an entire group.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.800
And you can't start until you
have five members.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.830
Best of luck, gentlemen!

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.070
We can't move on until
someone else arrives?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.570
What do we do?

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.130
We have to wait, I guess...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.070
Did you need something, warden?

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.260
The test begins now.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.570
Take your assigned positions.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.560
Okay.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.040
Oh, come on!

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.960
It's been two hours...

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.970
What if the others all took
different routes?

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.720
Only a fool would still be at
the top of the tower!

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.510
Calm down, Leorio.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.970
Complaining won't help.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.080
But...

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.480
What if no one shows up before
we reach our time limit?

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.710
Hey!

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.640
I can't just sit here and...

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.070
Quiet!

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.020
Huh?

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.990
That sound...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.750
Good grief...

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.360
Tonpa-san.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.770
Oh.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.460
It's the old man.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.850
Okay!

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.610
I see.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.850
So the door appears

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.030
once five people arrive and
put on the stopwatches.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.530
"At this door, select
O to open, X not to open."

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.970
Forcing us to use majority rule already?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.540
The answer should be obvious...

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.790
What?

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.250
Who pushed the X button?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.000
Sorry, that was me.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.550
I pressed the wrong button
by mistake.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.640
Stop screwing around, old man!

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.680
Are you blind?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.900
Like I said, it was an accident.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.870
How can you accidentally press
the wrong button?!

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.010
It doesn't matter.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.980
The door opened.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.600
No, it does matter!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.820
This guy deliberately pressed
the wrong button...

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.680
Let's go.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.510
We don't have time to bicker.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.000
That's right...

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.180
Even if he keeps pressing
the wrong one,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.870
the rest of us just need to
press the right one.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.610
Fine.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.390
Okay, let's go!

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.440
Damn...

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.010
Seriously...

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.840
Another question so soon?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.600
"Which way do you want to go?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.340
O for right. X for left."

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.640
Right...

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.100
Or left...

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.100
Huh?!

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.700
Wh-Why would you choose to go right?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.860
Normally, you should go left...

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.260
That is true.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.030
Studies have indicated that people
who are lost or stuck at forks

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.240
unconsciously tend to go left.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.620
I've heard that before, too.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.200
Wait! The numbers don't add up!

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.380
Which button did you press?

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.300
Right.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.480
Right.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.380
Y-You guys...

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.740
That's why they chose to go right...

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.270
To outfox the examiner.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.170
If the examiner knows that
people tend to go left,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.890
the left path will be more difficult.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.900
So we're just simple-minded!

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.000
We?

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.180
Wh-What is this place?

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.670
Look over there.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.980
The applicants have arrived.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.930
Remove the shackles.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.740
Jeez...

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.220
I'm finally free.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:37.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.170
Tonpa

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.430
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.680
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.180
Prisoners?

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.330
The Hunter Exam Committee

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.140
has also officially hired them
as examiners.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.890
You will be fighting against
the five of them.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.470
The fights will be one-on-one.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.850
Each person may only fight once.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.410
You are free to use any method you like.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.080
There will be no draws.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.020
A win is declared when the
opponent admits defeat.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.970
You may pick your order.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.960
It's majority rule.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.470
So secure three wins, and you may pass.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.030
The rules are simple.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.770
Tsk...

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.820
Majority rule again?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.480
Well, I prefer straightforward rules.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.230
However, the actual fights will
not be quite so simple.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.230
The prisoners' sentences will be reduced

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.420
by one year, for every hour they
delay the applicants here.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.250
In other words, their goal
is also to buy time.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.500
I understand...

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.250
And we must reach the goal
within seventy-two hours.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.270
So time will be critical during these fights.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.300
Okay, I'm up first.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.760
Bendot
199-year sentence, robbery and murder

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.760
Choose your combatant!

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.250
What should we do?

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.420
He said that we can fight
with any method.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.020
So that means anything goes.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.270
We don't know what they'll try to pull...

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.650
There's too much at stake without knowing

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.750
what they have up their sleeves.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.900
Given that, I shall...

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.400
No, I'll go!

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.340
Tonpa-san?

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.650
I'll act as a guinea pig,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.240
so we can discover what they're up to.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.410
Consider this an apology for before.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.790
Hey, are you serious?

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.850
Sure.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.300
Plus, you guys don't actually
trust me, right?

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:50.730
Do you really want me to be the tiebreaker,
when the score is 2-2?

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.930
You have a point...

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.430
Then it's settled.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.190
Tonpa, you're...

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.300
Th-That was a surprise...

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.490
I didn't expect Tonpa to volunteer.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.720
He called himself a guinea pig.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.510
Will Tonpa-san be okay?

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.980
Now, let us determine the
method of combat.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.230
I propose a death match.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.660
A death match?

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.310
They fight until one dies?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.490
No...

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.010
Don't let him provoke you!

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.240
Well?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.940
Very well...

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.250
I accept!

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.330
Huh?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.750
Seriously?

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.500
I commend you for your courage!

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.690
T-Tonpa...

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.910
Let the fight begin!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.340
I...

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.840
I give!

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.700
Huh?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.690
What?

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.750
Did he just give up?

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.150
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.440
What did you just say?

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.060
You win if I admit defeat, right?

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.990
I give up...

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.300
I lose!

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.450
Wha... Wha... Wha...

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.310
All right...

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.710
I win this round.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.220
If we win two more rounds, you lose.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.680
You won't be able to advance or turn back.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.240
You'll be stuck here until the
seventy-two hours are up.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.510
Should that come to pass,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.230
our sentences will be reduced
by seventy-two years.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.420
Man, that was a disgrace.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.240
He looked a lot stronger up close...

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.490
Bastard...

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.740
You just confirmed all my suspicions!

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.080
You're a worthless piece of trash,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.250
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.040
Exactly.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.260
That's what I do every year.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.390
And I plan to continue the tradition.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.010
Wh-What?

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.470
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.010
I'm only in it for the thrills.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.880
The thrills?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.020
Yes.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.920
The Hunter Exam is a trial meant

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.530
to crush confident young people's dreams.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.690
The moment of despair,
when ambition and hope give way,

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.660
gives me a sense of exquisite pleasure.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:45.250
Especially when I'm actively
shattering these rookies' dreams.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.050
I don't plan on becoming a Hunter.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.130
I've already had enough fun this year.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.880
It's time for me to bow out.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.280
You bastard...

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.390
Stop, Leorio!

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.490
But...

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.140
They want us to waste our time,
fighting amongst ourselves.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.150
However,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.350
if their goal is to buy time,

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.260
then the old man made
the correct choice.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.400
Huh?

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.370
That bald guy is probably

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.910
a former soldier or mercenary.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.580
Had you fought him,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.890
he would have started by
crushing your throat,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.410
so you couldn't have given up.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.760
Then he would have tortured you,
without killing you,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.960
for the rest of the remaining time...

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.810
Th-That was one of the possibilities
I took into consideration...

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.180
You look sick.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.210
My plan was disrupted.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.910
I was going to take my time,
punishing him...

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.140
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.670
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.850
If we defeat two of the remaining four,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.390
then we win.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:03.620
Regardless, we need to win
three rounds and advance.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.200
Who's going next?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.950
Me! I'll go!

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.930
Are you sure?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.210
Uh-huh!

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.210
The next opponent doesn't
look too strong.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.840
But you can't let your guard down.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.940
He's still a criminal.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.660
Uh-huh, I know.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.260
Tonpa's actions

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.540
have placed Gon and his friends
at a disadvantage.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.460
What is their next opponent,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.740
Sedokan, planning to do in this match?

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.330
At the start of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.170
there were 40 applicants.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.540
With 1 eliminated,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.210
only 39 remain.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.590
Next time: Beware x Of x Prisoners.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.560
And watch your back!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.290
Be careful when you're out late.
