WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But you know...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.700
After you said we could be friends...

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.740
I couldn't let you die!

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.870
I'm gonna save you!

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.000
Don't die on me!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Power x And x Games

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.970
While Killua was being rescued
by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.120
his supposed enemy,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.990
Gon, too, was forming a bond with
a Chimera Ant called Meleoron.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.850
You should stop smoking.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.760
If the smoke sticks to you,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.280
people can smell you coming, and it'll
waste your ability to become invisible.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.400
I appreciate the warning.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.750
But honestly, that doesn't matter.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.020
While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.890
my real power is on an entirely different level.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.360
Just watch.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.650
Huh?! He vanished in an instant...

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440
I can't sense him at all.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.770
Only the smell of cigarettes.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.600
He's gone...

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.030
This isn't mere invisibility.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880
Does he also have the ability

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.920
to change locations instantly,
without making any sound?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.650
That isn't possible!

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.580
How did he do it?!

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.960
Where'd you come from?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.380
I've been here the entire time.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.550
Huh?

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.200
My second ability is Perfect Plan.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.810
God's Alibi
Perfect Plan

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.570
When I hold my breath,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.810
no one can sense my existence.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.560
You were even touching me...

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.820
But your mind didn't realize it.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.940
Eh? I touched you?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330
You know how some people are easily overlooked?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.490
When you go to a restaurant in a group,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.760
there's always one person that the
waitress forgets to bring water.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.830
This is an extreme version.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.710
I'm right here, but no one notices me.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.840
Oh...

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.920
I use my other ability to turn invisible

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000
to cover this one so no one can learn about it.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.700
For the record, you and I are
the only ones in the world

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440
who know this.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.050
Why tell me something so important?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.540
Well, it's to build trust.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.840
Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.030
If I can't convince you to trust me,
we can't start anything.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.540
You mean, what you said about
me being a valuable partner?

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.300
Yeah, but that's for later.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.580
Like I said, we have to trust each other first.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.550
Once you've agreed to be my
partner, I'll tell you more.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.390
Okay, I'll be your partner.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.970
That was fast!

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.080
You don't know how to bargain, kid.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.180
Don't be so trusting of me!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.150
Suspect everyone!

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.440
Until you've done due diligence,
don't trust anyone!

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.250
Huh?

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.610
I said it's okay, so why are
you being so difficult?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.660
Can you even make this decision on your own?!

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.900
What about your buddy?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.180
He'll have a fit

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.870
when he hears you teamed up with
a suspicious-looking monster...

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.050
And why am I insulting myself?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.240
I didn't choose to be this way!

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.420
He talks a lot...

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.800
Whatever.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.430
Even a friend of twenty years
could stab you in the back.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.170
Time is no measure of trust!

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.180
Say, "Ho"!

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.320
You're no fun...

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.250
We can never be friends.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.940
I feel the same way...

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.390
Then, are you sure about this?

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.350
About what?

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.190
About teaming up with me.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.280
Won't your buddy object?

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.570
Most likely.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.790
Because he tends to be cautious
and to question everything.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.790
This won't work, then.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.870
The deal's dead in the water.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.580
But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.980
Killua won't like it, but he'll give in.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.380
Really... He must have a hard time.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.780
Well, whatever.
If you say it's okay, I'll trust you.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.360
So let's get to business.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.070
Yeah.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.770
I want to defeat the King.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.800
Want to know why?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.900
Yeah, of course.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.270
That's what I've been waiting for...

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.800
Revenge.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.260
Right now, I can't tell you
why I want revenge...

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.080
Okay.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.240
I'd like to know, but I'll wait.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.690
That's probably what he wants to hear...

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.910
If you're that curious, I'll tell you.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.050
You'll tell me now?!

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.870
Just kidding!

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.680
Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.430
I didn't beg you for anything.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.400
The King killed someone I owed my life to.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.680
His name was Peggy.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.320
I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.830
But at the time, I didn't realize
what had happened.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.860
Huh? Why not?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.780
You saw it happen, didn't you?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.720
Because I'd forgotten that Peggy

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.940
was the one who raised me.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.980
A little while ago, I began to recover my
memories from when I was human.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.580
I haven't remembered everything.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.300
No, I should rephrase that...

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.260
I've only remembered a few things.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.750
The names of my parents, my name,
episodes from my childhood.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.120
Peggy was the name of the
Chimera Ant the King killed.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.110
That was also my foster father's human name.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.970
He was into education, and always
carried thick books around.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.730
In both life and death, he never
parted with his books about NGL.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.730
Then you all have memories
from when you were human?

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.240
I don't know if we're all the same.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.530
Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.340
With others, there's no
telling what they're thinking.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.530
But I think I understand now.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.250
This is why, when we first met,
I was willing to trust you.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.160
You're very human.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.050
More human than any other
Chimera Ant I've met.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.220
In fact, I'd say you're still human.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.800
Really? When I met you,
I had the opposite reaction.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.750
Huh?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.810
I could sense a vicious beast inside you.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.500
That's why I wanted to team up.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.820
There's no limit to what you'll do.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.320
All right... Now, let's get down to business.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.080
But first, could you tell me your name?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.570
I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.790
I actually have one more ability.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.520
And the condition for its
activation has been met.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.220
Time to show you my third power!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.480
Activate!

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.240
It isn't flying away...

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.650
Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.520
Exactly.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.380
This is my third power, God's Accomplice.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.160
While Perfect Plan is active, it allows
anyone I touch to use it, as well.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.990
Do you understand how powerful
this technique is now?

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.680
This power will let us approach
and attack the enemy...

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.170
without their knowledge.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.830
The King's strength doesn't matter...

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.380
If we can sneak up and use a powerful
attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.370
Hey, Gon...

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.020
You're the partner I've been looking for.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.650
The perfect guy to smack the King

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.600
with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.300
I was watching

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.960
when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.130
Those were my soldiers.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.260
I sent them to attack, so I could
measure your strength,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.320
but they...

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.540
Ah, no need to feel bad...

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.480
They were killing for sport when
I wasn't paying attention.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.110
They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.780
Well, from their perspective,
I'm the one who's changed.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.390
What you said about being your partner...

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.120
There's someone who'd be better than me.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.650
You know someone?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.950
Yep.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:10.750
I'll contact him.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.770
Hold on.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.360
I trust you.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.150
And even if you end up turning on me,
I won't blame you or regret my decision.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.950
Because I watched you, spoke to you,
and decided to trust you.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.610
But I'm not about to trust others
just because you trust them.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.020
Do you understand?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.160
I get your point, but...

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.030
My life is on the line here.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.550
Listen to me.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.820
Perfect Plan is not invincible.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.790
In fact, it's highly vulnerable.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.760
I can make people ignore my existence,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.450
but I'm still right there in the same place.
They just don't notice me.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.800
So their attacks can still hit me.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.680
Knowing there's a person around with
my ability, what would someone do?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.160
They'd launch attacks in every direction.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.690
Oh, you're right...

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.730
If one of those attacks hits me,
even by dumb luck, I'm done for.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.130
I hate to admit it,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.700
but when it comes to combat,
I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.710
I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.960
Forget the King...

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.200
I couldn't even survive a punch
from a Squadron Leader.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.640
If I just turn invisible,
others can locate me with <i>En</i>.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.710
It's been tested, so the other
Squadron Leaders know this, too.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.830
I need my enemies to believe
my power to be weak.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.640
They need to think <i>En</i> is enough to beat it.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.390
This ability is only invincible
if no one knows about it.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.000
Enough explaining...

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.010
My point is that I don't want to
reveal my power to any others!

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.110
Not even if it's someone you trust.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.230
You can see for yourself, then.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.160
I'll call him out here without mentioning you.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.750
W-Wait...

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.990
You can watch from a distance.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.380
Hello—

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.350
Yo! I've been waiting, fool!

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.770
You pulled a fast one! Where are you?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.250
I've got lots of questions for you.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.750
Because of you kids, the boss
had to make a move...

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.020
The plan's been derailed,
but I support what you're doing.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.800
Letting five million die isn't right.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.950
The boss used his power to surround the capital.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.170
Really?

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.770
That should make it harder for Neferpitou
to control puppets remotely.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.020
In other words, they can't perform
the selection from a distance.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.040
Right.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.270
But the boss and Knov-san will be expending
all their energy to delay Neferpitou.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.850
Which means, when the operation starts,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.640
they won't be in any condition to
take on any of the Royal Guard.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.210
We expect more citizens to gather
in the capital for the celebration.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.030
There may be a massacre yet.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.540
The situation's still grim...

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.870
We can no longer contact the Chairman.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.250
He's holed up somewhere until the last
possible minute, preparing for the final battle.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.600
We four need to make a decision.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:52.140
Do we summon reinforcements, or do we
face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.460
I'd like to know Killua's opinion.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.470
He isn't here.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.040
What? You split up?

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.440
I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.150
Can you call him real quick?

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.150
No luck. He isn't picking up...

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.290
I think his is off.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.920
Really? Well, keep trying.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.710
We should meet up, the sooner the better.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.570
Yeah.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.690
Let's find a halfway point to meet.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.360
Here... Mandai City.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.470
Okay, got it.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.320
Checkmate.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.390
You're done.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.080
Why didn't you resign?

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.850
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:16.350
The match ended twenty-two moves ago.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.100
Why did you not resign then?

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.480
Did you believe I would make a mistake?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.890
Idiot.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.730
Next, we have the national Go champion.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.550
Give me the rulebook.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.300
It may look simple at first,
but it is a complex game.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.660
It may take more time to learn than shogi.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.470
Please let me leave!

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.700
What do you want?

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.470
Someone! Help me!

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.900
My glasses...

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.990
Silence.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.620
You are in the King's presence.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.180
The choice is yours.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.430
Sit across from me now.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.680
Or die.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.390
5.5 points.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.820
The King wins.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.540
I-It only took him ten games?

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.000
I'm t-tired!

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.680
It's the only explanation for that loss!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.540
And I think I have a fever.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.480
I'm short on sleep.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.460
And I feel dizzy...

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.620
I'll give you eight hours.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.420
And any medicine you need.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.930
I expect you to be in top condition.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.250
Should you lose again, I won't
be interested in excuses.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.140
Rest as if your life depends on it.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.950
I'm impressed by how quickly
you learn these games.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.540
I can't believe it took less than half
the time you spent mastering shogi.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.260
It's all about learning the feel.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.200
Chess, Go, shogi...

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.650
They have different rules, but all three

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.620
have a certain rhythm to their moves.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.170
That means disrupting your
opponent's rhythm is crucial.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.630
Once you've learned the openings,
you can deduce your opponent's rhythm.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.390
Once you know their rhythm,
you need only disrupt it.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.890
A psychological principle that
would apply to any contest.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.220
If you've already reached that conclusion,
I don't see the benefit of playing more games.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.600
I believe they will only bore you.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.950
How many remain?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.110
This country has one more professional game.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.700
It's a board game called Gungi.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.870
Gungi?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.990
The game originated in East Gorteau,

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.130
and nearly all citizens know how to play.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.050
Give me the rulebook.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.900
As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.430
But you can stack up to three pieces.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.770
At the start, you may also freely place
your pieces within your own area.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.080
The game has a different feel

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.780
due to the addition of a third dimension.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.810
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.630
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.790
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.040
Then, if I defeat this champion,
I'll be the best in the world?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.140
A fitting way to end this recreation.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.020
Bring them in.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.560
There are six days until the selection.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.580
The King has no idea

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.580
how this girl is about to influence his fate.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.960
Next time: Check x And x Mate.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.940
I'm Gon.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.000
I'm Gillua.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.290
Did you change your name?

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.370
No way.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.340
Say it again.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.720
I'm Gillua!

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.430
GG!
