00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.240
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.000
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.740
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.130
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580
They are known...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.280
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.020
Departure x And x Friends

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.520 line:20%
Whale Island

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880
Gon's still trying to catch the Lord of the Lake?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.840
Huh?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.520
Y-Yes...

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.220
He's been at it for a week, non-stop.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.700
You promised he could take the Hunter Exam
if he caught the Lord of the Lake?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.510
What a fool!

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.980
Five adults couldn't manage to
reel in that monster.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.550
How is a child supposed to catch that beast?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.230
Mito-san doesn't want him
taking the Hunter Exam.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790
But Gon's old man was the same age
when he caught it...

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.880
He can't do it.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.170
Got him!

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.140
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.170
I got him good!

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.690
It's huge!

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.580
This is the Lord of the Lake?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.070
It's been twenty years!

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.360
I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.050
He's his father's son.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.940
Gon actually caught the Lord!

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.060
Look, Mito-san!

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.630
Mito-san!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.200
I caught the Lord, as promised...

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.240
So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.700
Right?

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.700
I'll do my best.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.710
I promise to become a Hunter!

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.790
It must be in the blood...

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.780
No one has been able to catch the Lord

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.000
after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.980
And now his son has accomplished
the same feat, at the same age.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.010
His eyes have the same shine as his father's.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.940
We can no longer stop him.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.700
Are you sure about this, Gon?

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.720
Uh-huh.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.950
Your father abandoned you
when you were still young

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.730
to become a Hunter.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.950
I know.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.590
He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.940
Isn't that amazing?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.740
Huh?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.480
Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.880
to abandon his own kid!

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.850
It's a dangerous job!

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.880
You never know when you might lose your life!

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.370
Don't you understand?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.860
I don't.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.390
But I want to know more!

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.390
I want to become a Hunter and discover why

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.550
it was so important to my dad!

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.050
You really are Ging's son...

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.460
I promise I'll pass the exam.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.520
I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.520
Just promise that you'll come back safe.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.530
Can you do that?

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.070
Uh-huh, I promise!

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.540
Pinky swear made...

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.520
Whoever breaks their promise has
to swallow a thousand needles.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:52.940
Sealed with a kiss!

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.040
Gon...

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.780
Thank you, Mito-san.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.320
Good luck!

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.740
Knock 'em dead!

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.570
I'm going to become the
best Hunter in the world!

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:49.890
Once I'm the best Hunter
in the world, I'll come back!

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.700
The best Hunter in the world?

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.580
Kid doesn't respect us.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.690
Every year, there are millions of skilled
applicants for the Hunter Exam.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.100
But only a handful are selected.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.210
Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.610
What are you doing, Katsuo?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.620
At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.310
Why are you bent over?

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.890
Hey, losers!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.510
Don't slack off!

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.900
A-Aye, sir!

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.900
Hey...

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.330
Didn't you hear me?

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.540
Move that box!

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.920
A-Aye, Captain!

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.140
Hold on.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.540
Thanks!

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.550
A storm's coming.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.940
How can you tell, boy?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.120
That's what the seagulls are saying.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.230
What?

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.160
Plus...

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.680
It's a huge storm that's coming!

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.680
It's true...

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.190
I can tell by the smell!

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.190
<i>That boy...</i>

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.010
<i>Those eyes...</i>

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.200
<i>Could he be...</i>

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
Captain!

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.040
The mast won't last much longer!

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.540
We should lower the sails!

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.010
Don't be stupid!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.520
The fun's about to start.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.730
Here we go!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.500
Full to port!

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.670
Let's fly!

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:51.990
Hunter Vocabulary

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.990
Gon

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.140
Those waves weren't much...

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.260
Hey, take the helm.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.570
A-Aye!

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.250
Damn, this is one lousy crew.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.420
Not a one of them can stand.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.220
Pathetic.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.160
And they're supposed to be
taking the Hunter Examination.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.560
What a laugh!

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.390
Here are some herbs.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.320
If you chew them, you'll feel a little better.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.670
W-Water...

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.900
It's coming, so hold on.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.400
That boy...

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.420
This is one sour apple...

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.590
<i>I see.</i>

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.190
<i>There are a few tough nuts on board.</i>

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.110
Excuse me!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.330
H-Here is your water!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.930
Thanks.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.310
Now drink your fill.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.790
Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.720
First, tell me your names.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.410
I'm Gon!

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.270
I'm Kurapika.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.830
It's Leorio.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.420
Why do you want to become Hunters?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.080
Hey! If you're not an examiner,
you can't boss us around!

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.600
Just answer the question!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.610
My dad is a Hunter.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.110
I left Whale Island because I want to know

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.480
why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.330
<i>Whale Island...</i>

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.140
<i>So this is Ging's son.</i>

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.930
<i>The day has finally come.</i>

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.140
Hey, kid!

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.860
Huh?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.560
You're not supposed to answer his question!

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.930
Why can't I tell him why I'm here?

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.310
Not a team player, huh?

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.360
I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.770
I agree with Leorio.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.640
What?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.200
Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.110
Show some respect!

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.550
It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.100
by offering a plausible lie.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.020
Hey! Are you listening to me?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.720
However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.990
That said, if I were to tell you the truth,

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:45.300
I would be exposing my deepest secrets.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.230
That is why I cannot provide an answer.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.440
Hey, you... Don't ignore me!

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.420
In other words,
you refuse to answer my question.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.720
Hey, Katsuo.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.810
Aye, Captain.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.820
Tell the examination board that
we have two more dropouts.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.820
What do you mean?

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.050
You still haven't figured it out?

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.320
The Hunter Examination has already begun.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.540
What?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.510
There are as many Hunter wannabes

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.900
as there are stars in the sky.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:28.710
The examiners don't have the time or
resources to review them all.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:34.720
So they hire people like us, to trim the fat.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.560
I've already notified the board

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.090
that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.620
If they couldn't handle a little storm,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.360
they'd stand no chance in the
Hunter Examination's later stages.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:55.430
In other words, you only proceed to
the main exam if I pass you.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.730
So think carefully before you answer my question.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.220
So he says...

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.120
Should have told us sooner.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.890
I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:20.260
Four years ago, my clan was annihilated
by a band of criminals.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.370
I wish to become a Hunter and
hunt down that band,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.900
the Phantom Troupe.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.880
So you want to become a bounty hunter?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.410
The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.640
Not even the most grizzled Hunters
can touch them.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.480
You'd be throwing away your life.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.760
I do not fear death.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.790
I fear only that my rage

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.200
will fade over time.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.810
So, in other words, you want revenge.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.800
Does that require that you become a Hunter?

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.020
That may be the stupidest question
I've ever heard, Leorio.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.540
That's Leorio-san to you!

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.540
Places accessible only to Hunters...

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.010
Information otherwise unobtainable...

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.670
Actions otherwise impossible...

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.200
There are more reasons than your
brain could possibly handle.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.050
Hey!

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.150
Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.000
Me?

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.280
I'll make it short.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.420
I want money.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.830
Money can get you everything!

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.330
A big house!

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.840
A nice car!

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.340
Good liquor!

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.420
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.980
That's three times now.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.210
Step outside.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.330
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.420
Take that back, Leorio!

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.390
Take that back!

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.010
That's Leorio-san to you.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.590
Hey, boys!

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.820
I'm not finished yet!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.930
Just let them go.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.510
Huh?

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.850
Mito-san once told me...

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.740
<i>If you want to get to know someone,</i>

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.750
<i>you need to make an effort</i>

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.060
<i>to learn why they're angry.</i>

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.900
It's important for them to
understand why they're mad.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.390
So we should let them settle it themselves.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.220
Captain!

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.270
L-Look...

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.670
If we get caught by that waterspout,
the ship will sink.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.420
Lower the sails now.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.070
Aye!

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.430
I'll help!

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.170
Uh-huh, come with me.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.990
I'll take the helm.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.660
Aye!

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.160
Full to starboard!

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.230
Hurry!

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.190
The waterspout is gonna catch us!

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.620
Take back what you said!

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.690
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.210
How many times must I repeat myself?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.940
You should show me some respect.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.330
I won't back down.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.050
Then I have no choice...

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.320
Katsuo-san!

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.230
Damn it!

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.810
Pull 'em out! Now...

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.140
You idiot!

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.980
If we hadn't grabbed your legs,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.670
you'd be shark bait now.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.120
Honestly...

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.030
How reckless can you be?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.180
But you did catch me.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.070
Huh?

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.910
You both caught me!

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.750
Well, I guess so...

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.200
Gon!

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.230
Katsuo-san!

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.660
Thanks, Gon!

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.440
You saved my life.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.610
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.930
These two helped save you.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.830
Huh?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.200
Thank you very much!

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.070
No, you don't need to thank me.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.140
Well...

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.070
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.370
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.080
What?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.060
I apologize for my rude behavior.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.090
Sorry, Leorio-san.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.130
Wh-What's with the sudden change?

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.620
We sound like strangers...

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.100
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.500
I'm also sorry.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.420
I take back everything I said.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.340
I was wrong.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.430
No, it's okay.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.250
I like you guys!

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.750
Okay!

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.630
I'll take responsibility for bringing

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.550
you three to the port closest to the exam site.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.490
Really?

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.780
What about your test?

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.890
Like I said...

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.320
It's my decision to make.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.010
And all three of you pass!

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.620
Yay!

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.590
And so began Gon's journey...

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.190
To follow in his father's footsteps
and become a Hunter.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.620
Next time: Test x Of x Tests.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.720
Look forward to it!
