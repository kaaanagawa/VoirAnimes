WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Tonight, at 9 PM,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.610
Ivlenkov,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.610
Tocino,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.610
and Baise,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.240
you'll handle the bidding.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.680
What about the rest of us?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.150
Basho and Linssen

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.240
will cover the rear entrance.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.250
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.780
Squala and I will guard the lady.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.380
And with that,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.010
the mission begins.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.050
A x Shocking x Tragedy

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.600
The Nostrade Family has
learned that someone

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.530
plans to attack the
underground auction run

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.290
by the Mafia community.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.400
Kurapika and the other bodyguards

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
have begun their assignments.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.230
Everyone's here...

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.680
These are mostly Mafia leaders.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.430
We even have some head honchos here.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.220
I'm surprised.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.880
Why?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.190
It's only an auction...

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.230
They could send an agent.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.070
Their honor's on the line.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.710
For each winning bid,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.120
five percent goes back into the
Mafia community as a commission.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.040
Does that act as a bribe?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.010
Like, the more they bid,
the more they'll receive?

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.330
Yeah,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.670
that's how the Mafia flexes
its financial muscles.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.300
So this is a chance to improve
their standings.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.470
But some gangs have gone bust

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.590
because they overbid.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.300
It's about to start.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.860
Okay...

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.510
Welcome, everyone.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.600
So, I'm skipping the formalities.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.310
Die.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.950
My Ambidextrous Automatic Weapons
Double Machine Gun

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.210
Get down!

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.180
Black Balloons!

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.580
Guard me.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.210
Thankless Heroes
Eleven Black Children

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.810
Is he using Nen bullets?!

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.600
That means he's also an Emitter!

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.690
He'll break through my Nen barrier,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.940
and pierce my body...

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.240
Each bullet packs an incredible punch!

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.370
Run!

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.620
Inform the boss—

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.220
Baise, you go ahead...

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.080
That was way too fast...

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.290
I didn't get to do anything.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.260
All yours, Shizuku.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.640
Let's go, Blinky.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.400
Suck up the bodies, blood,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.040
body parts, and all their possessions.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.900
Grab the chairs, too.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.870
Shizuku's <i>Nen</i> ability is always
entertaining to watch.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.620
Oh?

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.100
Someone's still alive.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.040
Wh-Who are you?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.890
Doesn't matter.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.060
You're all dead...

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.860
The community will

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.360
destroy you.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.860
Your family!

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.990
Torture you... Cut you up.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.760
You'll taste hell!

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.880
Family?

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.100
What's that?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.140
I'm having difficulty hearing clearly,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.190
but there's a real commotion
inside the building.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.690
Something must have happened.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.540
Contact the leader!

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.530
Got it.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.820
I'll contact Linssen and Basho.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.870
You two head inside!

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.330
Wha...

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.170
What?

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.570
There's no one here.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.720
Where did they go?
Search the place!

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.710
Hey, what happened to
the merchandise?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.720
Underground... Head underground, now!

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.630
It appears that everyone in the
auction house has disappeared.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.550
What?

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.480
The whole place is in an uproar.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.240
It's out of control.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.500
What about the merchandise?

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.980
Melody is heading underground, to the safe.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.990
I-It's empty...

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.840
The goods for today's auction
have been stolen!

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.490
Who did this?!

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.940
Damn!

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.520
Where'd they go?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.250
Split up and search, fool!

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.890
Send word to every gang...

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.180
Quickly!

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.760
Okay, understood.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.260
We'll catch those thieves.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.670
I'll head over.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.350
Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho
behind the building, in Central Park.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.620
Squala...

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.490
Yes?

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.450
Just in case, leave five dogs behind.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.030
Right.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.750
Listen up!

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.400
Don't take your eyes off the boss!

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.060
Don't let anyone in the
room until we return.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.040
Yes.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.440
All roads are sealed.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.790
The only remaining escape
route is by air!

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.080
If you see any suspicious
aircraft, contact me.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.540
Make sure not to kill them.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.060
The community has offered
a substantial reward to

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.110
the gang that captures the thieves.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.160
You must take them alive!

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.810
There wasn't any merchandise?

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.190
No, the safe was empty.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.170
According to the auctioneer,
the only one who knew the situation,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.070
everything in the safe had been
moved a few hours earlier.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.450
Exactly as though they
expected this to happen.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.090
Don't you find the timing too perfect?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.020
We have a...

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.130
Judas among us.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.970
We have a Judas among us.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.230
You're saying that one of us is a traitor?

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.580
There are no traitors.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.740
Besides, Judas wasn't a traitor.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.700
It's said that Judas sold Jesus out
for thirty pieces of silver.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.750
But how much would a traitor ask

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.750
from the Mafia?

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.680
Consider the merits...

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.760
What would the traitor gain
by selling us to the Mafia?

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.510
Money?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.020
Glory?

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.520
Prestige?

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.170
Do you truly believe

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.770
that any of us cares for those things?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.200
It's unlikely...

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.220
You see?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.640
Besides, something else
here doesn't add up.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.660
Huh?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.520
Assuming there were a spy,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.910
the response was too tepid.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.440
If they had foreknowledge

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.550
that Class-A bounties would
appear at the auction,

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.180
they would have increased security.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.900
The auction goers were all
uninformed and unarmed.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.250
That's true.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.190
I believe that someone

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.690
provided information
that wasn't explicit.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.520
However, a Mafia community leader

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.320
believed that information.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.400
I don't get it...

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.980
Who told who what?

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.310
Whatever.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.710
So what do we do?

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.270
Did you ask the auctioneer

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.560
where the merchandise was moved?

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.100
Yeah, but

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.120
he swore on his life that he didn't know.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.600
Feitan tortured him, so he wasn't lying.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.860
He had the worst luck of them all today.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.030
Did you get the names of
anyone who might know?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.860
You bet I did.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.660
The auction is run by the
Mafia community heads,

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.830
who lead gangs in each of the
ten districts around the world.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.370
They're called the Ten Dons.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.390
This is the only time that all
ten gather in one place,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.380
to discuss business and issue orders.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.150
Their commands are carried
out by a special force,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.590
the Shadow Beasts.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:09.500
This squad consists of each
don's best combatants.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.450
I see, then...

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.110
Since the Shadow Beasts weren't
guarding the auction house,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.110
the Mafia didn't know we were coming.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.650
That makes sense.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.030
Then how did they move
the merchandise?

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.570
That's right...

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.380
I heard that a single Shadow Beasts
member turned up at the safe.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.860
The twenty-five square-meter
safe was packed with

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.640
items ready to be auctioned off.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.410
The Shadow Beast walked in, then
walked right back out, empty-handed.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.410
But the safe was emptied.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.070
It was a man in sunglasses,
calling himself Owl.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.860
He must possess a <i>Nen</i> power
similar to Shizuku's.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.540
Probably.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.530
Surely they noticed

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.540
after five hundred people disappeared...

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.040
That they're facing <i>Nen</i> users.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.990
Can we let loose?

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.850
Naturally.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.400
Put on a show for the pursuers.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.900
That will draw them out.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.660
I can't wait...

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.860
Up there!

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.330
It's them! They're in a hot air balloon!

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.250
The balloon is moving toward
the Gordeau Desert!

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.320
We're in pursuit!

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.040
Hot air balloon?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.660
Not an airship?

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.830
Then what became of the
hundreds of guests?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.750
It's possible that we aren't dealing

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.470
with an ordinary band of armed thugs.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.610
Contact the Ten Dons.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.130
Ask them to immediately
dispatch the Shadow Beasts!

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.990
Hurry, they're headed for
the Gordeau Desert.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.960
Okay!

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.540
Roger that.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.300
Come down here!

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.880
We'll even let you decide whether
you'll be drowned or buried!

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.330
There's a whole crowd...

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.530
I don't have to suck them up, do I?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.460
No, they don't matter.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.640
Hey!

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.950
Stay out of this.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.640
I'll handle it...

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.860
Wait!

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.330
Are you the ones who
kidnapped the guests?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.160
Yeah.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.300
Well, you do have guts.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.420
Who's your leader?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.920
Bastard.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.120
His philosophy is

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.740
to be the strongest

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.000
of them all...

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.320
An ordinary gun wouldn't
even scratch him.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.600
Physically, he's the strongest.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.600
It's like watching a gorilla stomping ants.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.310
Oh?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.360
More of them.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.020
They came all the way here,
merely to be killed.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.780
Just watching isn't any fun.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.320
Let's play cards.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.210
Yes.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.300
I agree.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.480
Boss!

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.410
That wasn't enough to warm me
up for the Shadow Beasts.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.530
Ow...

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.690
A rifle?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.780
How annoying.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.700
Trying to take me out from afar?

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.520
Yeah! Bull's-eye!

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.590
That's enough!

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.800
Don't get too cocky, monster.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.680
This super-bazooka is strong
enough to take out a tank.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.290
You'll be blown to smithereens!

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.010
How sad...

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.690
You're comparing me
to some little tank?

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.190
Die!

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.870
Did I get him?

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.880
That kinda hurt...

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.890
None of you will escape!

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.390
It appears the enemy can use <i>Nen</i>...

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.780
And he's ridiculously strong.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.880
The advance force was obliterated.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.660
Guns are ineffective against him.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.540
Impossible...

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.840
See for yourself.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.410
His aura is unbelievable.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.340
As is the number of corpses.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.200
Who is that guy?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.470
He's tearing through people
like scraps of paper.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.070
We're supposed to capture him?

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.260
I won't be part of that!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.650
I agree.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.610
I don't see how we can win...

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.100
Indeed.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.730
However, we cannot abandon
our mission and back off.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.160
But...

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.880
Wait.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.950
I suddenly hear an additional
heartbeat coming from somewhere...

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.380
I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.890
Which group do you belong to?

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.720
We're bodyguards for
the Nostrade Family.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.400
I see.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.400
It seems that you can use <i>Nen</i>,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.920
but don't bother.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.400
These aren't ordinary thugs.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.660
To them, taking lives is like breathing.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.410
Y-You could say they're
professional killers.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.610
And a pro knows his trade best of all.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.860
Rabid Dog.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.290
I'm Leech.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.010
I-I'm Porcupine.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.780
We Shadow Beasts will see to them.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.770
These are the Shadow Beasts...

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.190
The Mafia community has
unleashed the Shadow Beasts

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.410
on the bandits who attacked the auction.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.490
Kurapika still has yet to
realize that they are

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.710
facing off against the Phantom Troupe.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:14.830
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.500
Today, we introduce Baise!

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.620
A Hunter hired as one
of Neon's bodyguards.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.380
Her <i>Nen</i> ability is called Instant Lover.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.030
She uses her charms to get close to men,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.830
With <i>Nen</i>, she makes anyone she
kisses her slave for 180 minutes.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.720
pretend she's into them, and kiss them!

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.380
Be careful, you men.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.330
Next time: Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.240
Excuse me, do bananas count as snacks?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.380
Does chocolate count as a snack?

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.320
That's always been a snack!
