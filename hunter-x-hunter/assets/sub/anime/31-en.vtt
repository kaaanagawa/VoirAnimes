00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.790
The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.490
You can make your body harder,

A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

A technique to create an

These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.020 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.770
Master?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.580
Master...

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.940
I may have

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.620
awakened an incredible beast...

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.620
Destiny x And x Tenacity

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.200
One month has passed

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.370
since Gon was badly injured
in his match with Gido.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.000
In Heavens Arena,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.080
all eyes are focused on a
certain upcoming match.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.760
Gon, I got something good...

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.420
Oh, Killua,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.770
I was about to go looking for you.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.960
Uh...

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.440
Are you really healed?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.470
Yeah!

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.850
See? I'm perfectly fine!

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.410
Okay, I get it.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.850
Those injuries should've kept him
out of action for four months,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.160
but he recovered in a month.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.970
Man, what is your body made of?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.360
How to answer that...

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.200
You're weird.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.930
Well?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.820
Weren't you about to say something?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.670
Oh, here.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.430
Tickets?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.930
These aren't just tickets.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.380
They're for Hisoka's fight.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.690
As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.990
The tickets to Hisoka's match
are a really hot item.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.840
There are even scalpers hawking them.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.440
Oh...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.110
So I've been gathering information.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.710
It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.350
He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.800
Each KO has led to death.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.880
But he's lost three matches...

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.700
His three losses were due to forfeits.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.360
Forfeits?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.550
He reached the registration deadline,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.300
so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.890
Which means...

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.890
If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.890
Yeah.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.590
And he's only given up a total of four points.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.760
One knockdown, three clean hits.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.830
He's as strong as a Floor Master.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.990
I'm in trouble...

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.160
Jeez.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.170
You don't look like someone who
thinks they're in trouble.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.670
So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.150
Two years ago, he claimed the sole
knockdown against Hisoka.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.740
And of the four points scored against Hisoka,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.850
he's responsible for three.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.800
He scored three points against Hisoka...

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.520
You could say they have a history.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.060
Apparently, they both registered for the
same day so they could fight each other.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.440
You should have the chance to
analyze Hisoka's fighting style.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.510
Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.410
But is this okay?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.540
I promised Wing-san...

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.090
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.750
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.230
Of course it's okay!

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.560
You'll just be watching a match.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.560
It is not okay!

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.890
Viewing a match counts as learning about <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.730
W-Wing-san...

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.320
Don't scare us.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.070
Gon-kun,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.460
has your arm healed?

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.950
Y-Yes! It's fine now.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.330
He has unbelievable regenerative powers.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.560
Since he's recovered, he can
watch the match, right?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.840
No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.570
Gon-kun, you should spend one more month

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.970
practicing "Ten," and recovering
from your injuries.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.870
Oh...

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.920
Okay, I understand.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.600
Well,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.170
then it's fine.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.980
Osu! Take care.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.120
Oh, well...

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.320
You'll have to watch a recording,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.170
so I'll go and see it in person.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.490
He's kept his promise.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.120
He's only practiced "Ten" each day.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.270
I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.620
under normal circumstances.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.880
Their auras flow like serene rivers.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.230
Master?

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.050
Hmm?

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.150
Oh, never mind...

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.630
It's nothing.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.760
This won't do...

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.890
I'm the one who's losing control.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.900
Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.450
Today in Heavens Arena,
we have Kastro versus Hisoka,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.050
the match you've all been waiting for!

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.500
Just look at this crowd!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.550
The match doesn't start for another hour,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.950
but the arena is already packed!

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.760
This is a promise thread.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.390
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.790
Two years ago, Hisoka was
the winner of their match.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.850
The audience is fired up to
watch this match of destiny,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.980
as Kastro looks for revenge!

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.550
Sporting an 8-3 record, with all three losses

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.490
being forfeits due to absence,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.410
we have the deadly magician with the
tendency toward absence, Hisoka!

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.400
And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.190
one win away from the Floor Masters after
nine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.610
we have the martial artist, Kastro!

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.570
Will he avenge his earlier loss,
as he's predicted?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.260
Get ready for a battle between the two fighters

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.860
nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.360
Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.520
Next up, we have an interview with
Kastro, from a few days ago.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.480
I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.160
You'll see that I'm not the same
person I was two years ago.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.670
Oh, he sounds confident...

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.230
We'll see if he can back it up.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.130
Wh-What?

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.010
There he is.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.780
Was there something you needed?

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.280
What?

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.530
R-Ridiculous.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.530
He was just sitting on the couch...

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.540
When did he move?

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.110
Did he open the door and slip behind me,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.090
without catching my attention?

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.550
No, that's impossible!

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.490
I never took my eyes off the door

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.010
until after he spoke.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.060
He never had the chance.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.310
How did he do this?

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.970
W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.810
From me?

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.560
You honor me,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.950
Killua-kun.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.790
I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.930
You're not with Gon?

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.850
Oh, so you do know everything.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.150
Are you here to scout an opponent?

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.000
Nope,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.500
I just wanted a closer look.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.750
And what do you think?

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.760
You're pretty damn good.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.990
Thank you.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.120
Your <i>Zetsu</i> was quite impressive.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.530
However, you should have

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.510
concealed your presence
before reaching this floor.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.330
When an aura as strong as yours disappears,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.810
that would put most of us on alert.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.270
You've been following up on me
since I reached this floor?

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.510
Pretty much.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.240
Then I want to know...

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.160
How did you do that just now?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.700
Unfortunately, I can't tell you.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.910
After all, I might have to fight you someday.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.660
Don't worry.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.120
I'm not interested in fighting here again.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.170
Really?

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.830
That isn't what your aura says.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.410
That was a joke.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.570
I'll answer your question when we fight.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.300
I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.480
I'm sure you can get there.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.810
I told you I'm not interested in fighting!

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.830
Yes, it's finally time...

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.330
The long-awaited rematch between
Hisoka and Kastro!

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.170
I'm very grateful, Hisoka.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.730
If not for the initiation you gave me back then,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.840
I'd never have become this strong.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.590
You mean to imply that you're stronger now?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.190
Just so you're aware,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.630
I never used my full strength

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.100
in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.930
Those matches were nothing more

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.110
than a warm-up for my defeat of you.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.730
Begin!

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.530
Here I come!

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.660
A clean hit!

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.150
Kastro has landed the first strike!

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.280
What was that?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.460
Give me your best shot, Hisoka.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.600
Kastro is the one to land the first strike!

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.520
Hisoka has surrendered the first point,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.600
after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.550
Again... An illusion?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.160
I'm not the same person I was two years ago.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.990
I won't hold back on my next attack.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.420
You'll have my best shot when
I deem it necessary.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.580
Very well.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.310
Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.440
Again...

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.600
I was sure he dodged that!

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.270
What's wrong?

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.410
Will you just run around, rather than attack?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.020
Clean hit! And knockdown!

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.890
What an amazing start!

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.640
Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.970
The score is now 4-0.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.100
However, are my eyes deceiving me?

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.150
Have you still not changed your mind?

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.900
Would you prefer to die ignorant?

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.410
C-Can you fight?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.420
If I am not mistaken,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.800
you seemed to disappear...

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.470
That's right!

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.850
He disappeared!

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.680
That's what I saw!

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.510
No,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.680
that is not an accurate description.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.480
You were readying a kick from the front,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.940
when suddenly, you were behind me.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.960
I suppose that would be more precise.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.320
But that doesn't sound right...

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.600
Something is off.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.700
Yes,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.330
I feel I'm missing something very basic here...

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.700
It's futile.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.340
If you continue to run in circles,
you'll never learn the truth.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.720
Because I'm done waiting.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.590
I'll take your arm with my next strike.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.600
If you still will not attack,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.710
then so be it.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.450
It seems you weren't good enough.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.280 line:20%
Tiger Bite Fist

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.020
He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.030
Kastro's getting serious!

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.660
Tiger Bite Fist?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.380
That technique

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.970
can split a tree in two, when used by a master.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.380
Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't
figured out Kastro's ability.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.050
Well, I don't really understand it, either.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.550
At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.930
Here I come!

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.060
Go ahead and take it.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.570
Not worried, huh?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.520
Or is this meant to be a trap?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.570
Either way,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.820
I'll take your arm!

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.530
Your other one.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.240
Hisoka's arm!

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.020
Hisoka's right arm has been severed!

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.720
You shouldn't assume that
I'll act the way you want.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.720
This was just part of the plan.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.240
What crap.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.470
Have we ever seen Hisoka in
such a perilous situation?

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.800
He's taken considerable damage!

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.380
I understand.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.490
Your ability is, in fact,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.120
a double.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.350
Impressive.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.620
You are correct.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.320
A double?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.880
What does he mean?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.020
Then it wasn't an illusion!

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.990
When Kastro attacked,

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.730
there really were two of him.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.060
What is going on here?

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.200
Kastro has split into two?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.780
Cloned himself?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.200
Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.050
Does he actually have a twin?!

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.960
Is this your doppelganger?

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.520
Indeed.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.560
Doppelganger?

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.970
Yes.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.350
Master, what does that mean?

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.100
It refers to a double, as in an additional you.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.930
When you spot someone who resembles you,

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.420
that's called a doppelganger.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.860
Er, I don't get it...

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.280
When you encounter a doppelganger,

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.460
you experience headaches and fatigue,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.300
which continue until your double is destroyed.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.030
Some believe that the double

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.100
takes energy from the original.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.990
B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.580
He's really strong.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.760
That's only a story.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.760
Besides, he mastered this
ability through training.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.650
I listened to your warning,

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.860
and I watched carefully, rather than run.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.110
And it turns out my deduction that
you disappeared was correct.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.590
So why did I question that description?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.670
That's because

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.340
I still sensed your presence beside me.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.840
In fact, right before you disappeared,

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.220
I felt a new presence.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.140
You duplicate yourself before disappearing.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.890
I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.650
I was able to successfully create a double with <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.960
My double goes on the attack,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.400
while I hide in the shadows.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.070
As soon as you react,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.910
I dismiss my double, and attack.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.260
So those fluttering clothes were
meant to help him hide.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.770
The most skilled Nen user would still experience

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.020
difficulty in figuring out
this trick, while in combat.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.670
Naturally,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.720
my double is no mere illusion.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.680
It exists as a second me until I send it away.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.690
You know this after suffering
an attack from my double.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.940
In other words, you must fight both of my selves.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.400
This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
completed through the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.410
I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.410 line:20%
True Tiger Bite Fist

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.100
Incredible! We have an
upset in the making!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.620
Hisoka, the winner two years ago,
is in deep trouble!

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.140
Will Kastro be able to avenge
his previous defeat?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.800
Next, I will take your left arm.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.430
Will you continue to act disinterested?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.170
Hmm, let's see...

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.710
I think I have a little motivation now.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.450
The fearsome double-user, Kastro,

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.200
and the magician, Hisoka.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.880
Their incredible battle will have
an unthinkable end,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.210
but Gon knows nothing of all this yet.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.860
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.740
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:14.460
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.750
Today, we introduce Riehlvelt.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.830
A 200s class warrior.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.660
He uses his aura to move his wheelchair.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:15.500
Fights with <i>Nen</i> and his
custom wheelchair
and dual whips.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.270
He fights with two whips.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.720
There's probably a secret behind them.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.870
Whippie.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.950
Next time: A x Surprising x Win!

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.050
Gon, if you could clone yourself,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.190
what would you do?

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.550
Play rock-paper-scissors with myself!

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.300
Wouldn't you always end up tying?
