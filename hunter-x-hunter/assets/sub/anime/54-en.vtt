00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.030
Fortunes x Aren't x Right?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.690
Ready, go!

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.670
Kurapika!

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.100
This is great.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.940
Huh?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.590
The spiders are dead,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.930
so you can finally focus on your main goal.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.680
You have to find the eyes of your people.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.410
Gon...

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.090
Yep.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.580
If there's anything we can do to help—

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.700
Hey!

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.930
You did it first.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.940
I was getting revenge!

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.690
But I didn't do it on purpose.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.950
You did it deliberately!

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.790
Why are you so upset?

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.840
We sold that piece for 355 million Jenny!

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.210
It could have sold for more...

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.630
We got a decent price!

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.850
No, we could have gotten over 400
million if we'd sold at a different time.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.100
We had bad luck...

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.170
You sure take this seriously.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.820
It isn't like you would've gotten anything
if we'd gotten a better price.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.640
That's not the issue here.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.610
If we run with the money,
we'd each get a 170 million cut!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.620
Are you really friends with Gon and Killua?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.260
I was joking.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.860
Hello?

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.270
Oh, Kurapika!

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.800
It's been a while since we
were all together last!

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.700
Yeah.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.440
Where's Zepile-san?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080
He wanted to validate our check

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.770
and find more hidden gems to sell.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.340
Anyway...

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.780
What?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.770
You've got this intensity about you...

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.400
You seem a little more intimidating now.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.690
Really?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.710
You don't seem to have changed much.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.940
And you're more annoying, too!

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh, I heard that you defeated
a member of the Troupe.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.130
Having only just learned <i>Nen</i>,
how did you manage that?

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.980
If you're looking for advice
on catching the spiders,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.170
then stop.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.360
That's not the only reason.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.070
We want to master <i>Nen</i>.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.590
Because we'll definitely
need <i>Nen</i> in the future.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.390
Then you don't want my advice.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.280
It won't do you any good.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.190
Why not?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.940
My power can only be
used against the Troupe.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.750
Huh?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.700
Restraint and vow?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.640
Yeah.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.710
<i>Nen</i> is strongly affected by your mental state.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.630
The stronger your resolve,
the more power you receive.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.710
However, you also incur a
big risk at the same time.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.830
In return for <i>Nen</i> power,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.870
I vowed to use it against the spiders alone.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.970
I established a rule for myself.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.900
What's the rule?

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.730
If I use my chains on one who isn't a spider,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.480
I will forfeit my life.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.920
Huh? What do you mean?

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.420
There is a <i>Nen</i> blade pointed at my heart.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.440
If I break the rule,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.120
that blade will pierce my heart, killing me.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.890
This is the rule that shows my resolve.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.870
Restraint and vow.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.080
My power is the product of pure hatred.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.010
It only works on the spiders.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.010
I'm telling you because I trust you.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.160
Don't tell anyone else.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.840
Why...

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.770
Why would you tell us something so important?!

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.700
I'm not sure.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.780
With their leader's death,
I must have relaxed.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.110
It'll be fine if we keep our mouths shut.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.030
It's too dangerous.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.780
One of the surviving members can read minds.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.660
If they find out, Kurapika won't
be able to beat them!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.490
But she didn't learn anything last time.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.490
That's because we didn't know
Kurapika was the chain user.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.750
Then we just have to stay away from them.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.040
They've already checked you,
so they think you're clean.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.560
But there's also a guy called Nobunaga.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.540
He's especially dangerous.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.100
He's looking for Kurapika,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.470
and he's still trying to chase us down.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.570
Is he aware that you guys know Kurapika?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.190
No...

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.090
Then it's okay!

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.750
As long as no one around the mind reader

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.740
knows Kurapika, then you're safe.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.330
Well, I've also been in
contact with Hisoka.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.080
What?!

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.710
Hisoka?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.090
He knows that I am the chain user.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.330
We made a pact,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.470
but his target, the leader of
the spiders, is now dead.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.390
So I don't know what he'll do.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.540
What do you mean?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.610
We're leaving?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.810
I mean exactly what I say.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.860
We're departing tonight.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.110
We'll take the rest of the treasure tonight.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.370
That will be the end.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.240
It isn't.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.360
What else is there?

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.100
We have to find the chain user.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.860
You seem obsessed.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.500
Yes, I am.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.510
We're going to scatter
without avenging Uvo?

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.730
Uvo will be bored in the next
world if we don't send

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.890
the chain user to join him.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.990
Cut it out, Nobunaga.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.530
The boss has issued an order.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.140
Yeah, and an order from
the boss is absolute.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.250
But is that really an order from our boss,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.380
Chrollo?

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.180
Nobunaga, watch yourself...

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.220
Shut up!

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.280
I'm talking to Chrollo!

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.290
Before I can answer your question...

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.040
Nobunaga,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.530
I need you to answer my question.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.140
Nobunaga,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.390
I need you to answer my question.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.020
What's your date of birth?

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.450
Huh?

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.020
What day were you born?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.770
September 8th, 70.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.530
Blood type?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.470
B.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.150
Name?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.990
Nobunaga Hazama...

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.330
You already know that!

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.510
The hell is this about?!

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.290
What do you want next?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.640
No, that's enough.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.030
Write all of that on this sheet of paper.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.290
Why didn't you tell me to
do that in the first place?

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.290
Huh? What's this?

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.760
A one hundred percent accurate
fortune written in verse.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.160
The ability to see the future.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.950
I stole this power from Nostrade's daughter.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.950
One hundred percent accurate?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.710
Each of the four verses predicts
what will happen in that week.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.090
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.200
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.980
The first moon, having missed his opportunity,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.530
continues to pursue the eleventh moon alone.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.910
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.170
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.550
But the spider does not stop.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.440
Even after losing half its limbs.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.270
This is the fortune his
daughter gave me yesterday.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.080
Is the precious component of the calendar...

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.830
Uvo.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.360
That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.860
In other words, she predicted our attack

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.990
on the Mafia auction.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.850
And there were fans of her
fortunetelling among the Ten Dons.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.630
I get it.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.980
That explains why the merchandise

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.630
had already been moved the
first time we attacked.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.230
What does Nobunaga's fortune say?

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.370
The pen writes by itself.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.080
I don't know what was written.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.860
Ask Nobunaga.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.310
Well, Nobunaga?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.500
Next week, five of us will probably die.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.230
Which five?

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.260
No idea...

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.130
I can't interpret this.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.770
I kind of understand the second verse.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.010
The spider loses half its limbs.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.480
The spider would be us?

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.730
Yeah.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.130
And the limbs would be the members,

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.020
so half would be six.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.150
That means five more after losing Uvo.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.600
The same line was in my fortune.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.150
Let me see.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.160
Boss, can you tell my fortune?

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.820
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.050
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.690
You join your ally as an offering,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.790
to keep him from being lonely.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.370
You will find eternal rest

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.840
in a room filled with black merchandise.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.800
Beware solitude above all.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.850
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.160
I thought so.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.550
I'm going to die next week.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.290
Seriously?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.140
Yep.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.210
Because I only got two verses.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.870
And Pakunoda and Shalnark will die, as well.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.240
How do you know that?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.880
It seems the numbered months
here refer to Troupe members.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.340
November is the eleventh month.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.860
Uvo was member #11.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.070
Exactly.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.260
The chrysanthemum is the
flower of September.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.010
It blooms in August, the eighth month,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.420
and it withers in June.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.890
This refers to members #6, #8, and #9.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.270
And since the word "falling"
is used, it implies death.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.900
I'm not certain to whom "Scarlet Eyes" refers.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.480
It isn't one of us.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.780
I'm guessing it's the chain user.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.860
Scarlet Eyes...

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.340
I remember now.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.460
The clan whose eyes turned red.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.800
Then there was a survivor?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.040
So it seems...

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.550
Will he also die?

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.070
Hard to say.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.670
It could just mean that he's covered in blood.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.420
Nobunaga, this means we'll
suffer serious casualties

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.380
if we fight the chain user!

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.560
We'll lose half our members.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.020
You and I have abilities that
can be easily replaced,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.060
but Shizuku and Pakunoda have rare powers.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.690
The Troupe can't afford to lose them.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.750
Today is Saturday of the first week.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.370
If we return home today,

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.710
we won't run into the chain user next week.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.460
The advantage of being able
to predict the future

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.710
is that we can avoid undesirable prophecies.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.490
If we leave this place without
fighting the chain user,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.940
this fortune is one hundred percent
certain to not come true.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.030
Nobunaga, you and Uvo were
the Troupe's attackers.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.970
To die is just part of your job.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.490
I believe that you both chose
that role voluntarily.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.370
Yeah, that's right...

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.130
Shizuku, Paku, and Shal collect intelligence.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.300
They provide our support.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.760
You could say they're our lifeline.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.000
Isn't it your job to serve as their shield?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.680
Yeah, it is!

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.510
Wait...

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.470
You should tell some of the
other members' fortunes.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.460
Perhaps we could gather additional
clues for avoiding the prophecy.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.730
What do we do?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.910
Now that we know Kurapika's secret,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.110
it's dangerous to wait around.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.250
If Nobunaga captures either Gon or me again,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.370
we probably won't be able to escape.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.350
But we have Kurapika with us now.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.980
We should take them out

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.420
before they have a chance
to recover and escape.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.050
We know where their current base is.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.650
If we take too long, they might get away.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.950
We need to move fast.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.640
They could be making an
escape as we speak.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.060
We don't have time for too much thought.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.390
The woman you mentioned
is certainly a threat...

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.310
But since their leader is dead,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.410
I'll do as Gon says, and focus on
recovering my brethren's eyes.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.790
Seriously?!

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.740
Yeah.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.430
You're sure about this?

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.000
Kurapika's made up his mind.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.010
We can't force him to change it.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.040
Sorry, Killua.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.260
Thank you for the valuable information.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.320
It's from Hisoka...

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.620
The dead bodies were fakes.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.430
Kurapika?

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.180
The dead bodies were fakes...

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.970
Huh?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.820
You mean the dead bodies
of the Troupe members?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.920
Yeah, the dead spiders were fakes!

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.710
It would be possible for a
Conjurer to accomplish that.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.250
Damn!

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.880
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.720
The situation's changed.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.840
What now?

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.210
We're here to help.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.470
Uh-huh.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.720
Yeah.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.010
Hello?

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.970
Kurapika, it's me.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.560
Melody?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.570
What is it?

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.430
The community has called off the hunt
for the remaining Troupe members.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.460
What?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.850
We've learned that they
came from Meteor City.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.860
The Troupe comes from Meteor City?

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.020
The Ten Dons gave the order directly.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.620
The reward has been rescinded.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.630
The reward has been rescinded?

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.240
Seriously?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.910
The Troupe comes from Meteor City.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.140
Makes sense...

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.540
That explains why their
identities are still unknown,

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.390
and why the cops haven't
been able to catch them.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.290
What's Meteor City?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.370
A city populated by people who,
as far as society is concerned, don't exist.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.150
There's a city like that?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.420
Yeah.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.350
Officially, it's unpopulated,

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.910
but it's said that ten million people live there.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.560
It began as a dump over 1,500 years ago.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.840
People began to live off the garbage

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.050
that was dumped there.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.030
You're allowed to dump anything there.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.480
From garbage to weapons, and even people.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.140
And the residents

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.250
will accept anything left there.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.370
I've heard that Meteor City
residents share a bond

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.770
thinner than that between strangers,
stronger than that between family.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.520
Actually, there are those
who provide Meteor City

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.010
with weapons and precious metals
under the pretext of garbage.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.290
That would be the Mafia community.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.770
What do you mean?

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.910
But the Mafia is hunting the Troupe!

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.680
In return, the Mafia recruited
people from Meteor City.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.710
People who didn't exist, as far
as society was concerned.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.680
Perfect for committing crimes.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.870
The Troupe destroyed the
normally intimate relationship

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.930
between the Mafia community and Meteor City.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:27.520
But the Mafia has decided to
prioritize that relationship.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.830
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.360
half angel, half death-bringer.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.520
You would do well to sell
the calendar's secrets.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.310
He will be especially pleased to
learn the eleventh moon's secret.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.580
The customer will return on a hot day,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.530
leaving you alone with a man
bearing St. Peter's cross.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.260
The false fourth moon will be
torn away from the calendar.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.300
Only six pages remain.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.820
What does your fortune say?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.200
Let me see.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.160
I don't recommend it.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.710
It'll give you a shock.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.580
Just let me see it.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.040
Very well.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.290
Look at this, everyone!

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.690
"A red-eyed customer will visit..."

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.570
"The calendar's secrets..."

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.980
That would be our secrets, right?

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.850
Hisoka, what is this?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.340
Lemme see!

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.070
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.970
seeking to make a trade.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.870
The customer will use the
sword of law upon you,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.370
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.270
The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.870
losing five more legs.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.430
Do not leave your temporary shelter,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.340
for you are one of the remaining legs.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.340
Hisoka...

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.100
Did you sell him out?

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.100
Sell out Uvo?!

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:42.760
Hisoka's fortune changed when
it was passed to Pakunoda.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.120
What could that mean?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:15.870
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.420
Today, we introduce Bonolenov.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.490
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.490
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.000
His face, body, and powers

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.950
Responsible for
guarding their base.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.080
are covered by bandages.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.870
When he removes the
bandages, strange
holes appear.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.210
Spin, spin, spin!

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.800
Next time: Allies x And x Lies.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.720
My Highness.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.900
Your Highness?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.220
His Highness Killua!

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.470
Yeah, yeah.
