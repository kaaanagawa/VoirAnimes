00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.170
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.130
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.290
You must follow me to Phase Two.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.560
This is the exam's First Phase.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.570
Hope x And x Ambition

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.310
Two hours have passed since
the start of the exam.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.330
The applicants have traveled

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.000
over thirty kilometers from the start.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.420
None of them knows how far they must go.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.000
They are forced to run at the leader's pace,
with no goal specified.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.270
It's a monotonous course with no end in sight.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.440
And many applicants have
already dropped out.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.750
<i>Extrapolating from historical data,
this exam type usually</i>

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.150
<i>involves a forty-kilometer course.</i>

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.980
<i>My calculations suggest that</i>

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.160
<i>we are nearing the goal...</i>

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.190
<i>I underestimated the Hunter Exam.</i>

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.460
<i>Every person here is a monster.</i>

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.650
<i>It's a gathering of monsters...</i>

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.890
Hey! Wait up, kid!

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.590
Hmm?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.000
You should show the
Hunter Exam some respect!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.070
What do you mean?

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.890
Why are you using a skateboard?

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.430
That's cheating!

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.710
Why?

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.650
Why...

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.800
This is an endurance test!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.810
No, it isn't.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.940
Huh?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.190
Gon, what are you saying?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.450
The examiner only told us to follow him.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.040
Whose side are you on, eh?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.740
Hey, how old are you?

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.830
I'm twelve years old.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.300
Hmm...

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.830
<i>We're the same age.</i>

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.830
Huh?

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.770
Guess I'll run too.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.020
Wow!

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.550
That was cool!

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.050
I'm Killua.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.550
I'm Gon.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.950
<i>Damn it...</i>

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430
<i>Making a fool out of me...</i>

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.770
<i>Impossible.</i>

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.860
<i>It's impossible!</i>

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.080
<i>My calculations are never wrong!</i>

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.150
<i>So why...</i>

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.340
<i>Am I... going to fail?</i>

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.060
<i>For me to fail...</i>

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.020
<i>That's absurd.</i>

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.080
<i>Unthinkable!</i>

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.580
I won't accept that!

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.300
Hey, rookie!

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.620
You're a mess.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.860
It's rare to see someone
out of steam so early.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.480
You must be a hell of an incompetent.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.530
People like you are doomed
to fail the Hunter Exam.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.840
So don't come back, snotrag!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.310
Here. Thanks.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.830
Great work.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.830
He won't recover from the abuse
we just dished out.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.560
I doubt he'll ever take the
Hunter Exam again.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.470
Anyway, Tonpa...

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.540
You really do love crushing rookies.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.590
I live for it.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.030
<i>It's been about four hours since the exam began.</i>

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.950
<i>We must have traveled at least sixty kilometers.</i>

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.130
<i>How much farther do we need to go?</i>

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.760
<i>Only one rookie, every three years,
passes the Hunter Exam.</i>

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.740
<i>So for a normal human like me,</i>

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.900
<i>it isn't even worth dreaming about...</i>

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.730
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.880
Hey, forget him.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.890
Let's get going.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.870
Screw that...

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.870
I'm gonna become a Hunter!

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.210
Damn it all!

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.310
Cool!

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.190
Let me try that later.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.300
If you let me try your skateboard, okay?

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.450
<i>We've reached the eighty-kilometer mark.</i>

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.200
<i>It is now time to pick up the pace a bit.</i>

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.940
Wait, are you serious?

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.290
That guy's insane.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.460
He's prancing up the stairs,
as if they're not even there.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.080
If he keeps up this pace,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.200
tons of people will fail.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.970
Gon, wanna race to see who finishes first?

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.040
Sure.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.130
The loser has to buy dinner.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.600
Okay, you're on!

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.120
Ready...

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.980
Go!

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.150
Leorio, are you okay?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.070
Sure!

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.600
Just look at me.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.410
I realized that I can keep going

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.500
if I don't worry about how stupid I look!

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.000
<i>I should probably follow his example.</i>

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380
Leorio...

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.720
I have a question.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.180
What?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.120
Is this too easy for you, Kurapika?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.720
Talking just wastes energy!

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.730
Are you really trying to become
a Hunter for the money?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.400
You aren't, right?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.390
We've only been together for a few days,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.140
but I know you better than that.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.490
Sure, you have a nasty attitude,
and you aren't very bright.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.240
But you're not a shallow person.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.360
I've seen many who live for money.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.330
You're nothing like them.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.250
You and your logic...

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.010
Scarlet eyes.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.260
That's why the Kurta were targeted.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.150
We Kurta are known for
our unique scarlet eyes.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.630
When our emotions are heightened,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.980
our eyes turn scarlet, as though on fire.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.120
The eyes in that scarlet state

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.530
are considered one of the seven most
beautiful colors in the world.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.520
They command high prices
on the black market.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.300
That's why the Phantom Troupe
attacked you?

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.250
They took every single eye from
my brethren's corpses.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.140
I can still hear their darkened eyes
crying out in anguish...

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.880
I swear I will capture the Phantom Troupe!

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.570
And I will reclaim the eyes of my clan!

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.280
That's why you want to be a Hunter?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.880
Yeah, if I become a Hunter with rich clients,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.540
I'll gain access to black market information.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.380
But you'll have to swallow your pride

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.460
and become the kind of Hunter you despise!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.060
The blow to my pride is nothing,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.960
measured against the suffering
my clan endured.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.930
Sorry, but I have no noble cause.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.210
Huh?

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.760
I'm just after money.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.230
Don't lie!

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.490
I'm not lying!

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.360
You really believe you can buy
everything with money?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.760
You bet!

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.950
For the right price, you can buy not only
treasures, but dreams, hearts,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.530
and even people's lives!

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.520
Take that back, Leorio!

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.120
If you're insulting the Kurta,
I won't forgive you.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.670
Why? I'm telling the truth.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.340
If I'd had money, my friend
wouldn't have died!

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.270
An illness?

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.890
It was a treatable disease...

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.910
The problem was that the
operation costs a fortune.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.580
I was naïve!

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.920
I thought I could become a doctor...

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.110
I wanted to cure kids who have
the same disease,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.420
and be able to tell them
it was free of charge!

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.250
Then I could have told his parents, too.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.790
That was my dream...

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.590
What a joke.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.230
Turns out that to become a doctor,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.810
you need even more money!

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.330
Got it?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.840
The world runs on money...

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.320
So I want money!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.020
See you at the goal, Kurapika.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.730
Catch you later, old timer.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.140
I'm not old!

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.580
I'm a teenager, just like you guys!

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.120
Huh?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.180
No way!

00:12:51.040 --> 00:13:01.130
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.130
Killua

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.180
Can't take another step...

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.750
Th-This is it...

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.060
I'm impressed that you
can keep up with me.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.880
Really?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.910
Or maybe it's just that
everyone else is too slow.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.200
Man...

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.930
The Hunter Exam is gonna be a breeze.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.030
That's no fun.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.670
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.430
Me?

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.490
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:39.920
Huh?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.170
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.340
so I thought it'd be fun.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.430
But this is disappointing.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.990
What about you?

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.210
Well, my dad's a Hunter.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.910
So I want to become a Hunter, like my dad.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.060
Hmm...

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.680
What kind of Hunter is he?

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.890
I don't know.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.650
That's kinda weird.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.590
Really?

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.280
You want to be like your dad,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.910
but you don't know anything about him?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.750
I was raised by Mito-san,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.160
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.020
Who's Mito-san?

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.920
Aunt Mito.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.170
Oh...

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.190
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.180
He passed and became a Hunter.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.890
Then he left the island.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.290
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.940
over being with me.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.530
The exit!

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.810
Whew...

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.190
Finally, I can get out of this dark tunnel!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.700
<i>Now, let's see how many made it this far.</i>

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.920
Goal!

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.190
Yay! I win.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.320
What are you talking about?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.020
I was faster...

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.120
I was.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.240
No, I was!

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.930
I was faster, so you have to buy dinner!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.000
Nope!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.270
I was faster.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.710
So you buy me dinner.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.900
But I was faster.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.590
Hey, who was faster?

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.210
I believe that you crossed the
finish line simultaneously.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.220
Oh...

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.860
Then I'll buy you dinner.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.420
Huh?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.130
Then you buy me dinner!

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.410
I don't get it.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.240
Hey, Satotz-san.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.790
Is this where the Second Phase
of the exam takes place?

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.130
No, we still have quite a way to go.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.790
Oh...

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.570
Hey, Kurapika!

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.590
Is this our destination?

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.030
No, it isn't.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.060
I see.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.350
The fog is fading.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.080
Really?

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.810
The Numere Wetlands,

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.230
also known as Swindlers Swamp.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.190
We must cross these wetlands to
reach Phase Two of the exam.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.150
This place is home to many bizarre animals,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.680
many of them being cunning, insatiable creatures

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.360
who deceive humans and prey upon them.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.870
Be very careful.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.790
If you let them fool you...

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.120
...you're dead.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.480
Wait for me!

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.150
These wetland creatures will use

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.540
every trick in the book to fool their prey.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.820
An ecosystem in which creatures
obtain food through deceit...

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.950
Hence the name Swindlers Swamp.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.990
Stay very close to me so you won't be deceived.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.190
What a joke.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.600
How can they fool us,
when we're expecting it?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.750
Don't let them fool you!

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.500
I just said that they can't.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.260
D-Don't fall for it...

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.010
He's lying to you!

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.020
He's an impostor!

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.720
He isn't an examiner...

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.270
I'm the real examiner.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.570
An impostor?

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.530
What's going on?

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.030
Then who is he?

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.220
Look at this...

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.410
He looks just like Satotz-san!

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.920
It's a Man-Faced Ape, one of the creatures
that dwell in the Numere Wetlands!

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.420
A Man-Faced Ape?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.920
Man-Faced Apes love the taste
of fresh human flesh.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.990
However, their limbs are long and thin,
so they're quite weak.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.220
That's why they disguise themselves as humans.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.600
They trick humans into following them
into these wetlands,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.510
where they team up with other animals
to kill and devour them.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.020
He intends to trap every single applicant!

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.530
Bastard...

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.530
He certainly doesn't walk like a human...

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.580
Huh?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.350
I see, I see...

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.810
That settles it...

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.720
You're the real one.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.570
<i>What? He's the real examiner?</i>

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.570
Huh?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.430
Examiners are Hunters

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.080
selected by the committee to perform
this duty without pay.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.080
Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.340
would have been able to block that attack.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.380
I shall take that as a compliment.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:00.120
However, should you attack me again,
for any reason,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.760
I will report you for turning
on an examiner.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.360
And you will be immediately disqualified.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.230
Are we clear?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.680
Sure.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.170
Nature really can be brutal to watch...

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.490
So he was a Man-Faced Ape, as well.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.800
He was attempting to confuse
the applicants,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.000
to lure some of them away.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.100
We cannot relax our guard.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.870
Yeah.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.880
You will be encountering such
deception on a regular basis.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.280
I believe that a number of you

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.890
were fooled into suspecting my identity?

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.750
Do you understand?

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:53.860
If you lose sight of me in
the Numere Wetlands fog,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.140
you will never reach the exam's Second Phase.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.150
Do bear that in mind.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.000
Then let us be on our way.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.160
Please follow me.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.530
Tsk, another marathon.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.870
And we're running through marsh this time.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.850
Running on wet ground requires more energy.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.610
The applicants have finally escaped
the long, dark tunnel.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.520
Thus far, 36 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.380
leaving 368 remaining applicants.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.680
Their next challenge is the Numere Wetlands,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.660
also known as Swindlers Swamp.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.710
The brutal Hunter Exam continues.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.390
Next time: Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.040
Okey-dokey!
