00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
Your "remote concealment" strategy

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.460
is actually named "kokoriko."

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.740
I came up with that strategy...

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.990
ten years ago.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.650
I was pretty happy

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.820
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.500
But then, I saw how to defeat it.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.990
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.370
I was so honored and touched...
My heart trembled.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.450
It felt like...

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.690
Like seeing my child brought back to life.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.940
Foolishness.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.740
I've had enough.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.590
Get some rest.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.690
Once we begin again,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.800
you won't get any more breaks.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.660
Be prepared!

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.000
Resolve x And x Awakening

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.440
This is upsetting.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.520
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.340
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.050
But...

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.170
At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.670
But I don't understand why...

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.480
That I do not understand my own mind

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.760
upsets me more than words can describe!

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.070
Did she not choose to rest?

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.930
No...

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.110
Unsightly.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.810
No sign of intelligence or dignity.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.670
How can such a being

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.570
boast a Gungi record so stellar
that it could be called

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.810
the ultimate in game theory?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.870
Wake up! We're starting again.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.250
Y-Yes...

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.300
9-5-1, marshal.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.230
For this match...

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.440
Hmm?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.240
We should make a wager.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.380
A wager?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.750
Correct.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.010
If you win, I shall grant
any wish you request.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.800
Any wish I request?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.600
Any wish...

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.510
However...

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.980
If you lose,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.010
I shall take your left arm.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.430
Fear and desire hold the power

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.030
to disrupt one's rhythm.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.900
Desire clouds vision,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.180
while fear stills one's step.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.040
My left arm...

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.070
My left arm...

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.630
Should I do it?!

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.060
Why do you hesitate?

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.700
Well... Instead of my left arm...

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.570
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.000
What?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.070
What do you bet?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.070
My life.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.360
If I lose, I will offer you my life.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.080
But you might consider that an insult...

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.290
I do not understand.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.340
Explain yourself.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.060
Um...

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.170
Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.600
In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.370
But professional Gungi players,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.420
even national champions, make but a pittance.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.160
Only after you become the world
champion as representative for a nation

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.090
will you receive any meaningful reward.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.030
To become the national representative,
you must win tournaments.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.330
In other words, you cannot lose a single match.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.690
I come from a family of twelve,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.100
and in our home, I'm the breadwinner.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.990
If I lose a single match,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.140
I will become the greatest burden on my family.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.430
Gungi players have a saying...

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.620
That, after losing once, a Gungi master
becomes a normal person.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.400
If I lose,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.300
I'll be garbage.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.300
Ah, it doesn't bother me!

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.960
It's just what my parents always said...

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.120
So, the day I set my sights on
becoming a professional player,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.300
I decided that if I ever lost a match,
I would take my own life.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.400
But that could be a problem...

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.780
How so?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.450
When I lose, I'll become garbage...

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.450
And all you'd receive for
winning would be garbage.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.200
That would be a terrible insult.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.460
It doesn't bother me.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.820
I'm more interested in learning
what you'd want if you win.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.820
You see...

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.270
I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.530
I'll think about it later, after I win.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.090
Very well.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.990
Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.940
Your life, was it?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.610
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.120
I never imagined that, if you won,
you might ask for my life.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.960
Your Majesty!

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.050
Silence!

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.860
The Supreme Leader's l-li—

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.400
I w-would never ask such a thing!

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.430
The thought never crossed my mind!

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.640
I know that.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.880
The fault is my own.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.630
The wager is off.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.800
It was a petty tactic.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.650
No...

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.150
Accept this apology.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.860
Your Majesty!

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.400
How could you do that?

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.670
I must treat your arm...

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.760
Come with me!

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.970
Y-Your arm?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.660
Continue the match.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.790
Huh? Huh?

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.950
What happened, Supreme Leader?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.730
It's your turn. Make your move.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.920
Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.180
Do not make me repeat myself.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.240
Continue the match.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.190
It was I who said there would be no more breaks.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.260
Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.880
I shall summon Neferpitou.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.750
I am sure that you can continue to play,

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.250
as your arm is reattached.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.700
That is the best compromise I can offer.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.210
If you refuse to accept it,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.460
you may take my head now!

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.410
Very well.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.640
Come closer.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.220
I shall end it with a single strike.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.610
It's your turn.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.920
Make your move.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.910
I refuse.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.560
I refuse to move before you
have your injury treated.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.590
Don't make me repeat myself.
Make your move.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.190
I refuse.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.500
If you wish to kill me,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.950
use Gungi!

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.370
Why, you...

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.440
Summon Pitou!

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.760
At once!

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.390
There's no doubt.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.460
All the puppets have vanished.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.620
Have they resumed the selection process?

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.800
No, I doubt it.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.630
We have the capital surrounded.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.650
The King's safety is their top priority.
They wouldn't leave him.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.750
Then what's going on?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.050
My assumption would be that
some threat greater than us

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.530
has befallen the Royal Guard,
or upon the King himself.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.840
So this is it?

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.290
Our golden opportunity?

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.310
Yes...

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.740
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.760
However, it may be a trap.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.270
That shouldn't be the case...

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.980
They wouldn't use any tactic that
might endanger the King.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.240
They would if the King ordered it.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.190
I suppose...

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.110
Regardless, they've retracted
their long-range radar.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.700
We should use this chance to
get as close as possible.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.660
I must create a portal near the palace,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.010
or the plan will fail.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.250
This dangerous job had to be done eventually.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.910
And the time is now.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.740
There!

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.720
I found them.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.750
It appears Cheetu failed.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.090
Try not to die.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.040
Same to you.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.550
They've split up for us.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.210
I found them.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.050
We'll switch to the man with the pipe!

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.950
Let's go!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.540
Doctor Blythe.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.330
Toy Repair
Doctor Blythe

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.590
7-9-1, spy.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.090
2-3-1, pawn.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.290
How long will the operation take?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.600
I'd say two or three hours
until complete recovery.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.710
And during that time, you cannot use
either your puppets or <i>En</i>, correct?

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.610
This ability requires a lot of <i>Nen</i>.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.770
A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.620
While you treat His Majesty,
I shall watch the surroundings.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.040
Though my <i>En</i> is nowhere as effective as yours.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.230
Regardless, this is an important task
that I cannot trust to anyone else.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.720
<i>As expected, I cannot sense any</i> En <i>use...</i>

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.690
The rain helps to lower visibility.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.240
Soon, the sun will set.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.480
Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.660
And picking out enemy aura will be easier.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.410
Be patient.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.660
The closer the portal is to
the palace, the better.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.470
But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.630
While I can enter and exit freely,

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.140
Shoot and the rest can only use
the portal to leave once they enter.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.180
If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.100
it will mean serious trouble.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.920
I must prepare three exits in the area
around the palace, one near, one far,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.870
and one somewhere in between, then
place entrances even further away.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:39.130
I'll set up the entrances in groups of three,
in locations where the palace is within sight.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.380
When the mission starts, we can enter
by the most convenient location.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.250
Once it's time to act,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.360
the situation will determine
whether we approach

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.990
by the near exit, the far exit,
or the one in between.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.970
Once that has been determined, we act.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.190
From the enemy's perspective,
we will be appearing from nowhere.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.430
We must use that opening to separate
the King and Royal Guard.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.290
That is when our battles will begin!

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.830
It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.240
so long as the King is their one loss.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.060
Under normal circumstances,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.380
<i>I would already be within
range of Neferpitou's</i> En.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.860
This is quite tense...

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.360
However, I am still far away.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.310
The farthest exit

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.910
must be on the palace grounds,
or it won't be any use to us!

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.500
Advance carefully, but swiftly!

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.320
Should I wait for the sun to set?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.630
But, will this scenario hold out until then?

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.620
I have no choice...

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.850
<i>Should Neferpitou's</i> En <i>return,</i>

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.770
approaching the palace will be impossible.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.440
If I fail, we still have other options!

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.480
I have nothing to fear.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.170
Advance...

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.050
Advance...

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.320
In the palace,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.950
there are three humans not intended as food.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.460
The first is the Gungi player.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.330
The second is Diego.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.430
And the third...

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.390
is Secretary Bizeff.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.200
Behind the scenes, he was
the country's true ruler.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.990
All dealings with foreign parties
and domestic organizations

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.440
went through him as an intermediary.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.750
Since he cannot be replaced,

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:26.110
he is the only human allowed near the King.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.350
No human guards are posted near the palace.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.460
Because ordinary soldiers would
be powerless against <i>Nen</i> users,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.480
the Royal Guard determined that the
presence of ordinary soldiers would,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.550
in fact, increase the risk of infiltration.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.900
The only Squadron Leader present
is Cheetu, who has just returned.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.960
There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.010
In other words,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:03.790
there are currently only three humans
and eleven Ants in the palace.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.750
The Soldier Ants are

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.410
the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.050
Thus, they are not involved
in the King's protection.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.630
Essentially, the Squadron Leaders

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.140
no longer have any strict fealty to the King.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.140
They work together simply
because their goals align.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.000
Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.250
have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks
that are expected to end in failure.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.160
Hence, they would not be trusted
with monitoring the palace.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.880
However, Knov does not know this.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.890
As he attempts to infiltrate the palace,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.030
he has no idea that this is
his best, and last, chance.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.680
I managed to survive somehow...

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.220
But on my own, I can only work so much.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.690
I must convince them

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.050
to at least provide three more
staffers to do secretarial duties...

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.990
Otherwise, I'll die of overwork.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.960
Sending list of available bodies.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.340
"Thinker...

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.750
Bell."

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.760
Per our arrangement,
I request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.280
This is it.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.780
He took the bait, Palm-kun!

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.540
While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.710
Palm is preparing to launch
her own infiltration plan.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.640
Next time: Knov x And x Morel.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.050
Today, this person is joining me!

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.310
Why am I here?

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.650
Because Killua isn't around!

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:28.260
Scream.
