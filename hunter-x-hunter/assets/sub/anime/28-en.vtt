WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
Heavens Arena.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.990
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.530
When combatants win a fight,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.420
they may advance by one class,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.460
and receive a corresponding reward.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.030
After reaching the 100th floor,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.170
you are assigned a private room.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.600
After reaching the 200th floor,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.010
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.880
This is the best stage

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.890
a warrior could ask for.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.270
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.980
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.650
I'll agree to the full learning process

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.650
rather than a quick explanation!

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.160
I understand.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Nen x And x <i>Nen</i>

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.420
After Killua fought Zushi,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.300
the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.500
Zushi mentioned the four major principles.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.600
Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.250
of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.900
Do I have your attention?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.940
Nen means to burn your own soul.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.310
In other words,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.260
it tests your strength of will.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.320
Burn

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320
Nen

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.340
And the four major principles are part

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.820
of a training curriculum for
strengthening your will.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.010
Strengthening your will?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.110
Training?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.700
That's correct.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.290
Ten

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.580
Focus

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.920
Ten means to focus your soul to a single point,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.510
to increase awareness of your ego and goals.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.500
Express

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.210
Zetsu

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.540
Zetsu means to express yourself in words.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.090
Temper

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.670
Ren

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.690
Ren means to temper that will.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.470
Act

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.130
Hatsu

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.470
And Hatsu means to act upon that will.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.100 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.310
Ten.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.180
Zetsu.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.070
Ren.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.260
Hatsu.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.100
Those are the four major principles.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.600
Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his "refusal
to lose," during his fight with you.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.230
So, allow me to demonstrate.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.120
Killua-kun...

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.310
I think I'm going to kill you now.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.330
Are you ready?

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.710
Yeah, sure.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.630
It's not happening.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.380
Then I'll take this step-by-step.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.380
First comes Ten.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.270
I focus my soul into a single point.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.810
Zetsu.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.890
You can express yourself mentally or verbally.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.400
I will kill you.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.110
That was Ren.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.700
If I temper my will enough,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.950
then I can act. Hatsu.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.210
If your will is strong enough,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.600
you can make your opponent back down,
without moving a muscle.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.010
The concept of bluffing derives from this.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.920
Ren hardens that which is soft,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.170
and you lose the ability to
correct an incorrect idea.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.360
Therefore, you should avoid using Ren

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.390
until your soul has fully matured.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.560
Right now, you boys and Zushi
should be training your souls.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.880
Let's go, Gon.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.180
If you wish to learn about Nen,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.450
you should focus on mastering Ten.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.990
If you master Ten,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.960
you will no longer feel the pressure
of an opponent's will.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.400
Thank you very much!

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.850
Wait up, Killua!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.720
Zushi.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.480
Yes, sir.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.690
Let's begin training.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.840
O-Osu!

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.380
First...

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.600
He was lying?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.920
Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.490
and Wing is clearly very strong.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.510
But his story had holes.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.240
Huh?

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.470
Zushi's toughness.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.620
He kept getting up after
I knocked him down.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.800
I was getting irritated,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.920
so I used all of my strength
during my last attack.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.630
Brat!

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.480
Crap!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.870
He flew out of the ring!

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.000
Even an amateur can see that
he's headed for the hospital!

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.110
Oh! He stood back up.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.020
Zushi must be invincible.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.550
Impossible.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.430
However, the referee has awarded
a critical hit and knockdown.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.390
Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.050
Willpower didn't keep him standing.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.680
He's hiding some other secret.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.200
What's wrong, Zushi?

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.450
Your Ten is unstable.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.670
Master...

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.450
Hmm?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.460
Why did you lie to them?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.740
Lie?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.060
You mean my explanation?

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.090
Yes!

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.830
The four major principles are
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.090
But they don't mean what you said.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.350
Did you lie because they aren't your students?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.600
I didn't lie.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.750
<i>Nen</i> is an important method
for training your soul.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.360 position:20% line:50%
Force

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.800
However, it's true that I can't teach <i>Nen</i>

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.340
to someone who is not a student.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.060
So I used the other Nen as a hint,
to help them along.

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.000
If <i>Nen</i> is used the wrong way,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.250
it can become a terrible weapon.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.930
For example...

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.790
You could turn a piece of paper
into a blade to harm others,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.290
while hardening your body,
as a defensive measure.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.690
With enough work, anyone can use <i>Nen</i>.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.340
That is why

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.940
you must be careful when
deciding to teach it.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.170
Master...

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.430
I didn't

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.610
have a chance to read that book yet...

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.800
And that can of juice was mine...

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.010
S-Sorry...

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.730
It's time for the day's biggest match!

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.800
The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.210
to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.220
Will they be able to keep moving on?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.090
Okay, everyone...

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.860
Get ready to press your gamble switches!

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.600
Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.350
That's because

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.310
I am as slippery as a snake,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.360
with sharp fangs,
to bite at your vital points.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.440
You may sport a vicious chop,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.770
but you can't overcome these muscles!

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.170
That's because...

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.750
I'm totally ripped!

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.880
Begin!

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.460
Critical hit and knockdown...

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.700
Three points.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.360
Knockout!

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.330
The winner is Gon!

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.780
Critical hit and knockdown...

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.960
Three points.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.420
Knockout!

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.710
The winner is Killua!

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.360
Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked
out their opponents with one attack.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.820
And both of them have
successfully cleared the 190s!

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.850
Both have advanced to the 200s!

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.670
They've already reached the 200s?!

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.690
Zushi.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.030
Master!

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.160
Killua-kun and Gon-kun have
already reached the 200s?

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.870
Yes, they're amazing!

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.900
I need to train more...

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.960
Huh?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.350
Master?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.640
I have no choice.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.930
Enjoy.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.870
What's the 200th floor like?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.980
Beats me.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.030
I've never been up here before.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.470
Wow!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.600
The 200th floor is so fancy!

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.050
Where's the receptionist?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.270
This way?

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.510
We finally made it.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.430
Yeah.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.000
What is this?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.550
All of a sudden, it feels like
we're in a monster-filled jungle.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.430
But this is an ordinary hallway.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.830
Let's go.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.990
We can do this!

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.790
This isn't working...

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.390
I can't move forward!

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.900
I don't want to move forward...

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.990
This is murderous intent,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.490
aimed at us.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.050
Hey! Who's there?

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.500
Show yourself!

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.230
Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.140
The receptionist's desk is over here,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.890
so please register for a 200s match today.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.610
You won't be able to register

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.760
after midnight, so please be careful.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.850
Was she the source of all that?

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.650
I can't tell.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.920
By the way, there are currently

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.250
one hundred, seventy-three
contestants in the 200s class.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.150
And starting from the 200s,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.940
all weapons are allowed in matches.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.920
So please use whatever you have.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.300
Also, you will no longer receive
prize money in the 200s class.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.530
You will fight only for glory,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.060
so please understand that
if you're going to participate.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.840
Huh?!

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.550
H-Hisoka...

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.960
Why are you here?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.990
It's hardly that strange.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.660
I love to fight,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.130
and this is a temple to fighting.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.100
And why are you here?

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.310
Just kidding...

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.610
This was no coincidence.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.520
I've been waiting for you.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.860
Remember how you ordered airship
tickets over the cybernet?

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.250
With a little effort,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.660
it's possible to determine where
and when someone will arrive.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.690
Well,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.070
I knew you would come here eventually.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.620
And so,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.130
as a veteran, I have a warning for you.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.260
It's still too early for you boys

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.760
to step on this floor.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.210
How early depends on your efforts.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.270
Leave for now.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.740
It's too early right now.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.030
That's stupid!

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.810
We just got up here...

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.690
I won't let you pass.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.080
Not that you could, anyway.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.040
Wh-What is...

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.790
...this?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.860
Don't be reckless!

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.970
Wing-san!

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.440
You have no defense

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.170
against his <i>Nen</i>.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.070
Nen?

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.400
Right now, you are like someone standing

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.450
naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.730
If you continue to strain
your body, you may die.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.350
This is Nen?!

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.710
He can stop us from moving
forward through willpower?

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.230
Don't lie!

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.210
Yes, I was lying.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.720
Though technically, I wasn't lying completely.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.570
I will teach you the truth about <i>Nen</i>.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.850
So retreat for now.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.640
Hey, receptionist lady.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.040
Oh, yes?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.850
What happens if we don't register
for a fight today?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.620
Gon-sama, you would have to
start again, from the first floor.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.240
However, Killua-sama

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.880
refused to register once before.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.550
So if he fails to register again,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.490
his commitment will be questioned,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.250
and he will be banned from participating.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.380
Hey, Wing-san.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.630
If we back down now,

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.380
will we be able to return here

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.750
by midnight?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.020
That depends on you.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.530
Simply put,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.070
this is <i>Nen</i>.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.950
<i>Nen</i> refers to the ability

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.160
to manipulate your aura,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.160
Force

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.160
Nen

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.160
also known as life energy.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.920
Every person possesses a
small amount of life energy.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.670
But in most cases, it's simply discharged.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.410
The ability to build up

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.430
a shroud of life energy is known as <i>Ten</i>.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.430
Shroud

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.670
You can make your body harder,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:27.250
Shroud

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:27.250
Ten

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.620
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.210
Then comes <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.170
Null

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.170
Zetsu

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.710
As you may guess, this nullifies your aura.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.070
It is effective for

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.450
concealing your presence,
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.140
Which brings us to <i>Ren</i>.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.080
Enhance

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.200
Ren

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.830
A technique to create an especially strong aura.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.840
Can you feel that?

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.020
Yeah, I can feel the pressure.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.680
But it doesn't feel dangerous.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.690
That's because I have no hostile intent.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.300
However, I must admit I am
impressed by their senses.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.910
Perhaps it's because of
how they've grown up.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.710
But their natural potential is
also a major factor.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.360
Aura is an energy that comes
from within humans.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.500
Which makes it very effective
against other humans.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.500
For better or worse.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.870
If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.880
you can use aura to kill.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.840
Only one thing can protect you

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.510
from someone who uses <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.550
You must also learn to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.130
You must use <i>Ten</i> for defense.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.270
Block the other person's aura with your own.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.490
Otherwise...

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.050
Your body will be crushed.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.090
Hisoka blocks the path leading
beyond the 200th floor.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.410
Will Gon and Killua be able

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.690
to learn enough about

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.810
true <i>Nen </i>to pass Hisoka,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.410
and reach the receptionist,
before the clock strikes midnight?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.660
It's too early.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.870
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:59.710
and Killua's

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.330
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.490
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.390
and Killua's

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.000
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:14.580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.030
Today, we introduce Wing-san!

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.200
Master of Shingen-ryu.
Zushi's teacher.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.210
He's Zushi's teacher!

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.000
And a master of Shingen-ryu!

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.160
Very serious about teaching <i>Nen</i>,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.770
Seems he's pretty good with <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.850
but sloppy about everything else.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.740
Oh, Wing-san's shirt isn't tucked in.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.870
And his hair's a mess!

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.260
Next time: Awakening x And x Potential!

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.720
Did you feel anything?

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.400
Nope, nothing.
