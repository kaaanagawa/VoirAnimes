WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.960
Meruem... That is your name.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.250
What is this?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.370
Meruem, King of Ants,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.210
you understand nothing...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.150
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.360
I see now...

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.520
Yes... I see...

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.830
You had me in checkmate

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.330
from the start...

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.030
Hostility x And x Determination

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.860
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.300
while also proving surprisingly lethal.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.300
With the right technology,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.490
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.660
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.580
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.160
and was popular with small dictatorships.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.410
In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.830
ten times as many roses had bloomed,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.540
consuming 5.12 million human lives.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.580
After terrorists used the bomb in the
center of an adversarial nation's capital,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.020
taking more than 110,000 lives,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.410
an international treaty was signed that
banned the bomb's production.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.420
However, over eighty percent of the
world's countries rejected the proposal

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.420
to discard and ban the use of
roses they had already produced,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.920
meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.790
still wait silently in many countries
for their chance to bloom.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.240
"How are humans and Ants different?"

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.690
When Netero decided to use his last resort,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.290
could this thought have crossed his mind?

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.880
Now, there is no way to find out.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.010
The two immediately understood

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.720
what the distant cloud of smoke and
resulting vibration in the air signified.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.730
At the same time,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.220
Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.320
After his experience with Youpi,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.600
Knuckle hoped to reach a
similar understanding with Pouf.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.390
But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.660
If the King waves his baton,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.870
the soldiers will become demons if necessary.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.280
Pouf's main body must have learned
that something happened to the King.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.790
That led to the transformation of the clone's
face, revealing the Ants' true nature.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.910
Did the chairman defeat the King?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.300
No, it doesn't matter either way...

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.920
In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier
that could not be overcome.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.610
It's destroyed!

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.530
Is everyone okay?

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.950
This is brutal...

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.320
It only took them thirty minutes
to wreck the whole place.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.140
That was close...

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.200
Ikalgo.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.190
Killua!

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.460
Palm...

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.010
I see.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.910
But I'm glad to see you.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.480
You returned to us.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.040
Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.450
No, she wants to stay.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.170
Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.730
In terms of raw offensive power,
she has me beat...

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.080
Probably.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.250
To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.930
However...

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.800
I'll wait.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.380
I'll respect his wishes...

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.170
His wishes?

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.350
He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.870
I'll wait right here for one hour.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.550
And once he's made up his mind,
that's it. He won't budge.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.610
In return, he performs his best

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.160
when circumstances are as expected.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.390
Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.230
B-But what if...

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.170
Yeah, I know.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.890
If he gets into serious trouble,
we'll immediately rush in to help him.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.360
I see...

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.250
So that's why they're staying behind.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.290
Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.180
he still won't be able to beat Pitou.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.630
In fact, even if the three of us join him,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.350
they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.300
They're staying behind

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.740
to die with him!

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.600
We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.220
Want to come?

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.220
Absolutely.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.430
Okay, let's go.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.930
We separated the King and the Royal Guard

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.360
to let the chairman defeat the King.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.370
As Knov-san said, we've completed
the mission we were assigned.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.370
Each of us will have to decide
where we go from here.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.130
Do we stop or keep going?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.510
I am

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.390
going to keep fighting them.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.390
I've already laid down my life here more than once.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.300
Even if we can't reach an understanding,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.020
I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.990
You're finished.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.810
Why did he say that?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.010
There's still time left...

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.320
Did he notice that my surgery was done?

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.770
I made sure to hide my progress from him.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.650
But if I showed any sign of
relaxing after finishing it,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.380
and he noticed that...

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.990
I must kill him.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.910
No matter the cost!

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.690
I must kill him...

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.560
For the King's sake!

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.910
Did he notice my bloodlust then?

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.920
Stand up.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.770
We move to Peijing now.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.480
Running is faster for us.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.610
What happened to me?

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.210
I would like to—

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.590
The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.350
S-Sorry!

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.100
Am I interrupting something?

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.100
U-Um, I don't understand what's going on...

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.000
I understand.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.610
Let's go.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.120
Pitou was close enough to take
off his head with one arm.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.410
But Pitou couldn't move.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.790
After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.060
Pitou's instincts said to obey.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.880
I can't make a move now...

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.450
My chance will come.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.210
There'll be many, on our way to Peijing.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.650
But I must get Komugi to the King!

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.330
Gon, want me to use Chapter 7
Bankruptcy on Pitou?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.390
If there's an escape attempt,
I can track Pitou down.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.310
And if Pitou tries to fight back,
APR will protect you.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.600
Thank you, Knuckle.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.740
But it's okay.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.350
I trust Pitou...

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.110
So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.360
keep an eye on her.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.620
A-Are you talking about me?

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.680
Is he going to use Komugi...

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.010
As a hostage?!

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.520
Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.530
I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.450
Pitou?

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.550
You sure about this, Killua?

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.310
You aren't going with Gon?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.280
We were...

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.120
No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.070
But Gon didn't want him to come!

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.780
Pitou and I will go by ourselves.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.070
It's okay.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.260
That was always the plan.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.870
And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.660
You mean the hostage?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.440
Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.650
and Pitou managed to capture me.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.240
Then Pitou would have the option
to exchange hostages.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.000
Seriously...

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.480
What have they been through for
their minds to work this way?

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.980
It's all right.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.690
Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.360
I'll know immediately if something happens.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.490
Besides, Pitou won't abandon her.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.990
Which means that Gon is safe.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.000
I can't understand what's going on.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.990
Where is the Supreme Leader?

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.200
Who are these people?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.310
The heat of the explosion had
melted the rock into magma,

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.240
leaving a scene resembling the
mouth of an active volcano,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.330
producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.300
that prevented the living from entering.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.810
Pouf!

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.410
I'll search inside, so I need you to
search the surrounding area.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.430
It's possible that the explosion
sent the King flying.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.490
I was wrong...

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.830
We will kill them all, with the King at our side.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.200
None will be spared!

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.640
Your Majesty!

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.940
Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.480
Before he could even see the truth for himself,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.950
tears were already streaming down Pouf's face.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.800
Your Majesty!

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.210
Your Majesty!

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.500
Next time:

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.340
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.050
I never ask for anything in return.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.800
Isn't that unconditional love?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.680
Unparalleled joy.
