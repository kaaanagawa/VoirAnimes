00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.040
In the Dentora region

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.300
of the Republic of Padokea,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.300
Kukuroo Mountain.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.520
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.010
Lamentation Tours

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.240
I understand.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.430
You're free now.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.840
But...

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060
Promise me one thing.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.230
Never betray your friends.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.980
Understand?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.490
I promise.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.450
I'll never betray them.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.570
Never.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.580
Can't See x If x You're Blind

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.750
After a discussion with the father he admires,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.050
Killua leaves his home again,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.590
despite his mother's objections.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.380
Gon and his friends are led by Canary

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.000
to the butler's office,
to attempt to meet with Killua.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.480
Aren't we there yet?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.300
We still have a while to go.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.780
How much walking do we have to do...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.850
Honestly, I cannot believe this!

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.000
Kil was finally home!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.630
But the men allowed him to leave again!

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.110
And Father is just as guilty!

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.920
He released Kil without permission!

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920
Really,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.150
this always happens!

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.430
They never ask me before they act.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.750
Do you understand, Gotoh?

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.250
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.060
Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150
Why don't they understand?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.270
He's the one child I shall not give up!

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.940
There it is.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.460
That building?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.270
But it's still pretty far away.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.980
Say, Canary.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.550
Won't you get in trouble
for bringing us here?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.720
They already know what I'm doing.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.210
So I am prepared to take the consequences.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.100
If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.840
No.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.610
I'm merely serving as a guide
for Killua-sama's friends.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.000
Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.750
Gotoh, where's Gon now?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.520
You do know, right?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.760
Canary is bringing Gon-sama here,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.550
along with his two friends.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.260
Really?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.020
They should arrive shortly,
so please wait inside.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.140
Okay.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.150
Gotoh.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.900
Yes, sir.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.390
Let me know the second Gon gets here.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.540
Yes, sir.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.290
I shall notify you immediately.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.420
Forgive me, Killua-sama.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.920
Hey, we finally made it.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.050
Welcome.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.440
Please forgive the rude reception.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.820
The lady of the house has
asked us to treat you

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.290
as official guests.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480
Is that better?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.950
Thanks.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.800
Then this is not the primary residence?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.210
No, this place is for the butlers.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.470
Well, please make yourselves at home.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.040
I appreciate the hospitality,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.350
but we've come to see Killua.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.190
Can you take us to him at once?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.730
That won't be necessary.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.730
Killua-sama is on his way here.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.030
Really?

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.860
Yes, so please wait a little longer.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.560
That's great news, Gon!

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.470
Yeah!

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.120
Now, then...

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.620
To simply sit and wait would be dull.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.500
How about a game, to pass the time?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.000
A game?

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.390
Which hand holds the coin?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.640
The left hand.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.900
Correct.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.000
So I'll move more quickly this time.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.570
Well? Which hand?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.320
Left again.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.060
Marvelous.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.840
Then I shall try harder this time.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.960
Well? Which hand?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.440
I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.210
You see...

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.730
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.720
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.720
In all honesty,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.600
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.610
Well? Which hand?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.610
Answer.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.610
The left hand.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.110
His lady mother could barely speak...

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.880
She must be heartbroken,
having to watch him leave.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.880
I cannot forgive it.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.630
By the time Killua-sama arrives,
a decision will be reached.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.880
I shall test you in my own way.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.010
You have no choice.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.540
Canary!

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.230
This is her punishment for having
brought you here, against her orders.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.730
I shall explain the rules.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.790
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.370
Should you all be disqualified,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.940
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.250
And that he will never see you again.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.230
Killua is...

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.500
Silence!

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.290
Your lives hang by a thread.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.730
Now, answer my question.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.640
Which hand?

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.400
I couldn't see it...

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.920
Don't take too long.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.780
You have three seconds to answer.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.300
Hey...

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.880
After three seconds have passed,
slit her throat.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.660
Okay.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.670
Wait! Left hand!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.900
I pick the right hand!

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.960
Me, too!

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.880
One disqualified.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.300
This is futile.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.760
I can't see anything!

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.140
Which hand?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.640
I choose the right hand.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.900
I pick the left.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.630
It was in my left hand.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.400
Only one remains now.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.350
Here I go.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.370
One second!

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.110
What is it?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.210
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.540
Leorio, lend me your knife.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.210
Huh?

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.780
Don't worry.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.890
I won't use it for anything stupid.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.880
That's it...

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.520
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.230
Man, how long do I have to wait?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.480
Hey, Gotoh!

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.240
Anyone around?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.980
What's going on?

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.610
Okay!

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.830
Now I can see.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.000
Give me your best!

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.460
Which hand?

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.090
Left hand.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.950
Not bad.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.910
In that case...

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.060
Who now holds the coin?

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:20.160
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.160
Waiting Time

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.290
The person right behind me.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.110
Brilliant.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.030
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.700
Killua!

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.920
Oh! You're here, Gon!

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.500
Along with...

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.420
Kurapika?

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.940
I'm just an afterthought?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.050
Liorio!

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.530
Leorio!

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.550
It's been a while.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.830
I can't believe you came.
What happened?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.080
Your face is a wreck!

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.200
Yours isn't any better!

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.690
Hey, Gotoh.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.500
I told you to let me know
as soon as they arrived.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.850
What were you doing?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.700
Forgive me.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.720
I had them participate in a little game.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.230
A game?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.290
It was nothing more than a poor joke.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.600
I apologize for any aggravation.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.800
Did you enjoy yourselves?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.720
That was really good acting...

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.110
What? Did they try something?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.490
No, they were entertaining us.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.640
Really?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.850
Well, whatever.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.010
Anyway, let's go somewhere else.
Anywhere else, right now.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.910
If we stay here, my mother
will give us an earful!

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.620
Yeah!

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.830
Hey, Gotoh.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.800
Listen up.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.630
I don't care what Mother says.
Don't follow me.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.380
Understood. Please take care.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.950
Gon, let's go.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.590
Bye.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.100
Gotoh-san.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.680
Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.110
No.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.900
We butlers feel no emotional attachment

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.610
to our employers.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.730
You're lying.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.120
Gon-kun...

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.500
Well? Which hand?

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.380
Isn't it your left hand?

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.870
What? No way!

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.630
Indeed. It was a deception.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.640
In this world, there are many
things that are wrong.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.640
Please be careful.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.900
I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.150
Bye, Canary!

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.530
Took you long enough, Gon!

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.850
Sorry about that.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.800
Let's make ourselves scarce
before more trouble comes.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.920
Yeah, he's used that trick on me before.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.590
Once you know the secret,
it's so simple, it'll make you mad.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.380
Huh? Really?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.840
I'm assuming this was what he did.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.390
Which hand?

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.430
It's your left hand, right?

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.390
Huh? How?

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.930
Hey, how did you do that?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.060
Gotoh held two coins.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.390
Huh? But he only had the one.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.520
Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.820
while flipping the other.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.680
And then he let us see him grab
the coin using his left hand.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.300
But before he asked us
which hand held the coin,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.000
he raised both arms,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.500
and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.110
That left the coin in his right hand.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.170
You got it.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.140
That really makes me mad.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.540
Well, I'm fairly certain he only used
the trick on the final turn.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.260
Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.100
That's even worse!

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.900
What?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.800
You're here on a tourist visa?

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.530
Uh-huh.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.980
Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.230
You could've just used your Hunter License.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.120
It lets you stay in other countries
for as long as you want.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.670
That's what we said.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.080
I already decided.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.170
I'm not using the license until I've
finished what I need to do.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.870
What do you have to do?

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.680
The tag

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.310
that Hisoka gave me!

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.170
I'll only take it back

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.940
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.450
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.450
I'll return it to Hisoka when
I punch him in the face!

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.320
Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.280
I can't go back to Whale Island, either.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.470
Hmm...

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.230
So, where's Hisoka?

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.540
Uh...

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.420
Thought so...

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.720
I know where he is, Gon.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.340
Huh? Really?

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.130
How?

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.850
He told me.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.230
So that's what he said...

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.980
No, this was after the orientation.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.260
But it's still related, right?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.480
I suppose so.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.420
I've been itching to ask...

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.860
What did Hisoka say to you?

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.370
He told me...

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.540
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.170
The Phantom Troupe?

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.580
I do not recall mentioning the
Phantom Troupe to Hisoka.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.100
So either he overheard our conversation
during the first stage,

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.680
or he heard of it from another.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.070
The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol,

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.560
so those familiar with the organization
refer to the Troupe as such.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.560
I was interested in his information.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.520
I see...

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.030
So that's why you swallowed your pride

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.570
and accepted Hisoka's surrender.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.070
After the orientation, I asked him about it.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.620
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.000
September 1st?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.590
Then you've still got over half a year.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.230
What's going to happen in Yorknew City?

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.250
They'll hold the world's largest auction.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.710
Correct.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.390
From September 1st through September 10th,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.740
there will be an auction

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.600
for unusual items, rare goods,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.760
and national treasures from around the world.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.090
The event attracts all manner of nasty folk

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.730
who come looking to satisfy their greed.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.520
It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.570
So the Troupe will be there?

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.490
They're a group of bandits.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.530
They would not let this chance escape.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.540
So on that day, Hisoka will be
somewhere in Yorknew City.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.440
Okay. September 1st.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.540
Got it. Thanks.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.900
Then I shall depart now.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.550
Huh?

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.720
We managed to see Killua again,
so I'm finished here.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.440
I'll need money to participate in the auction.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.940
So I shall search for a patron
to employ me as a Hunter.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.320
Really...

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.790
I guess I should go home, then.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.820
You, too?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.940
I haven't given up my dream
of becoming a doctor.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.660
If I'm accepted to medical school,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.700
I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.000
I'll have to go back and start cramming.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.010
Uh-huh, good luck.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.370
Until we meet again.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.340
Yes, that will be...

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.350
September 1st, in Yorknew City.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.700
See ya.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.350
Bye-bye!

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.880
It's just the two of us now.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.680
Hey, what do you want to do?

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.490
You have to ask? We train, obviously.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.350
Huh? Train for what?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.550
Shouldn't we have some fun?

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.000
Do you remember what you just said?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.500
Think you can punch Hisoka in
the face without training?

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.500
You couldn't land a punch

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.600
in ten years, let alone six months!

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.900
Okay.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.930
Here, I'll make it easy to understand.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.300
This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.260
Uh-huh...

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.820
If this is the gap between Hisoka
and Hanzo, in terms of strength,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.420
the gap between Hisoka and you

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.640
is this far!

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.330
And I'm being generous.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.400
Now I'm mad...

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.730
Then where are you?

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.800
Me?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.090
Well, probably around here.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.720
Yep... I'm so humble.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.420
Oh, Hanzo is stronger?

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.850
What is it?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.700
You really are amazing!

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.050
Cut that out... It's embarrassing.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.210
I don't know how to tell the
difference in strength

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.730
between my opponent and myself.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.010
Stupid. It doesn't matter.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.810
I'm only estimating.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.810
You probably have a general idea.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.680
Once you have enough experience,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.120
your guess will become more accurate.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.800
Besides, the stronger someone is,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.960
the better they are at hiding that strength.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.780
So you shouldn't rely on this method.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.320
Oh...

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.500
Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.200
Yeah.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.580
You won't land a blow on him in six
months through normal means.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.790
Gon, do you have any money?

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.850
Actually, I'm running out.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.510
I don't have much, either.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.470
But there's somewhere we can train and
earn money at the same time.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.350
Train and earn money?

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.100
The Heavens Arena.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.560
Heavens Arena...

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.060
Yeah, I'll explain later.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.780
We should get moving.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.050
Okay!

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.730
After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio,

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.430
with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.500
Gon and Killua now head to a new stage,
the Heavens Arena.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.830
Next time: Then x And x After!

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.820
I like sweet and spicy.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.400
I like salty and spicy.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.570
Spicy is good for you!
