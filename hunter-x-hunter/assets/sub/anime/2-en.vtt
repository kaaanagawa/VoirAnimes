Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.760
Okay!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.400
I'll take responsibility for bringing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.210
you three to the port closest to the exam site.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.120
Yay!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.610

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.970 line:20%
Dolle Harbor

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860
After winning the captain's favor,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.370
the trio of Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.870
arrived safely at Dolle Harbor.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.620
Thanks, Captain!

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.110
I had a great time!

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.250
I had fun, too.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.120
Right! As a token of my appreciation,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.760
I'll give you some advice.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.200
Advice?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.370
Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.390
Uh-huh.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.930
You should make your way there first.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.270
It's a shortcut to the exam site.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.520
A shortcut?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.530
Got it!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.280
So, I just need to head for that tree!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.090
I'll do that, Captain!

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.280
Thanks!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.780
Best of luck!

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.020
Yep! Same to you!

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.120
Take care!

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.490
<i>Rest easy, Ging.</i>

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.920
<i>Your son has grown into a respectable young man.</i>

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.320
Huh... That's strange.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.310
Why?

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.680
According to the notice I received,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.510
the exam is supposedly being held
somewhere in Zaban City.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.020
Right now, we're here.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.020
That tree is in the opposite direction.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.190
Perhaps you misheard him?

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.080
No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.400
I see...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.940
And this notice isn't any help!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.040
Where, exactly, in Zaban City
are we meant to go?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.140
Our task is to find the exam site,
using a limited amount of information.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.240
Just another test before we'll be allowed
to take the Hunter Exam.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.590
I-I knew that...

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.800
I already knew that!

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.230
Anyway, I'll go have a look.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.430
The captain must have had
a reason to suggest that.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.410
Hey, hey...

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.300
You're serious?

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.520
The bus to Zaban is about to leave.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.290
We should just take it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.440
Hey!

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.180
Man...

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.430
He's gotta learn that you
can't trust everyone.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.410
Huh?

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.260
Hey!

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.190
Kurapika!

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.950
Gon's behavior interests me more
than the captain's advice.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.710
I'm going with him.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.430
Oh, is that so?

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.490
See ya.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.960
Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.710
Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.070
I'm just gonna take the bus!

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.590
So it was a trap...

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.350
Seems none of the buses have
made it to Zaban City.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.510
Rookies usually fail this part
because they're too naïve.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.100
Wait, wait, wait!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.850
Wait for me!

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.120
Well, I knew you guys would
be lonely without me.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.260
And it's no fun traveling alone.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.090
So I decided to stick with you
guys a while longer.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.990
This is a creepy place...

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.050
I don't see a single person.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.910
No, there are plenty here.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.300
What?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.940
Wh-What's with the freak show?

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.450
Exciting...

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.450
E-Exciting?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.950
Exciting...

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.110
Exciting.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.960
Exciting two-choice quiz!

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.470
You boys are headed for that
tree on the hill, correct?

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.910
To reach that tree,

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.110
you must pass through this town.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.980
Huh?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.410
I shall administer a single-question quiz.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.680
H-Hold on!

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.270
What's going on here?

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.740
You'll have five seconds to state your answer.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.610
Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.740
You'll have to give up on taking
this year's Hunter Exam.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.360
I see...

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.570
Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.220
I see how it is.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.110
I happen to be a quiz expert.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.500
Wait. Only one question?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.770
Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.010
Any other answer will be considered incorrect.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.780
Hold on!

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.860
All three of us share one question?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.270
So if one of them answers incorrectly,
I'm disqualified, too?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.110
As if that would happen!

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.550
What scares me is the high likelihood
of the vice versa happening.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.590
What was that?

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.590
But you know...

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.770
This way's easier, since only one of us
needs to know the answer.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.880
I'm not good at quizzes.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.590
I suppose...

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.460
Fair point.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.660
Hey, there. Hurry it up.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.450
Or else I'll answer the question first.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.990
Who are you?

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.880
He followed us here, all the way from port.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.460
Huh? Seriously?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.280
Sorry, kid.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.720
I happened to overhear your conversation.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.430
What will you do?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.310
He seems eager to take it.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.760
We should let him go first.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.930
That way, we'll know what kind
of question to expect.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.570
I don't mind.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.900
I have no objection.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.480
Then I'll get to it.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.020
<i>Fools.</i>

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.230
<i>I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.</i>

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.820
Here is your question...

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.050
Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.400
You can only save one.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.500
Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.120
Which will you save?

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.290
H-How is this even a quiz?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.550
The answer is 1.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.300
Oh? Why do you say that?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.990
Because you can't replace your mother.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.590
But you can find another lover.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.560
What?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.820
You may pass.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.070
What?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.700
You just have to tell the old lady
what she wants to hear.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.200
Adios.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.780
Hey, now! That's all bull!

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.950
How was that the right answer?

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.960
We're supposed to give the answer
the old lady wants?

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.210
And that's considered correct?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.360
Hey, say something!

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.050
I won't put up with this sham.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.680
I'll find a different route.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.830
It's too late.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.470
Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.080
Th-That's just ridiculous!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.960
Different people would expect different answers!

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.230
There is no right answer!

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.180
No right answer...

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.990
I see!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.990
Leorio!

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.990
Wait!

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.490
<i>The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.</i>

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.310
Not another word from you.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.340
Say anything but the answer,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.000
and you're immediately disqualified.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.520
<i>Wake up, Leorio...</i>

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.780
<i>It's a simple trick...</i>

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.010
<i>Gon...</i>

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.230
Here is your question...

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.800
Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.610
You can only rescue one.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.770
Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.500
Which will you rescue?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.030
<i>She's making fun of us...</i>

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.470
Five.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.160
<i>Go ahead and count down, you hag.</i>

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.270
Four.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.130
Three.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.170
Two.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.210
One.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.750
Buzz. Time's up.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.020
Don't stop me, Kurapika!

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.690
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.190
Calm down, Leorio!

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.880
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.490
You'll waste our correct response.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.240
Correct response?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.930
We gave the right answer.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.000
Silence was the correct response.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.530
Silence? What do you mean...

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.240
You hit the nail on the head.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.760
<i>There is no right answer!</i>

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.810
Precisely.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.040
This quiz had no right answer.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.390
However, we could only state
1 or 2 as the answer.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.070
In other words, we weren't meant
to respond at all.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.770
Silence was the only response.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.840
But what about that other guy?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.600
They never said he gave the right answer.
She only said, "You may pass."

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.280
In other words, this path is the wrong path.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.460
Am I right?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.250
Precisely.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.960
The correct path is over here.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.530
This leads directly to the tree.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.290
Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.290
Oh, so that's what this was about...

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.430
A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.050
They serve as Navigators.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.060
If you meet their standards, I believe that
they will guide you to the exam site.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.900
Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.190
Don't be. I don't mind.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.610
I do this job because I enjoy
meeting people like you.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.700
Huh?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.950
Do your best to become a good Hunter.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.210
It's no use. I can't think of an answer.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.680
You were still trying to find an answer?

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.700
You can stop.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.360
Huh? Why?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.440
The quiz is over.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.260
I know.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:27.980
But...

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.580
But you know...

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.490
What if I run into a situation like that

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.040
and I can only save one person...

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.490
What should I do then?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.490
It wouldn't be right to choose just one...

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:47.250
But one day, I might have
to make that choice.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.640
<i>That's right.</i>

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.460
<i>That is the true purpose of this test.</i>

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.720
<i>You must be prepared to face the
worst possible scenarios...</i>

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.590
<i>Because harsh reality strikes without warning.</i>

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.880
<i>You must be prepared for
the day your paths diverge.</i>

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:24.070
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.070
Kurapika

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.740
It's totally dark out...

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.260
"Walk two hours," she said?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.650
It was two hours, two hours ago!

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.750
Damn.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.750 line:20%
Beware of Magical Beasts!

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.160
Another "Beware of Magical Beasts" sign?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.630
Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.540
I'm hungry!

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.260
I need to take a dump!

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.260
Leorio!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.640
We'll leave you behind!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.490
I've gotta take a leak, too!

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.280
I see it.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.890
Hey!

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.900
Hello? Anyone home?

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.260
Are they out?

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.970
We're coming in.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.980
It's a Magical Beast!

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.790
A Magical Beast?

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.720
A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.290
They can take human form!

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.550
That's an extremely intelligent creature!

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.220
There's a woman in his arms!

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.510
And the guy on the floor
needs medical attention...

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.600
P-Please...

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.140
Please save my wife...

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.740
Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.900
Got it!

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.120
<i>He can follow that faint shadow,
even through this dark forest.</i>

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.040
<i>Impressive.</i>

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.880
Kiriko! Let her go!

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.860
Take her from me, if you can!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.070
Wow! He can talk!

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.240
That Magical Beast,
the Kiriko, uses human speech.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.320
Oh. That makes this a lot easier!

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.110
Hey! Silly Kiriko!

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.980
What?

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.360
<i>H-He's fast!</i>

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.070
Kurapika!

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.200
He's so reckless...

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.120
Stupid kid.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.410
You'll pay for this!

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.210
Wait!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.880
Are you okay?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.970
Are you injured anywhere?

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.440
I'm okay.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.880
What about my husband?

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.970
How is he?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.420
Don't worry.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.230
Our friend is taking care of him.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.980
Please take me to my husband!

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.730
Those tattoos...

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.870
You're...

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.780
Kurapika!

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.960
You okay?

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.990
Leorio?

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.850
Whew... Guess you guys are all right.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.740
How is that man?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.310
Yeah, no worries.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.110
The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.780
I gave him some painkillers,
and he's sound asleep in the cabin.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.710
I see...

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.260
How did you know?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.230
How did you know I was an impostor?

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.540
I didn't think that you were.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.160
I told Leorio to take care of the
injured man, and he consented.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.980
Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.670
I attacked you for foolishly leaving
an injured man on his own.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.170
That's all.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.670
Now I need you to answer my question.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.480
Who are you?

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.690
Wait!

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.590
For a kid, you're pretty quick.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.090
Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.390
You're about to discover

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.880
the high price that accomplishment came with!

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.740
Who are you?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.240
You aren't the one I hit.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.750
Are you his friend?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.250
How can you tell that I'm not the same one?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.400
Huh?

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.510
Your face is completely different.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.690
And your voice is a little higher and thinner.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.840
What?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.620
Did I say something funny?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.610
Hey, sweetheart!

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.640
Come out here!

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.740
You're gonna love this!

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.530
Hmm...

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.380
How many years has it been since someone
was able to tell us apart?

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.780
I'm ecstatic!

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.830
Can you tell their faces and
voices are different?

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.290
No, not at all...

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.800
You see, the one Kurapika and I
beat up is the husband.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.290
Which one are you talking about?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.800
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.190
We are the Navigators.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.980
Our family provides support
for the Hunter Exam.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.260
I'm their daughter!

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.300
I'm their son!

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.330
Man, you had us fooled.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.480
The Hunter Exam changes site every year.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.380
It's quite difficult to locate it.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.600
So we Navigators help by guiding
the applicants to the site.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.570
Oh, that's how it works.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.330
But we don't help every candidate.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.300
We test applicants to see if they're qualified

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.080
to take the exam.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.590
Kurapika-dono.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.840
Yes.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.990
You successfully used the most vague of hints

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.860
to determine that we weren't spouses.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.010
The hint was these tattoos
which, in this region,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.600
mark a woman as single for life.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.580
Kurapika-dono demonstrated that
he is very knowledgeable.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.260
Therefore, he passes.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.130
Way to go, Kurapika.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.940
Thanks.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.380
Leorio-dono.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.320
Yeah...

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.580
You never realized my true identity.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.630
However, you dressed my injuries

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.020
faster and more thoroughly than any doctor.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.250
Most importantly, you continued
to reassure me

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.010
that my wife was safe.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.690
S-Stop it...

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.830
It's embarrassing...

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.850
Your kindness makes you worthy
to take the Hunter Exam.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.350
Thus, you pass.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.970
R-Really?

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.560
Thank goodness...

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.780
You did it!

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.370
And finally, Gon-dono.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.240
Yes!

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.740
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.500
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.750
You pass.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.800
We will now take you to the exam site.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.020
Isn't it great that we all passed?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.880
It's too early to celebrate.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.380
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.950
What's wrong with celebrating a little?

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.330
We're making progress.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.170
Honestly, you people really should think.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.780
Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.670
Stop moving around!

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.780
If you fall, blame yourself!

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.270
Gon and his friends enjoy a brief
journey through the sky.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:55.990
However, they still haven't reached
the starting line.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.620
Next time: Rivals x For x Survival.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.100
I'm going to do my best!
