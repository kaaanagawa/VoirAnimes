WEBVTT

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.050
Gon-kun!

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.300
Where is everyone?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.010
You need more rest, Gon-kun...

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.650
Some x Brother x Trouble

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.650
After Gon learned why Killua
had been disqualified,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.660
he was furious with Gittarackur...

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.510
Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.810
Apologize to Killua!

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.550
Apologize? For what?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.310
You don't know what you did wrong?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.450
Nope.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.370
You don't have the right to be his brother.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.700
Must I earn the right to be his brother?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.710
He doesn't need to earn the
right to be my friend!

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.350
This boy is...

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.370
Don't bother apologizing.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.860
Just take me to see Killua.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.810
What will you do then?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.460
That should be obvious...

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.060
I'm gonna rescue Killua!

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.990
You make it sound as
though I kidnapped him...

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.200
He walked away on his own.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.270
But it wasn't by choice.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.010
He was being manipulated by you people.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.990
It's the same thing as kidnapping him!

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.520
We happened to be discussing
this very subject, Gon.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.030
Kurapika and Leorio have both
lodged complaints.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.090
The committee has been discussing

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.870
the fairness of Killua's disqualification.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.290
Killua had been behaving

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.420
in a strange manner during and
since his battle with the man

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.040
who called himself Gittarackur!

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.040
I believe that he was hypnotized
into committing murder.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.880
Under normal circumstances,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.800
it would be impossible to use
hypnosis to induce a person to kill.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.240
However, as Killua was raised
in a family of assassins,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.170
murder was a part of his daily life,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.310
so it's natural that he would lack
the ethical restraint of most!

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.790
I want to mention

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.060
that the attack happened during the
match between Bodoro and me.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.180
It's possible that he was trying to help me.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.530
Given that, the one who should be disqualified

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.780
is me.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.850
In any case,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.790
Killua was not in control of his own actions.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.040
Thus, he should not have been disqualified!

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.930
That is mere speculation.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.800
There is no proof.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.280
There were no clear signs of manipulation.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.310
In fact, I would question

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.060
the claim that he was hypnotized.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.400
I agree that the incident occurred after

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.190
the battle between Leorio
and Bodoro had begun.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.980
At that point, both fighters
were evenly matched.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.280
Bodoro had more experience.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.960
But in terms of raw combat ability,
Leorio was the stronger.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.890
There was no need for Killua to interfere.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.560
There was some other funny
business happening.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.840
Like when you fought Hisoka.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.470
Back then,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.470
what did he say to you?

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.480
Neither of you seemed particularly tired.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.930
But Hisoka whispered something in your ear,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.230
right before conceding.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.230
That's pretty strange.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.930
I'd understand surrendering after your
opponent whispers something to you,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.700
as happened with Hanzo and me,
or Bodoro and Hisoka.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.740
Because we were under
considerable pressure.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.560
But in your case, the exact opposite happened.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.520
I have to wonder if you struck
some sort of bargain.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.210
If you're going to question
anything that seems odd,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.010
your own victory was quite odd, indeed.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.010
If you have nothing to hide,
you should tell us what he said.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.270
Right now.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.660
I have no obligation to tell you.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.610
Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.220
Not really.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.400
If you consider my victory to be odd,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.960
a victory by default would be equally odd.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.410
What?!

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.580
None of that matters...

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.790
Come on...

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.790
I want to get this lecture
over with so I can leave.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.920
Hey, now...

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.680
None of that matters!

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.560
It's pointless to argue over whether
someone should have passed.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.100
If you aren't happy about passing,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.810
keep working until you're satisfied.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.320
If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam,
he'll definitely pass!

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.660
It's unfortunate that he failed this time,
but it is what it is.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.330
What does matter...

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.580
If you've been forcing Killua to kill,
against his will, all this time,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.040
I'll make you pay!

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.490
Make me pay?

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.150
What, exactly, will you do?

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.030
I won't do anything.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.510
Only, once I rescue Killua,
I'll never let you see him again!

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.110
Ahem.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.620
Is everyone finished?

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.950
Gon is absolutely correct.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.120
You must decide for yourselves
if you were worthy of passing.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.370
You may complain about
the results all you like,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.880
but we will not be changing our minds.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.130
Killua has been disqualified.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.140
And the rest of you have passed the exam.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.150
Okay, then I shall continue the orientation.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.650
The cards I've passed out
are your Hunter Licenses.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.480
This card allows you

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.530
to enter 90% of the countries
that limit immigration,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.670
as well as 75% of the restricted
areas in the world.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.420
Crazy...

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.130
This card also provides free access
to 95% of public facilities,

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.530
and a line of credit that rivals
large corporations.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.930
If you sell the card, you'll have enough
money to last seven lifetimes.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.230
And if you keep it, you'll still
be living in comfort.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.440
So take extra care that your
license isn't lost or stolen.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.610
You won't receive a replacement.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.470
According to our estimates,
one in five Hunters

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.060
lose their card within a year of receiving it.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.090
As a Hunter, your first challenge
is to protect your card.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.090
The rest is up to you.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.090
Rise above challenges,
believe in your own strength,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.360
and fulfill your dreams.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.600
Then,

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.600
we now declare the seven members
here to be new Hunters!

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:39.200
Hunter Vocabulary

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.200
License

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.970
Gittarackur...

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.470
Tell me where Killua is.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.990
Are you really going to take him away?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.480
I think that's a bad idea.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.230
I don't care what you think!

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.090
Killua is my friend.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.730
I'm taking him with me.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.840
Do they feel the same way?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.500
You bet.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.240
Fine.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.540
I doubt you'll be able to
make it there anyway.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.500
Killua went home.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.500
Home?

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.640
Kukuroo Mountain.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.510
Our family lives at the very top.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.670
Kukuroo Mountain?

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.500
Got it. Thanks.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.750
Is it really okay

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.770
for an assassin to give away
his base of operations?

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.330
Sure, it isn't a secret or anything.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.270
The locals all know where we live.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.750
Well, I'm sure they'll see the
light once they arrive.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.010
We live in completely different worlds...

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.280
Oh, this?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.040
Yep, it's broken.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.970
He has incredible potential.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.550
I can understand why you want
to see him grow up.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.300
Didn't I tell you?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.240
<i>But that makes him all the more dangerous.</i>

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.750
<i>This would be the best chance to...</i>

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.640
Gon is my prey.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.860
Touch him, and you'll suffer
the consequences.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.240
I know.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.490
I've only known you for a short while,
but I know your tastes.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.300
So, Hisoka.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.250
What are you going to do now?

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.490
Wait patiently.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.820
For the fruit to ripen...

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.400
Kukuroo Mountain?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.770
Never heard of it before.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.340
Kurapika, do you know where it is?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.360
Hey, Kurapika!

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.270
Huh?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.040
Oh, what is it?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.390
The mountain!

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.920
He said something about Kukuroo Mountain.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.780
Do you know where it might be?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.270
No, I don't...

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.310
We can look it up online.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.530
Yo!

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.540
Oh, Hanzo-san!

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.220
I'm going back to my country.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.430
It was a short, yet seemingly long
acquaintance, but I had fun.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.800
So did I.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.290
If you ever visit my country, let me know.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.320
I can show you the best tourist spots!

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:49.980
See ya!

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.950
Bye!

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.810
Cloud-Hidden Ninja
Hanzo

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.500
A shinobi who tries to leave an impression...

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.170
Hey.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.700
Sorry about getting so excited back there.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.520
No, I also lost control.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.810
Forgive me.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.580
No, I only got mad because you were right.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.590
I was using you to take out my
frustration for winning by default.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.730
But I'm over that now.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.340
Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.570
The question is what to do next.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.350
Yes, you're right.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.580
I'm going to travel the world,
gathering information

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.860
and discovering new species,
as an Exotic Game Hunter.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.960
An Exotic Game Hunter...

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.980
Hey, what's that?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.080
Oh, this?

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.120
You can use this to obtain
all kinds of information.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.400
Is there anything you'd like to know?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.040
I can look it up on the spot.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.120
Oh...

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.780
Can you look up a Hunter named Ging?

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.630
Ging Freecss.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.630
Sure, hold on...

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.370
Satotz?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.420
Hey, who is this Ging guy?

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.140
Huh?

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.550
All information related to him is behind

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.400
a tight security system that

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.900
requires a bunch of different accesses.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.550
He has some serious influence,
even at the national level.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.400
Huh? Really?

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.910
Forget it, then...

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.820
Looks like your dad is someone really special.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.060
Okay, let me know if anything comes up.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.660
This is my e-mail address.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.360
Bye.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.450
Bye!

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.090
We should have asked him to
look up Kukuroo Mountain.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.310
That's right.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.540
It's okay.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.620
As Chairman Netero was saying,
we are all Hunters now.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.730
It's a bad idea to let other Hunters
know what you're doing.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.670
We can look it up ourselves.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.820
Gon-kun.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.130
Satotz-san!

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.230
Gon-kun, you forgot this.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.070
Oh, right...

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.130
Thanks!

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.960
And do you have a moment?

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.060
We'll be waiting in the lobby.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.820
Okay!

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.140
Forgive me, but I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.460
I happen to specialize in the
discovery, restoration,

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.470
and preservation of ancient ruins.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.790
When I first began,

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.480
I was only focused on the glory
derived from new discoveries.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.660
But after watching a certain Hunter at work,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.030
I came to feel ashamed.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.980
That Hunter would discover ruins,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.120
spend his own money to
completely restore them,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.020
and take steps to preserve the
ruins for future generations,

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.860
thus ensuring that ordinary people
would have a chance to see them.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.630
I was more impressed by
his dedication to his job

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.540
than by the beauty of the ruins.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.840
The work he did to preserve those ruins

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.150
has been documented in manuals
used around the world.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.660
And this Hunter, Gon-kun,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.820
was Ging Freecss, the man
you were asking about.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.320
I wished to meet him,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.920
so I did some investigating.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.700
However, quite frankly, he is an enigma.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.930
I wasn't able to learn anything about him...

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.280
Really? Figures.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.940
My goal is to become a Hunter like him.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.410
My dream is to thank him in person one day.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.770
Uh-huh.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.790
That's all I had to say.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.030
Sorry for interrupting you.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.420
It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.160
Bye!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:21.700
Oh...

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.110
Gon-kun.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.710
Hmm?

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.890
Oh, never mind...

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.210
Take care of yourself.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.350
Yeah. You, too.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:35.720
Bye!

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.310
First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.020
Yeah.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.280
Kukuroo Mountain...

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.990
There it is.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.530
"Kukuroo Mountain.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.370
A 3,722 meter-high mountain,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.990
in the Dentora region of
the Republic of Padokea."

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.330
The Republic of Padokea?

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.740
Never heard of it.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.020
Where is it?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.250
Hold on.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.760
I'll bring up a map.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.010
This is the Republic of Padokea.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.440
It should be fine.
It appears to be a stable country.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.010
It allows ordinary tourists.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.330
That's where we'll find Killua?

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.230
By airship, it will take three days to reach...

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.690
When do we leave?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.980
Today! Right now!

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.980
Yeah, no objection from me!

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.970
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.950
What's going on?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.760
We've been stuck in one place forever.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.100
This won't do.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.620
We'll be late for our flight.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.020
Pops! Do something!

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.100
I'm afraid I can't help this traffic.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.800
And this is the only road.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.720
In that case...

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.580
Yahoo!

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.110
Hey, Gon!

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.610
Do you realize how far away the airport is?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.700
I want to rescue Killua as soon
as humanly possible!

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.920
Fine, you win.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.130
This reminds me of the Hunter Exam.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:35.880
That's right.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.800
This is nothing compared
to the Hunter Exam.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.390
Yeah...

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.980
You got that right.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.790
Okay...

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.570
Race you to the airport!

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.150
Ready...

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.880
Go!

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.460
Gon and his friends set off for
the Republic of Padokea.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.890
Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua's home is located.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.140
Satotz.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.490
Menchi. Buhara.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.360
Hey, Satotz...

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.160
That was a close call.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.070
You were watching?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.500
That boy is a mystery...

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.440
I find myself wanting to help him.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.660
I almost let the cat out of the bag.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.440
About how the real Hunter Exam

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.500
hasn't ended yet.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.680
Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.150
Fetch, doggie!

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.810
That's it...

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.170
Roll over, doggie!

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.600
Oh, yeah!
