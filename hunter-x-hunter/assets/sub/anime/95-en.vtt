00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.980
Looks like you guys have been
waiting here to kill me.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.990
Sorry, but the prey is about
to become the predator.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.450
You'll die before you can even strike back.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.970
Really?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.800
I barely felt a thing.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.500
You could punch us like that a few
thousand times without killing us.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.910
I get it.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.900
You're trying to act tough.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.350
You're swinging long after the ball's
already in the catcher's mitt.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.350
Just as a warning, I'm not
using my full strength.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.970
I can run faster and throw harder punches.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.740
This is a surprise.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.280
He's actually aiming for my face.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.550
I was certain his eyes couldn't
even follow my motion earlier...

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.080
Just a lucky guess?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.040
Him, too...

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
He's clearly ascertaining where
I'm going to be before he attacks.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.550
It's only been a minute since I encountered them.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.550
They've adapted to my speed that quickly?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.310
They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.500
How amusing...

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.560
It makes this more of a challenge!

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.030
Grudge x And x Dread

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.220
Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.510
You obviously can't compete physically.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.320
How are you gonna compensate?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.040
With guns? Numbers?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.170
We'll use wit and experience.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.130
Where did this stuff come from?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.410
Smoke? Gas?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.680
Poison gas?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.180
Or sleeping gas?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.070
No, they're standing within it.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.190
This must be some kind of special power.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.090
Are you scared?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.570
You can retreat if you want.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.430
Does that mean you aren't running away?

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.080
Then this is a smokescreen.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.110
They'll use it as cover for their attack.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.520
Well, let's see what they can do...

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.130
Here it comes!

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.300
What?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.680
When you use <i>Gyo</i>, your body freezes briefly.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.560
This trick won't work on the same
opponent too many times.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.560
But it only needs to once.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.490
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.240
That didn't hurt at all.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.790
I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.750
but you didn't do any damage.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.330
What's this?

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.230
Gee, I wonder...

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.390
It's time.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.580
Adding interest.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.090
Answer me.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.550
Answer me!

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.930
Your anger is blinding you
to your surroundings...

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.560
It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.640
Hey! Damn it!

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.510
They're gone?

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.240
Where are you?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.820
It's time.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.270
Adding interest.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.720
It doesn't matter what your power does.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.750
I just have to rip you apart!

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.500
Looks like he's powerless against <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.020
Well, we're dealing with
a level-one soldier ant.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.520
With APR on him, we can easily track him.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.940
We just need to chase him down,
box him in, and that'll be the end.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.030
But doesn't your ability lose its effect
if the target moves too far away?

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.970
It'll stop adding interest,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.540
but the effect will remain.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.310
Once I'm back in range,
the counter will start up again.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.830
But even if IRS doesn't kick in,
he'll be easy to finish off.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.110
We've already learned his attacks.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.350
You fool!

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.880
We may know what pitch he'll use,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.930
but we still can't put the bat on the ball.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.880
Let's leave him for a <i>Nen</i> user who's
better equipped to handle him.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.930
You're right.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.020
I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.930
Damn...

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.430
I can't shake this thing.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.450
I can't outrun it...

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.450
<i>So this is </i>Nen<i>.</i>

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.450
I need more than just speed here.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.320
Kite's in here.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.730
He is no longer the person you once knew.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.020
It's okay.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.740
We'll find a way to cure him!

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.650
Hotel Rafflesia...

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.250
Hotel Rafflesia:
Dark Inn

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.630
Once I've dealt an enemy a
certain amount of damage,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.250
I'm able to trap

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.450
an entire body or merely a single part inside.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.510
This must be how he took my eye.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.710
If I release him from the cage,
he'll return to his original size.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.030
Be careful.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.790
He cannot use <i>Nen</i>, but he is still strong.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.540
Kite...

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.050
Most likely, they used him to train soldiers.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.860
He automatically attacks
anyone who approaches.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.160
Kite...

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.400
It's okay now.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.390
It's okay.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.930
It's been a while...

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.900
since you punched me.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.540
That hurt a lot...

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.970
You're going to let this beating continue?

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.390
Gon can't use <i>Nen</i> to defend himself either, right?

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.720
It's okay, Gon will notice.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.420
Maybe he already has,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.030
and is still...

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.030
Perhaps.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.910
He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.570
allowing himself to be hit.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.160
For real?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.170
Kite's attacks may be robotic
and easy to anticipate.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.980
But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt
so quickly in his current state!

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.890
I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.020
This is the reality we've created
that we must now face.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.850
He'll go right next.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.360
Right again.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.080
And then left.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.030
Then a feint...

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.540
He really does fight like a robot.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.080
Kite isn't this weak...

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.360
Kite's punches

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.550
hurt much more!

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.510
I'm sorry, Kite.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.590
It's our fault you're like this...

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.890
Get some rest.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.330
We'll take it from here.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.510
Level two...

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.250
Gon can't see that thing,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.850
but it activates when anyone touches Kite.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.320
You must be highly skilled at
combat to clear this test.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.860
I've already blocked Kite's <i>Nen</i>,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.860
so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.710
Be careful.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.140
If you touch him again, he'll attack.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.130
What do I do?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.870
How did you stop him?

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.880
We injured him badly.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.160
We had no choice, but I'm still sorry.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.880
If you stay away, he won't attack.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.110
Kite...

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.940
Just wait a little longer.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.360
I'll get you back to normal soon.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.080
Killua...

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.380
I want that one myself!

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.140
Killua...

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.760
I knew something was different when I saw you.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.690
What did you guys do in the
short time since I saw you last?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.200
We didn't do anything.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.460
Our enemies did.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.710
A Few Weeks Later

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:22.180
Twenty-nine days have passed
since Gon lost his <i>Nen</i>.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.770
Are you sure we should let them come along?

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.390
We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.180
I see no problem with that.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.470
The test was to determine
who would enter NGL...

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.430
And we are headed to the
Republic of East Gorteau.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.990
Sounds like a technicality to me.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.410
Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.740
No, they're grown tigers now.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.540
They can take care of themselves.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.620
I would agree that Killua is capable,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.380
but what about Gon?

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.510
At the very end, I was impressed
by the way he moved.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.150
But he hasn't shown any fire since.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.800
And he clearly isn't focused during training.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.240
I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.990
But he's consistently inconsistent.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.310
He only gets serious when he absolutely must.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:34.000
I think his lack of drive these past few
weeks will actually give him a boost.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.450
A boost?

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.750
He's been saving up all that energy...

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.760
To unleash when he finds his hated foe.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.730
Well, we'll see soon enough.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.510
Tomorrow, Gon's <i>Nen</i> will return...

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.280
And the enemy is before us!

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.270
Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.290
What is the agenda behind
the sudden flurry of activity

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.820
recently observed in East Gorteau?

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.030
Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.790
all citizens to gather in the capital city,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.420
Peijing, to celebrate the
nation's birth in ten days.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.580
Yes, there have been occasions
in the past during which

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.300
all citizens were invited to participate.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.090
However, we've never seen
anything on this scale,

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.050
where practically every citizen,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.340
from babies to the ill, has been summoned
for a celebration spanning three days.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.310
The logical conclusion would be that
the goal this time is different.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.570
What do you believe the goal to be?

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.960
Well, it would send a powerful message

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.080
if he were to announce his successor
and abdication simultaneously.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.580
But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme
Leader relinquishing his power.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.840
It may also be meant to distract
from some other matter.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.530
In any event, the whole world will be
watching East Gorteau in ten days.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.270
Next...

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:19.350
Colt believes the celebration
will be used as a screening.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.300
We don't know what they'll do
with those found to have <i>Nen</i>,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.490
but ninety-nine percent of
the humans there will die.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.740
We must stop it before that happens!

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.160
Our time limit is ten days.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.740
What's the old man up to?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.740
He sent an e-mail saying that he's
already inside East Gorteau,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.290
but I haven't heard from him since.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.500
Do you think he's been taken out?

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.590
If he fails to contact us today,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.510
we've been told to assume as much.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.770
Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.290
That old man's got some sharp ears...

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.040
He already knows everything.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.780
Including the fact that you boys are here.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.850
And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.340
Divide into three pairs and draw the
Royal Guard away from the King.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.390
The night before the celebration,
the operation will begin at midnight.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.770
From the sharp-eared old man.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.100
That guy really scares me...

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:45.300
I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.070
So I'll make myself scarce!

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.430
See you around...

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.190
Bye!

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.540
Okay, now you can use <i>Nen</i> again.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.580
Give it a try.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.090
Gon...

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.890
Sorry, but I'm still not convinced
we should keep you around.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.590
Show me your resolve.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.400
Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:24.580
If your attack is too weak, we'll replace
you with another Hunter.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.470
Seriously, the master can be so difficult.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.730
He already agreed to bring Gon along...

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.280
Gon, show him your Jajanken.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.740
You want me to attack you for real?

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.570
Don't insult me!

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.190
If you hold back in the slightest,
you're off the team!

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.850
Got it.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.360
First comes rock...

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.790
Gon,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.400
that's enough...

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.670
Right, big guy?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.400
Y-Yeah...

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.410
Oh.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.620
K-Killua, thank you.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.660
Sorry about that, Morel-san!

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.790
I was really about to kill you!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.380
You got me... You got me good.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.750
You go crazy with the best of them.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.240
We'll split up now.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.290
Use whatever means you deem
best to fulfill your mission.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.310
Gon and Killua, as you requested,
you're assigned to Neferpitou.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.320
Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the
one called Menthuthuyoupi.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.550
Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.570
Best of luck to you.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.040
The preparations for the final
battles are complete.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.780
Ten days remain until that moment.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.240
Next time: A x Lawless x Home.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.610
Wanna see what being controlled is like?

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.540
Huh?

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.280
Stick this antenna here...

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.180
Huh?

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.270
It has to be Killua.
