WEBVTT

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.740
The Hunters have entered the palace in
order to defeat the Chimera Ant King.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.290
My attacks don't work?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.330
What is this thing?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.020
Don't you run!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.090
Answer me!

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.200
What is this thing?!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.480
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.600
If you wanna know, catch me first!

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.150
To save the injured Shoot,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.610
Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.910
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.640
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.360
In that case...

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.140
I must not lose consciousness...

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.000
If I pass out,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.760
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.090
Every little bit of damage counts...

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.000
I can still fight...

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.530
I can still...

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.440
Right now, my job...

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.400
isn't to help Shoot!

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.010
It's to use my power to help the others,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.500
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.690
Though it broke his heart,
Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.500
and follow Gon and Killua instead,
in order to fulfill his mission.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.620
Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into
the depths of the palace to rescue Palm.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.830
Satellite Dragonflies!

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.360
I'm gonna rescue her.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.860
Palm is a friend of a friend.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.240
That makes her a friend...

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.810
My friend!

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.290
As Morel, the first Hunter
to reach the throne room,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.790
waited to continue his battle with Pouf,
who remained in his cocoon,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.250
Netero and the King were leaving the palace,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.370
and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.020
their target for avenging Kite.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.010
Revenge x And x Recovery

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.170
Do you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.280
remember me?

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.770
I'm Gon Freecss!

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.600
I came here

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.350
to get Kite back from you!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.360
Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.120
The only thing on Pitou's mind was
surviving the current threat

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.760
while carrying out the King's order.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.180
Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.630
I must protect Komugi...

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.940
At any cost!

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.630
Something's not right.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.890
Watching from a short distance, Killua
noticed that something was strange.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.080
Why isn't the enemy preparing for
battle when we're right here?

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.650
I can't sense any aura at all...

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.650
Pitou might as well be completely
naked... Utterly defenseless.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.650
Does Pitou think it can win without aura?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.160
No, that isn't possible.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.760
The aura coming from Gon now
doesn't even compare to his usual.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.400
Even Pitou can't fight that without using</i> Nen.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.270
Is it because of where we are?

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.700
Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.480
there'll be time to activate </i>Nen<i> if we do attack?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.660
That's possible.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.480
However, for some reason...

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.290
That doesn't seem to be it.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.510
It almost looks like...

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.970
That's it.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.000
It looks like...

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.300
a mother

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.600
using its own body to guard something weaker.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.470
That's ridiculous.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.380
Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.250
But then, why did Grandpa...

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.080
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.890
...say something that cryptic?

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.000
While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.190
the girl lying before them brought back

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.860
images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.380
Get away from her.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.390
I'm telling you to take that
monster and get away from her.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.270
And then, fight me!

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.170
Fight me, so I can get Kite back!

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.670
The act of placing both palms face-up
to display one's lack of malice

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.170
was a gesture Killua recognized...

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.080
Please

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.330
wait.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.910
What the hell?!

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.860
What am I supposed to wait for?

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.600
Get up! We're going outside!

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.610
Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.910
left Gon without a target for his rage.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.110
Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully
understanding the current situation.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.870
It was...

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.660
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.200
He was saying something
unexpected happened!

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.260
Grandpa knew nothing when
he brought the dragon down.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.100
Grandpa's mission was probably

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.460
to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to
separate the King and Royal Guard.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.290
But he didn't know that she was here, too.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.110
Wait, this woman must be

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.320
the third party that none of us knew about!

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.370
And she's most likely

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.060
the reason the King hurt himself.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.320
Why would the King do something
so out of character?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.580
Because she is someone
who's special to the King.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.200
Pitou isn't taking her apart.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.750
Pitou is healing her at the King's command!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.730
Pitou isn't only prevented from using
</i> En <i>when healing someone.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.840
All aura must be focused on
healing ability when using it.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.450
However, Killua knew that this
information would only have

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.500
a negative effect on Gon.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.040
What do I do?

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.830
What do I tell him?

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.260
Go—

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.090
I'll do anything!

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.190
I'll do anything you say!

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.720
So please wait.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.100
I...

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.320
must save this person!

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.450
Save...

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.860
Save what?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.850
"Anything"?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.110
When you say "anything"...

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.870
Killua...

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.880
I'm asking the questions.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.190
What is it that you must save?

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.650
Amidst the extreme tension,
the answer Pitou chose to give was...

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.410
This person is someone...

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.790
Someone who's important
to someone important to me.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.810
...the truth.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.000
She is the reason the King is who he is.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.630
If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.340
She's that important.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.180
So...

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.820
All I care about is saving her!

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.830
Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.110
So please wait!

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.990
You want to save her?

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.970
You must save her?

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.220
Save her?

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.360
How dare you say that...

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.740
How dare you?!

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.380
Damn it!

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.580
The hell if...

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.740
The hell if I'll listen to you!

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.630
Gon, hold on!

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.140
It's likely that we were
the ones that injured her.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.090
It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.150
And?

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.240
Pitou is probably telling the
truth about healing her.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:25.900
So?

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.260
Let's wait until it's done.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.490
"Likely"?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.160
"Probably"?

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.510
You want me to wait because
of "likely" and "probably"?

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.920
And after we wait, it's likely that this thing

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.880
will do what I want?

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.740
Likely? Probably?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.930
Seriously?!

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.930
That's crap!

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.390
That's just crap!

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.690
Is something wrong with you?!

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:08.700
You want... You want me to trust this thing?!

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.950
I can't do that!

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.380
If you want, you may also have my right arm...

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.720
If that isn't enough,

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.220
you can take both legs...

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:50.420
If you're worried I'll change my mind
after the healing finishes,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.740
you can break any part of my body
that isn't required to heal her.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.370
Please let me save her!

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.770
That isn't fair...

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.540
That isn't fair, damn it!

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.540
Why are you helping her,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.300
after everything you did to Kite?!

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.270
Gon!

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.820
Why?!

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.300
Why?!

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.580
To hell with that.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.590
First comes—

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.600
Gon, if you kill Pitou,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.110
we'll never get Kite back.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.430
You have it easy, Killua.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.120
You're perfectly calm.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.370
Since it means nothing to you...

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.400
I'm only saying this because
you're out of control.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.330
Did you forget the first thing
you said when we came here?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.540
We're here to get Kite back!

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.040
Pull it together!

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.780
Yeah.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.130
I'm okay now.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.240
How long?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.330
How long do I have to wait?

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.330
To completely heal her

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.090
will take three to four hours.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.340
No, I can't wait that long.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.100
If I have an hour,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.050
I can heal her most critical injuries.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.200
Please give me that.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:04.370
In one hour, you're coming with
me to Peijing, to heal Kite.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.870
Can you promise me that?

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.870
I swear to keep that promise!

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.940
I'll wait right here for one hour.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.040
Next time: Insult x And x Payback.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.050
I can't think of anything right now...

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.620
Killua, insult me back!

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.460
I... feel better now.
