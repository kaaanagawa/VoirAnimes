00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
There are six distinct categories of <i>Nen</i> users.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.110
Enhancer.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.030
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.960
Transmuter.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.220
Conjurer.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.840
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.140
Emitter.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.460
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.860
Manipulator.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.440
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750
Specialist.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.690
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.720
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.030
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled <i>Nen</i> user.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.830
There's one month before the auction begins.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.600
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.040
and bring it here.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.560
If you are successful, you will be hired,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.020
and begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.270
The man talking was, most likely,
not the actual employer.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.990
That only illustrates the distance
between the boss and me...

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.290
I shall reduce that distance to zero,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.590
until the employer feels that he
can trust me with his secrets...

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.860
I will pass this test.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.070
First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.080
Nen x Users x Unite?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.410
Hmm? The door won't open.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.840
I forgot to mention one thing.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.430
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.990
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.070
Dowsing Chain
The Guiding Ring Finger Chain

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.020
That's impressive.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.940
He used a chain to catch the bullets?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.540
Three with guns.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.480
Six with swords.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.300
Two more with swords above.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.030
You guys did a good job
of concealing your presences,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.350
but you're too weak.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.930
I don't even need to use my <i>Nen</i>...

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.360
Now I understand.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.650
So that's what's going on.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.670
He's the one.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.200
Stop them.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.530
I'll give you three seconds.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.040
One...

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.680
Two...

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.290
Okay.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.310
I get it.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.080
Wh-What's going on?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.440
They really were made from <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.150
I could tell when I landed a punch,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.440
that I was hitting aura shaped like a human...

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.530
However,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.170
I didn't realize it was his <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.310
How did you know?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.580
You were always careful to stand
next to others for camouflage.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.290
But when I observed from above,
everything was clear.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.420
You were the only person not under attack.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.960
I realized something was wrong

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.430
when assailants appeared on the second floor.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.100
After I jumped on the chandelier,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.590
they just stood there, swords swinging

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.730
in a futile attempt to reach me.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.280
I assume they received the following order:

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.480
Attack the nearest enemy.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.870
The assailants were given
simple instructions,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.740
so their attacks were also simple.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.120
However, it would take a skilled <i>Nen</i> user

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.420
to control eleven human-sized
auras simultaneously.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.210
A <i>Nen</i> user who would most
likely be a Manipulator.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.900
Given the size of auras involved,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.720
the Manipulator had to be
within a few meters.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.430
Which meant that the <i>Nen</i> user

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.930
was inside this room.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.440
You nailed it.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.840
My name is Shachmono Tocino.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.620
I'm actually a Hunter.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.890
I work for the boss here,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.740
so I will have seniority over you.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.610
Now that everything's clear,
could you drop the knife?

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.840
Judging by those chains,
you must be a Manipulator...

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.120
Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.940
I was just following orders from the boss.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.710
"Test them by trying to kill them."

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.480
But I never expected you to
pick up on me so fast.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.500
Well, the four of you together

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.680
should be able to escape this mansion.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.860
Good luck.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.360
Four?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.300
Is there another plant in the room?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.620
I'll assume that was meant as a diversion.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.500
But either way, it was a mistake.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.170
I shall determine if there
are any other plants,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.180
before we all start becoming paranoid.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.430
There.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.460
You are a plant.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.420
Th-That's ridiculous!

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.150
What makes you say that?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.910
Your chain just started swinging.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.030
That is dowsing.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.410
Huh? What's that?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.040
Dowsing was originally

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.000
a technique for locating water
or metals underground.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.380
But it was also used in divination.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.180
I've heard of the technique being
employed as a lie detector.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.020
That still doesn't

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.180
provide concrete proof that I'm a plant.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.770
He's probably right.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.440
Your heart began to pound as
soon as he pointed at you.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.620
If you were innocent,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.660
your heart rate would have slowly increased,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.800
due to the stress of being wrongly accused.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.330
But your heartbeat immediately sped up,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.570
before gradually slowing down.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.420
The typical melody of a liar...

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.010
Coming from both of you.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.790
I'm convinced.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.180
Both of them accuse you.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.110
That's two of the remaining five.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.300
Wait! Hold on!

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.150
That doesn't make it true.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.530
It's possible

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.080
that three out of five are
applicants and two are fakes.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.070
I can confirm

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.580
that he is not a plant.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.960
Excuse me?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.790
I think you meant "she," not "he."

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.710
And it appears that you
are not a plant, either.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.770
My point is that we can't trust you!

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.010
You two could be working together.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.400
A-Anyway, this is a waste of time.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.970
We won't get anywhere by standing around.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.730
No other choice, then.
I will have to settle this
matter on my own.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.000
"Everything that comes
into contact with my fist
will completely burn."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.120
Huh?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.210
This is my special power...

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.750
Great Haikuist!

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.010
Great Haikuist
Wandering Haiku Poet

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.060
Damn it all to hell.
It didn't burn very well.
That was a failure.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.240
That was a haiku,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.510
the prized literary art of my homeland.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.240
When I read a haiku, it happens.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.720
There's your explanation.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.610
Back to the subject at hand.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.940
"Any person who
responds untruthfully to
my question will burn."

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.850
In other words, liars will burn in hell.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.980
Here is my question.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.100
Are you a plant?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.980
No.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.560
What about you?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.730
I am not.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.740
And you?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.490
No.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.020
Are you a plant?

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.250
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.750
Think carefully before you answer.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.700
Are you a plant?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.610
Give me your answer!

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.020
My answer is yes.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.850
Impressive.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.810
I'll reward you with some information.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.920
My name is Squala.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.290
I don't have an official license,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.310
but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.740
I've used my Manipulator abilities

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.290
to instruct something to
follow a certain order.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.720
You managed to unmask me,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.180
but that doesn't mean you'll
be able to escape alive...

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.290
What was the something,
and what was the order?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.460
This wouldn't be much of
a test if I just told you.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.540
Fool.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.690
Even if you torture me, I won't talk.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.280
Huh?

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.830
This is my power, Instant Lover.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.220
I am also a Manipulator.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.880
Anyone I kiss becomes my slave.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.640
M-M-Mistress...

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.580
Take that, and that, and that.
And that... And that!

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:42.990
More!

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.850
Please step on me more...

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.240
Now, answer my question!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.130
What did you use your <i>Nen</i> on,
and what was your command?

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.300
Talk, quickly.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.000
If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.990
I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.670
I am just a l-lowly dog trainer...

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.100
That is...

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.640
A fearsome power.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.920
I used my <i>Nen</i> on the dogs

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.270
that run around this mansion.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.990
For example, the Maltese were told to nip

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.050
at a target's feet, to slow them.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.260
That's when the St. Bernard is to use
its large body to smother the target.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.970
At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.030
and finish off the target...

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.180
If the target still escapes,
the bulldogs will—

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.490
That's enough...

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.790
Release the <i>Nen</i> you used on them!

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.200
A-At once!

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.500
So the dog tamer has been
reduced to a pet, huh?

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.020
Don't say that...

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.060
I only did it to make him talk.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.190
If I wanted a man as a pet,
I'd be more picky.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.160
That reminds me,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.260
I never did catch your name.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.450
I'm Basho.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.760
As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.640
I am Baise.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.890
Melody.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.640
It appears you can hear heartbeats.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.210
What category do you fall into?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.960
Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.710
Playing coy, huh?

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.470
What about you?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.430
I'd like to know your name.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.780
Would you tell us?

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.360
I refuse.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.810
We do not know if we'll
be working together.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.030
Yeah, that's true.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.240
We cleared the first test,
escaping the mansion,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.010
but the real test has just begun.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.940
We must locate one of the designated items,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.370
or we can't get the job.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.030
If we're all interested in this job,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.700
we're bound to run into one other again.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.450
What is your opinion of this group?

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.370
This particular group looks promising.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.350
More promising than him, at least.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.680
I will not require him for a while.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.020
Put him away for now.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.330
I trust you can handle that, Squala.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.070
Y-Yes...

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.270
If I find one of the objects
and earn the contract,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.280
I will have passage to the
Yorknew City auction.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.800
Yes, I absolutely must attend!

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.990
The Phantom Troupe will be there...

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.010
The band of thieves

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.840
that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.660
Our eyes burn a deep scarlet.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.100
Those thieves were willing to
murder to obtain those eyes,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.790
considered one of the world's
top seven beautiful things.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.080
I will never forgive that act.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.970
I shall track them down

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.110
and utterly annihilate them!

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.370
Hmm, so this is <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:04.490
Looks like the memory card that
Kil found is the real deal.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:11.130
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.870
You bet I can.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.110
I'll strip down the code,
and clear the entire game.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.100
I'll put an end to the legend,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.140
winning fifty billion Jenny in the process.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.760
Oh, right.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.880
This was a trade...

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.900
I have to tell Kil the URL for
the Hunter-only website.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.210
If I break my end of the bargain,

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.760
he might start talking about breaking
my precious figures again.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.180
There it is, Killua.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.190
Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.860
We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.450
I can't wait!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.450
You're jumping the gun...

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.190
We still have two weeks before
we're supposed to meet.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.670
Oh, you're right.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.200
It's been six months since we
saw them, so I'm getting excited!

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.260
Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.210
that we would come to Yorknew
for a reason like this.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.990
Until we meet again.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.080
Yeah, that'll be...

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.800
September 1st, in Yorknew City.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.670
The auction begins on September 1st.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.360
We'll have to gather as much information
on <i>Greed Island</i> as possible beforehand.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.850
Yep, there might be information about Ging.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.230
He left a memory card with his message.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.850
There must be a connection.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.740
Anyway, once I get the URL

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.610
for the Hunter website from my brother,
we can check it out.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.380
This is it.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.760
My brother sent the URL.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.460
Great!

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.950
Let's get started.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:28.970
Yeah!

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.300
Driven by their various goals,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.280
Gon and Killua prepare for September 1st.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:45.080
What will they discover when the
Yorknew City auction begins?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.400
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.480
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:15.750
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.260
Today, we introduce Melody!

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.300
She's a Music Hunter!

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.030
Has acute hearing.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.330
She can read your state of mind by your heartbeat.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.830
Able to determine a state of mind
by listening to the heartbeat.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.120
She must have incredible senses.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.230
Hey, Killua. Did you eat my chocolate?

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.750
Female.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.880
Nah.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.920
Your face says you're lying.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.060
Next time: Gathering x Of x Heroes!

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.540
Killua, I can tell fortunes.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.150
Really?

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.360
Everyone who watched
<i>Hunter × Hunter</i> today is happy!
