WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Right, it's so simple.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.710
I merely need to fix him.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.040
I only need the power to do that.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.340
The question is how we will manage to win.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.740
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.610
You're simply awful.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.170
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.170
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.170
Come on, what are you doing?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.350
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.660
N-No way...

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.470
We never give up.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.260
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.600
To save Kite...

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.990
Promise x And x Reunion

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.530
As the Queen prepares for the King's birth,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.740
she requires the equivalent of two hundred
and fifty human meatballs per day

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.540
to give birth to a strong King.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030
It moved.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.520
Meanwhile, Gon and Killua

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.320
continue their training so they
can defeat Knuckle and Shoot,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.280
take their tokens, and return to NGL.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.830
Will this really be enough for
them to execute the plan

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.140
to slaughter Morel's disciples?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.840
Okay, all done!

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.100
You finally lasted for three hours.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.030
We did it...

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.640
That was hard!

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.230
I can't move an inch...

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.930
What are you talking about?

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.350
Stand up.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.740
We're going out.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.610
Huh?

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.790
Where to?

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.740
To see Knuckle.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.740
Wh-Why?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.900
See? You can move.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.810
Let's go!

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.630
Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.590
Jeez, don't ask questions
with obvious answers.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.380
To fight him!

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.630
Huh?!

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.630
Okay, let's go!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.730
What are you talking about?

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.450
We still have time.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.250
What if we lose?

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.230
You just try again.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.890
Huh?

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.940
Whether you win or lose isn't important.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.130
All that matters is who ends
up with the tokens, right?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.000
Yeah.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400
Which means you must take theirs.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.250
If it looks like you'll lose, run.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.780
Then try again the next day.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.910
From here on, you'll practice
<i>Ren</i> for three hours a day.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.040
After that, you'll challenge Knuckle.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.040
And you'll continue until you win.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.890
Still a no show, huh?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.320
Your owner's really bad...

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.450
Hey, stop it!

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.640
That tickles.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.770
Cut it out!

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.070
Hey, come on...

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.830
Is that Knuckle?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.480
Yeah.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.010
No way...

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.290
They're the other candidates?

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.160
Guess they must not respect me...

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.390
If I'm being compared to a couple of kids,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.150
they must not think I'm very strong...

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.340
Eh?!

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.430
Such an intimidating presence...

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.410
We should act first, but we can't move!

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.460
A duel is a battle to the death.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.780
Serious business!

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.930
It's best to fight five hours
after a good night's sleep.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.540
So what's with you kids?
You're completely worn out!

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.300
Were you just out swimming or something, eh?

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.550
Take this seriously!

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.810
You kids can never defeat me.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.440
Are you crying?

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.980
S-Stupid...

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.190
Wh-Why would I cry?

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.200
I'm not upset about this.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.140
Th-Th-These are just, well, uh...

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.110
Tears from laughing too much, fool.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.050
I'll kill you, get it?

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.450
So don't tell anyone!

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.960
Punch me!

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.960
Huh?

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.190
I'll show you how much stronger I really am.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.970
And you'll realize that I don't need
to bother dodging your punches.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.200
Hit me as many times as you like.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.460
But if I don't take a step from this spot,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.980
leave your tokens behind.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.430
This is the best chance you'll have!

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.490
You kids would need a hundred years
before you could try fighting me!

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.430
You're the one who challenged us to a duel.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.000
Don't look down on us!

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.500
I'd like to respond that way...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.760
But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.700
We have no right to argue that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.630
Not right now...

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.760
The fact is,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.520
we can't overcome everything with willpower.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.730
We can't argue with him...

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.160
But we don't have to accept it!

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.370
I won't stop hitting you until you move.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.890
Enough talk...

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.380
Just get to it.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.410
First comes rock!

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.890
What's with the intense aura?

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.090
That's cheating!

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.180
<i>I'll use</i> Gyo...

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.500
<i>No, I have to defend with </i>Ko.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.690
Crap...

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.880
But where do I defend?

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.650
If I guess wrong,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.240
I could die...

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.160
Come on...

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.050
I'd expect him to attack the belly.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.220
Yeah, that's the only real choice.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.920
Gotta be the belly.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.920
Rock...

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.300
Yeah, it's the belly!

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.920
Belly! Belly! Belly!

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.170
Paper...

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.390
Rock!

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.550
Knuckle-san?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.770
You okay?

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:56.850
I... trusted... you...

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.610
What's with him?

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.450
Obviously, he's a total idiot.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.710
Oh, are you awake?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.530
You're stronger than I thought.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.970
Guess I underestimated you...

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.230
Why didn't you take this?

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.480
You should've taken the
token and ditched me.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.790
We don't want your token.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.040
We want the strength to defeat
you in a straight-up fight.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.000
Could I ask you something?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.060
Sure, go ahead.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.630
Why did you become a Beast Hunter?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.680
Huh?

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.010
It's a long story...

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.260
And it brings back bad memories.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.750
Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.010
Simply put, to keep it from doing its job.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.610
I don't like the idea of cutting off
whatever doesn't fit the mold.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.030
My teacher says I'm just a softy.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.270
But you can't judge something that
you've never seen before...

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.450
First, you have to exchange blows.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.670
And you'll get yourself killed in the process!

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.160
You're a good kid.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.670
Now that we've fought, I see that.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.770
You, too.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.600
Huh?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.300
You!

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.760
He wouldn't leave your side.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.940
They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.370
S-Stupid!

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.700
I'm not crying...

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.100
Don't tell anyone!

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.210
Or I'll kill you...

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.610
Morel's student...

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.610
It's good!

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.120
Fight me any time you want.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.410
Huh?

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.500
I'll give you as many tries as you want.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.140
But it's impossible for you to beat me

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.950
in the twenty days left.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.010
Good stuff.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.620
What is this smoke?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.600
Where am I?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.960
All right...

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.620
Let's begin, then.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.890
What?

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.410
Chiona's squadron is missing?

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.330
Yes...

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.350
Is it similar to what happened
to Reikei's squadron?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.400
It appears so.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.840
The leader disappeared first,

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.240
and then the rest vanished, one by one.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.700
Are the humans fighting back?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.160
Well, that is the logical conclusion.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.360
We've been cutting down on
the number of soldiers,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.590
and our prey has begun to scatter.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.250
If humans target us during an extended hunt,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.440
it could be trouble.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.280
Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.140
No, we can't trouble the Queen right now.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.230
Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.150
That idea doesn't thrill me...

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.590
I'll let you handle things outside...

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.460
We'll protect the inside of the castle.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.350
I'll try to strengthen this.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.170
Just as I expected...

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.710
Well, at least she doesn't issue
any strange orders on a whim.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.180
We should start by determining
our current troop strength.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.090
How many Squadron Leaders remain?

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.880
Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.260
Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:54.700
And each officer commands
ten to fifteen soldiers.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.490
Some squadrons are under tight control,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.960
but many are free to wander around.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.270
The missing four squadrons fall
under the latter category...

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.610
Of the remaining squadrons,
over half lack discipline.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.970
And none will heed a warning.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.350
They've become arrogant since learning <i>Nen</i>.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.290
Then we could use them to lay a trap.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm sure that's what's currently going
through the enemy's mind...

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.610
Well, we should be able to
continue the current plan.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.370
Yes.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.560
Knov and I will be able to tell
once a trap has been laid.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.020
In fact, I believe we should
spring a few of those traps.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.630
Hmm?

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.340
If we ignore the disciplined squads,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.390
they'll band together and cause us problems.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.030
Most likely, they'll start pairing

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.030
disciplined and undisciplined squads together.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:11.780
If we launch an indiscriminate
attack, it will result in chaos.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.070
We should be able to eliminate
another three or four squads

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.530
before the enemy tries another approach.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.990
I can already see their next move.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.120
If all goes well, we'll finish up
before reinforcements arrive.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.940
I hope

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.430
things go that way.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.150
Okay, three hours! All done!

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.810
Well, then... Get going.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.450
Here.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.670
What, there are more of you?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.200
Don't hold back...

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.830
Help yourselves.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.210
They're here.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.910
It's on, Knuckle!

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.490
Yeah, let's go!

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.290
I'll take you both on at once!

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.920
I won't say a word about

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.790
how you're condescending to us...

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.290
We're more than happy to accept!

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.850
Let's go, Killua!

00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.470
Yeah!

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.380
Come on...

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.750
I have no time to waste playing
around with you kids.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.500
You have nothing but time.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.760
Get serious!

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.010
That's more like it!

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.770
Their bodies are completely fatigued.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.770
All that's moving them is sheer willpower.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.280
Once they've accomplished
the tough task before them,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.770
they'll gain a confidence boost
that will spur their growth.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.990
However, to complete that task,
they must defeat me!

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.580
And that ain't gonna happen

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.590
on my watch!

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.520
Come on!

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.240
That all you've got?

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.830
Given his personality,

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.230
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.360
I doubt he'd sell me out,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.900
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.080
My chance will come after they leave.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.250
I will defeat them...

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.460
Next time:

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.270
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.800
Hey, Killua.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.740
Stop it, my turn...

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.790
That's our weakness!
