00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.880
The King transformed his <i>En</i>
into countless particles,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.680
and scattered them everywhere.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.010
If there are conditions I must meet
for you to turn over Komugi,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.940
speak.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.980
This Person x And x This Moment

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.490
It appears that only one of you is here,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.010
but I shall address this
message to both of you.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.190
He knows exactly what we're doing.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.750
We won't be able to trick him.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.770
What I felt after coming into
contact with your <i>Nen</i>

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.180
was not anger, fear, or hatred.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.010
Only senses of duty and resolve.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.770
If you are fighting for the survival
of humanity, your battle is over.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.410
You need further explanation?

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.030
It seems you doubt what you've just heard.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.280
Then I shall repeat myself.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.280
You have won... The battle is over.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.540
The rest of what I have to
say is for your ears only.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.770
The reason I am here is quite simple.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.540
I have one motive...

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.590
I wish to see the human named Komugi.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.050
That is all I want.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.220
That is really all I want.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.370
I desire nothing else.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.470
After coming into contact with your <i>Nen</i>,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.090
I learned my current state and fate.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.570
And having learned my fate, I simply wish

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.770
to spend my remaining time with Komugi.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.130
That is all I want.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.590
Was this...

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.280
Was this a plan you devised after
discovering my personality?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.410
No, I already know the answer...

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.350
It's impossible.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.870
You expect me to believe you?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.730
You think I'll just accept that explanation?!

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.820
An omnipotent King would
never lie to himself in order

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.870
to fool a lower being like me!

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.210
After all the killing you have done,
and soon will do...

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.870
A creature like you...

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.380
The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.380
Impossible! That's impossible!

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.010
He's doing this because it is the truth!

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.790
I believe it was only a slight change...

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.960
Huh?

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.020
Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.620
In my current state, I am not a god,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.530
but I...

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.530
No...

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.900
Perhaps, I only feel this way
because everything has fallen into place.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.800
You should know I have very little time.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.110
I want you to tell me her location,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.920
so I do not have to search for her.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.880
What are you saying?!

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.920
Stop this...

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.900
Yes, I know where she is!

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.450
Why don't you just torture it out of me?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.930
I know the answer.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.940
We both know that isn't an option.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.940
Your aura is as strong and beautiful
as any I have ever beheld.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.810
Stop this!

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.200
All I can do is to ask you to help me.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.280
Don't!

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.920
I am part Ant now...

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.700
I know very well how important
you are to the race...

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.800
Not that...

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.300
Don't go to such lengths...

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.880
You mustn't do that...

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.380
I'll tell you.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.020
But on one condition.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.760
May I use my power

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.260
to watch your final moments with her?

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.770
If that is what it takes to be with Komugi,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.550
you certainly may.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.400
Sorry, Killua...

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.360
I couldn't

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.760
keep our promise...

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.760
4-7-1, marshal...

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.770
Wake up, Komugi.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.610
It's time to play.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.030
We have a shocking news update.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.360
The true purpose of the summoning

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.100
of all Republic of East Gorteau
citizens to the capital city

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.770
was a plot by the Supreme
Leader to massacre them.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.260
The body of Supreme Leader Diego
was discovered under the rubble,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.170
suggesting that the victims were
likely forced into mass suicide.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.720
But the second-in-command,
Secretary Bizeff, is still missing,

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:17.230
so some authorities believe a
revolution is the greater likelihood.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.560
Meanwhile, there has also been trouble

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.990
in the NGL region of the Mitene Union,
as international peacekeepers

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.650
have sent queries regarding refugees,

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.990
and have received no response.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.450
There have been rumors of

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.980
illicit dealings between
East Gorteau and NGL,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.210
and the international community
seeks to use this incident

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.570
as an opportunity to conduct
a more forceful investigation.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.590
Yeah, the boss did his duty.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.510
No, I wasn't there to see it.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.770
It still isn't clear yet.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.370
Yeah, we're waiting on Palm.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.950
Can we really trust her alone

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.890
to verify the King's death?

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.000
Plus, that person was captured and

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.760
converted by the enemy, yes?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.830
Well, that's a question of professionalism.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.430
It would be professional

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.460
to provide a complete report
in the safest manner possible.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
But those are the professionals who spend

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.400
all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.570
And when we field Hunters are told
to trust a partner, we trust them.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.430
We're all professionals...

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.260
But I'm the one out in the field!

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.680
I'm not sitting in an office!

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.020
The Vice Chairman's faction won't
accept that argument.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.940
If they find out, you can expect
to be questioned, at the least.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.920
Uh, I am Netero...

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.650
Chairman, thank you for a job well done.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.290
May you rest in peace.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.980
The same day, a video was streamed
online in which Netero announced

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.660
his resignation as Chairman
of the Hunter Association,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.490
and gave instructions for
choosing his successor.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.670
However, major news stories in the
government-run media overshadowed it,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.200
and only a few realized that
the video was his will.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.580
Now, let us drink.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.220
Let us drink.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.510
Drink to the human race.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:02.310
In every age, there will be good
humans and bad humans.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.250
Human life is too long
to devote to reproduction,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.280
yet too short to devote to learning,
in the helix of time.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.640
Perhaps that is why humans succumb
to desire and seek release.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:26.450
Despite the fact that life is complete
with the sun, the land, and poetry.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.920
Supreme Leader Diego (Real)
In his 30th year of retirement,
on a farm, in an unnamed country

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.190
It's over...

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.200
But it feels like we
haven't played in ages...

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.900
Playing in real life is completely different
than playing in my dreams.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.770
Yes.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.210
I thought I felt someone kick
me hard in the stomach.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.030
After that, a strange person kidnapped me...

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.400
But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.690
It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.850
I was wrong?!

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.230
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.210
I was unworthy of their loyalty...

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.770
When they stop by, I must thank them.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.230
I will relay your gratitude.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.090
I'll be seeing them soon...

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.220
I know. Let's begin.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.930
Yes!

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.920
Once, you asked my name.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.630
Y-Yes...

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.720
My name is Meruem.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.860
Meruem.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.990
It means the light that illuminates all.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.340
Meruem-sama?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.190
M-My name is Komugi...

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.480
It is an honor to know you!

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.200
I know.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.840
No...

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.510
That isn't true.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.200
I knew nothing.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:34.770
I didn't understand what really mattered.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.640
Meruem-sama?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.170
No honorific is necessary.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.410
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.810
No honorific is necessary!

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.830
B-But, I could never do that!

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.010
I would never dare address
you without an honorific!

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.700
Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will
address me without the honorific.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.530
I understand.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.850
Do I die after I've addressed
you without the honorific?

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.070
Ah, that's right.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.740
There is no need for you to die.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.000
I am not the same person I was before.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.330
You should be prepared to lose.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.990
Yes!

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.970
What do you want if you win?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.760
I would like another match!

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.620
It was a foolish question.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.880
Let's begin, then.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.770
1-5-1, marshal.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.280
9-9-1, marshal.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.710
7-9-1, pawn.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.460
2-3-1, pawn.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.900
2-7-2, musketeer.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.560
Could it be?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.580
7-1-2, fortress.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.550
This is...

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.550
Marshal

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.480
...kokoriko?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.050
Komugi, do you mean to mock me?

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.510
No.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.170
I want a sincere answer.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.650
I will not allow you to fool around.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.060
Yes, I have never fooled around
while playing Gungi.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.070
Very well.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.400
If you lose, you will die.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.490
Yes.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.540
Certain Death

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.770
Is she saying this will not
mean her certain death?

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.600
She had a number of other options.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.370
But all would only serve to lengthen the

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.680
game without increasing her chances.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.150
If she thinks she has a chance to win...

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.060
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.320
I want to see

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.060
where this goes!

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.130
4-6-2, spy.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.330
Th-This is...

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.400
She

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.840
has found a way out.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.570
That night, I realized something.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.490
Quiet!

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.990
Let me think.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.110
Here.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.110
This is the only way to go!

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.520
I should be able to checkmate her!

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.280
When she's forced closer to my position,
my advantage grows with each move.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.840
But if she slows down and allows
me a turn to attack,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.110
she can't stop the knight
and lieutenant general!

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.630
2-6-1, knight!

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.760
I reversed her new move!

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.630
What now?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.400
What is wrong?

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.420
Why do you cry?

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.240
Am I...

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.150
Am I allowed

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.400
to be so happy?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.350
Can...

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.660
Can so many

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.660
wonderful things happen to someone like me?

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.170
I suppose I must tell you the truth.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.290
I...

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.220
I have been poisoned,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.930
and I have little time.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.420
Meruem-sama...

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.730
Komugi, I wanted...

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.690
to spend my final moments
playing against you.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.290
But this poison is contagious.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.330
If you stay near me too long, you will also...

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.720
She reversed my reversal?

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.090
Meruem-sama...

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:39.960
Right now, I am very happy.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.610
I may not be worthy,

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.300
but please allow me to join you.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.000
I see...

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.740
I...

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.240
I believe

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.400
that I was born to be here today.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.950
...was born for this moment.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:23.930
Spy               Marshal

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.910
4-4-1, pawn.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.140
6-5-1, knight.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.080
2-7-2, new spy.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.150
Komugi, are you still there?

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.760
Yes, I sure am.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.360
I'm not going anywhere.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.730
4-5-1, lieutenant general.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.290
That's checkmate.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.000
Komugi, are you still here?

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.370
Yes, yes... Right here.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.210
Let's play another match.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.200
The loser goes first.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.170
Komugi...

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.010
Yes, yes? What is it?

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.740
It appears I never defeated
you a single time.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.640
What are you saying?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.010
We've just gotten started!

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.410
Yes...

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.490
1-5-1, marshal.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.670
9-5-1, marshal.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.200
Komugi, are you still here?

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.520
Yes, of course.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.090
It's your turn, Meruem-sama.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.410
I'm a little tired...

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.800
I need to take a short nap.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.050
Will

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.360
you hold my hand?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.960
Komugi?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.810
Komugi, are you there?

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.250
I can hear you.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.040
I understand.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.930
Like this?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.070
I'll wake up shortly.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.390
Will you stay by my side until I wake?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.390
I've never left your side.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.800
I'll always be here.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.470
Komugi...

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.260
Yes, yes? What is it?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.100
Thank you.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.540
You're welcome.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.230
Will you call me...

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.840
Yes?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.260
...by my name one last time?

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.320
Good night,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.640
Meruem...

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.810
I'll be joining you

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.810
soon.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.390
Next time: Homecoming x And x True Name.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.240
I'm home, Mito-san!

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.520
Welcome home, Reina-chan.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.950
Eh? What?!
