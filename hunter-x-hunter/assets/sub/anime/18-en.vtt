00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.260
Leorio!

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.790
Leorio!

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.650
Big x Time x Interview

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.660
Gon's group has been trapped by
the vipers that block the exit.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.030
But the vipers' master, Bourbon,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.150
is already dead.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.470
The one who set this trap is dead?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.420
How?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.420
I killed him.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.920
I won't tell you how.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.170
Gon, take Leorio.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.990
Okay.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.220
It's no use.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.700
You won't be able to search his body.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.170
The snakes are trained to attack

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.960
the moment anyone tries to touch
their master or to leave the cave.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.710
So you used poison to fight poison.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.040
Judging from his wounds,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.220
you must have used Neurotoxic Bees.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
He probably died from anaphylactic shock.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.980
Anaphylactic shock?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.900
When a bee stings a human,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.690
the human produces antibodies
to counter the venom.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.500
But if that human is stung again
by the same kind of bee,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.240
they experience an allergic reaction.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.110
An extreme allergic reaction

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.010
is known as anaphylactic shock.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.460
Depending on the circumstances,
it can be fatal.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.830
You got me.
That's exactly what happened.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.000
So you used bees to kill him?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.760
Bourbon was my target.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.040
After confirming that he'd
entered the cave,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.770
I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.760
and waited until it was safe to enter.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.110
Bourbon was sound asleep,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.000
but he'd already set his trap.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.800
The sleeping gas didn't reach

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.850
most of the snakes that were hiding

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.980
in cracks at the back of the cave.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.870
Well, I jumped back in time,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.940
so I wasn't bitten by snakes.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.940
But that triggered my attack switch.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.950
You keep bees up there?

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.910
If I scream or collapse,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.700
they'll attack any nearby humans.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.720
I didn't expect him to die.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.710
How could I have known that he'd
already been stung once?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.960
And I couldn't help him
because of the snakes.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.110
Well, it was beyond my control anyway.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.680
You can come back now.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.700
The problem is that he's dead,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.030
but the viper trap is still active.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.490
And we can't ask him or
look for a way to disarm it.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.350
We're trapped with no escape.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.490
Leorio...

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.310
I've already given up.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.040
We just have to wait for the
examiners to come and save us.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.460
The examiners?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.500
You're saying that they'll
rescue us from this cave?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.630
You didn't know?

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.360
Our ID tags contain a tracking device.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.150
The examiners can locate each applicant.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.650
If someone hasn't returned
by the deadline,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.770
the examiners will look for them.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.350
Though this won't work if
you lose your tag

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.060
or if someone takes it from you.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.200
Fortunately, there's only one day left.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.600
The best course would be to give up
for this year and wait for help.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.280
We cannot do that.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.700
Leorio's condition is worsening.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.410
We must take him to a
doctor immediately.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.160
The examiners won't move until
the deadline passes.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.420
If you don't have your tag,
you'll basically be left for dead.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.850
It's his own fault.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.420
I warned him.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.810
<i>Kurapika! Gon!</i>

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.960
<i>Don't come in! The snakes...!</i>

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.450
All you can do is pray that he
holds out until help arrives.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.620
<i>No, there is still a way.</i>

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.590
<i>With a good chance for success.</i>

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.050
<i>But if he isn't carrying any on his person,</i>

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.770
<i>we'll have another victim.</i>

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.700
Kurapika.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.470
Look after Leorio.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.200
Gon?

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.080
I'm sure we'll find some!

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.580
Gon...

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.080
Hey, Gon!

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.710
Wait, what are you doing?

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.460
Didn't you hear what I just said?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.490
Hello?

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.430
Gon!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.940
H-He's crazy...

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.390
Found it!

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.600
Kurapika!

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.620
Gon!

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.320
Use it on Leorio quick...

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.020
All right, you're next.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.310
Yeah...

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.440
I don't believe it...

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.270
He jumped into a nest of
poisonous snakes

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.060
to search for an antidote,
not even knowing if he had it?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.710
The odds were in his favor.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.320
What?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.590
If you're going to poison someone,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.080
you'd need the antidote at hand,
as a bargaining chip.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.030
That's true, but...

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.580
<i>That said,</i>

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.910
<i>it took an incredible amount of courage</i>

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.080
<i>to do what he just did.</i>

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.090
Leorio's condition is stabilizing.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.220
He should be fine.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.330
You must be really good friends.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.060
Hey, do you have any sleeping gas left?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.120
I do...

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.800
Would you trade it for this?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.560
Ah!

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.540
That's Bourbon's!

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.320
This gives you six points, right?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.230
Yes, that's right.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.180
But what are you going to do
with the sleeping gas?

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.950
Put all the snakes to sleep,
so we can escape.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.710
It'd be more effective than when
I sprayed the gas from outside.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.710
Within five minutes, the entire
cave will fill with gas,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.210
and the snakes will be asleep.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.280
But it'll take five minutes!

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.090
No one can hold their breath that long.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.520
There's no point if we put
ourselves to sleep in the process.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.610
Nine minutes and forty-four seconds.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.220
Huh?

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.360
That's my record.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.500
I'll hold my breath and carry
everyone out of here.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.220
I can't trust you.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.960
You might escape by yourself.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.850
You really think he'd do that,
after jumping into

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.830
a nest of poisonous snakes to save Leorio?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.860
Trust me.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.330
I'll get you out of here!

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.320
It's ready.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.120
On my signal, release the gas.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.510
Got it.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.780
<i>199, 200,</i>

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.790
<i>201, 202, 203,</i>

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.790
<i>204, 205, 206, 207...</i>

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.580
Yes!

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.190
Well, I'll leave Bourbon's tag with you,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.450
so the examiners will find you.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.570
If I give Leorio your tag,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.450
he'll have six points and pass.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.580
Consider it the fee for carrying
you out of there.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.770
Sorry.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.430
The Fourth Phase of the exam
has just ended.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.690
Will the applicants please return

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.560
to the starting point at once?

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.980
You will be given one hour of extra time.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.570
If you do not return during this time,
you will fail the exam.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.700
Furthermore, you are not allowed
to exchange tags

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.630
after reaching the starting point.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.870
Anyone caught swapping tags
will be disqualified.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:14.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.170
Ponzu

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.100
Then we will now check the
tags of everyone here!

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.920
#44 Hisoka-san.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.950
#53, Pokkle-san.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.950
#99, Killua-san.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.960
#301, Gittarackur-san.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.220
#191, Bodoro-san.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.700
#294, Hanzo-san.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.420
So six applicants have passed?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.080
Oh?

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.700
Gon.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.090
Ah, three more arrive at the last second.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.590
Killua.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.100
And now for the last few members...

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.980
#404, Kurapika-san.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.540
#403, Leorio-san.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.700
And #405, Gon-san.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.440
These nine applicants have passed

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.520
the Fourth Phase of the exam!

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.780
Six of the nine are rookies?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.380
Marvelous, marvelous.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.380
Has this ever happened before?

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.690
Hmm, there's a trend where

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.740
we'll go many years without
a single rookie qualifying.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.030
Then suddenly,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.350
we'll have a whole bunch
of promising newbies.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.240
This is the fourth time I've seen it happen.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.530
By the way, what are we doing
for the Final Phase?

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.410
Oh, right.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.980
You haven't told us yet.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.910
Yes, about that...

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.660
I intend to have them participate
in a rather peculiar fight.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.540
Hmm? A rather peculiar fight?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.810
First, I want to talk to each of the

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.970
nine remaining applicants.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.330
Pathetic...

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.560
I needed the two of you

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.370
to do everything for me during
the Fourth Phase.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.700
I promise I'll return the favor.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.490
So...

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.820
Thanks.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.440
I have an announcement for all applicants.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.560
The chairman wishes to interview
the remaining candidates.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.670
Interview?

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.370
When your number is called,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.570
please come to the first reception room,
on the second floor.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.440
Then we will start with #44, Hisoka-sama.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.090
Well, have a seat.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.220
Don't tell me that this is
the exam's Final Phase.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.550
It may be related...

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.410
I'll just be asking a few questions
to satisfy my curiosity.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.320
First, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.810
I'm not particularly interested in
becoming a Hunter, but...

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.860
But?

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.620
A Hunter License can be very useful.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.550
Oh, any examples?

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.750
For example,

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.620
Hunters usually can't be punished
when they kill someone.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.490
I see.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.630
Then I'll move on to the next question.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.240
Which of the other eight applicants

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.380
are you keeping an eye on?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.010
#99.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.260
Ah...

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.190
#405 is also on my radar,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.860
but it's #99 I'm keeping an eye on.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.400
I would love to take him on one day.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.680
One last question.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.030
Which of the other eight applicants
would you least want to fight?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.710
That would be #405.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.980
Though #99 is also up there.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.950
If you're asking whom I least
want to fight at this moment,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.920
my answer would be #405.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.290
Ah, I understand.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.600
I should mention that the one I most
want to fight at this moment

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.270
is you.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.750
Yep, nice job.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.560
You're excused.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.070
<i>That old man is too crafty...</i>

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.320
<i>He left himself so undefended,
I lost my edge.</i>

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.330
I'm watching out for #404.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.670
He looks to be the most
balanced applicant left.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.830
I definitely don't want to fight #44.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.920
To be honest, I doubt I can beat him.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.280
Has to be Gon.
Since we're the same age.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.240
I don't want to fight #53.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.350
I don't think it'd be a
very interesting fight.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.650
I've got my eye on #44.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.570
He has real presence.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.960
#405 and #99 are still children.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.950
I couldn't bring myself to fight them.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.210
#99.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.370
#44.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.650
Who am I watching out for?

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.680
#44, Hisoka.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.770
A lot's happened, so I've
been watching him.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.220
I can't choose one out of
#99, #403, and #404.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.990
It has to be #44.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.440
He's the most dangerous one here.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.650
And #44 is the one I least want to fight.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.320
I'm watching #405 for positive reasons,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.420
and #44 for negative reasons.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.420
If I'm given ample reason,
I'll fight anyone.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.830
If not, I would prefer not to fight anyone.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.400
#405.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.940
I owe him, and I hope that
he passes the exam.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.550
So I'm hoping I don't have to fight #405.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.810
Hmm, the results were more lopsided
than I was expecting.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:43.510
Gon.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.060
We've reached the Final Phase
of the exam.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.290
Yeah.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.070
Heart

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.070
Yes, that's good.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.710
I've drawn up the bracket.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.920
Huh?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.580
What is this?

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.590
Ch-Chairman?

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.790
What?

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.590
Are you serious about this?

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.340
Dead serious.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.970
He certainly has a serious expression.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.850
Th-That's a serious expression?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.850
Winning will make them Hunters.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.560
Gon...

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.040
Hmm?

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.200
Did something happen during
the Fourth Phase?

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.600
When we met up,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.370
you were acting a little strange.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.240
And you've been somewhat subdued

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.270
since we left Zevil Island.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.940
My target was Hisoka.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.680
I waited for the perfect chance
and stole his tag,

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.660
but someone else was tailing me,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.440
and he got me with a poisoned dart.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.060
Soon after, Hisoka took back his tag

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.480
from the person who got me,
and he left it with me.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.080
He said that I owed him now.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.700
Hisoka said that?

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.760
I told him I didn't need his help,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.200
and he sent me flying.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.400
<i>I'll only take it back</i>

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.880
<i>when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.</i>

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.260
I was so mad

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.090
that I couldn't do anything against him...

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.040
After that, I was pretty
miserable and lonely.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.040
I felt so helpless,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.760
I wanted company...

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.170
I wanted to help someone,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.060
I guess.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.850
That's why I was looking for you two.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.210
Gon.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.380
Leorio and I have only been able

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.250
to make it this far because of you.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.650
We're truly grateful.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.610
I'd also like to thank you.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.130
Gon has deepened his bond
with his friends.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.540
And the nine remaining
applicants are about

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.360
to begin the exam's Final Phase.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.680
Next time: Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.100
Then how am I supposed to win?

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.320
Just do it!
