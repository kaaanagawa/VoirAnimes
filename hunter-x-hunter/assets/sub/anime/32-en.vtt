The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.490
You can make your body harder,

A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

A technique to create an
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.020 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.430
Naturally,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.770
my double is no mere illusion.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.110
It exists as a second me until I send it away.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.260
You know this after suffering
an attack from my double.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.370
In other words, you must fight both of my selves.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.710
This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
completed through the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.590
I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.590
A x Surprising x Win

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.600
Kastro has used <i>Nen</i> to create
a double of himself.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.910
And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.600
has severed Hisoka's right arm.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.190
Who will emerge victorious?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.580
What's this?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.930
Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.130
Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.670
Wow!

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.440
His right arm has disappeared,
and cards rain down!

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.900
What does he intend to do?!

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.040
Now, then...

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.360
I have cards here, from one to thirteen.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.780
Pick a number from these,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.370
and picture it in your head.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.120
Pick a number?

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.380
Are you ready?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.410
Once you have your number, add four,

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.130
and double the result.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.140
After that, subtract six, and divide by two.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.080
Finally, subtract your original number,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.390
and what do you have?

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.060
Um...

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.970
Hey, did he say to subtract six?

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.900
Jeez, I don't know!

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.400
I already know your answer.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.120
The answer is one.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.730
He's right!

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.950
How?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.130
Seriously?

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.000
This is very strange...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.260
Insane!

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.050
A satanic magic trick!

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.770
And he's incorporated his own
injury into the trick!

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.890
Why is he so calm?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.660
The trick is worth no points.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.890
That had no effect on the match,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.790
but he's performing tricks!

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.770
Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.280
You may keep this as a souvenir.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.060
Scumbag.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.160
I will sever your left arm,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.240
so you can never mock anyone again.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.350
Did you not hear me the first time?

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.750
You may have it.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.630
Your wish will be granted!

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.920
Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.480
Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.080
What is he thinking?!

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.090
What?

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.150
As expected, you attacked with your double.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.230
Had you, yourself, attacked,
I would have countered.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.950
With this.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.950
Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.160
This is another magic trick.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.210
Can you guess the secret behind it?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.610
He's lying...

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.190
He's obviously employing Nen
to accomplish this feat.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.340
But what type of Nen is he using?

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.920
What's wrong?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.600
Are you frightened?

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.560
You're surprised because you
don't understand my trick.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.860
That's how magic works.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.560
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.870
But now I understand your ability.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.250
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.870
And I know how to counter that attack.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.220
It's quite unfortunate.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.190
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.700
That was why I spared your life.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.120
Here is a prediction...

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.890
You will die, in a frenzied dance.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.650
Silence!

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.530
H-How did he pick me out?

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.700
Doubles are created in the original's image,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.790
so they tend to be pristine.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.660
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.670
Oh?

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.340
Did you not realize this?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.350
What is going on here?

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.030
This sequence of events is
impossible to understand!

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.740
Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.720
Don't bother.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.360
I hit you in the chin,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.240
so you'll have difficulty moving for a while.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.250
Meaning that you won't be able
to evade my next attack.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.520
What?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.250
Where did this attack come from?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.100
No, I don't have time for that...

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.720
I must use a double to block the cards!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.220
You can't create another double.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.710
You need intense focus to
create a double with <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.650
The only reason you were able
to use doubles freely

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.610
was because you had a normal state of mind.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.700
Using <i>Nen</i> to replicate and manipulate

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.830
something as complex as a human being

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.960
is extremely difficult.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.650
Just how difficult is it?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.980
By the time you've learned to use a double,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.930
you've forgotten how to use
<i>Nen</i> for anything else.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.930
I call that running out of memory.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.250
You lost because you wasted memory space.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.080
Kastro can no longer stand!

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.110
Hisoka wins by knockout!

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.530
Hisoka...

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.390
Good work.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.530
Now, show me that injury.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.730
I was never absolutely certain,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.120
but today's match confirmed it.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.770
You are an idiot.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.620
Perhaps.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.650
Why do you endanger yourself this way?

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.630
Was that meant as a
performance or something?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.930
Who knows?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.640
Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.650
I'll stop your bleeding first.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.040
Hey, hey.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.190
Please try to be gentle.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.040
Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.360
I'll start with the left arm.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.680
Here I go.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.270
<i>Nen Stitches.</i>

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.680
Nen Stitches

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.810
Okay, all done.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.240
Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.570
Basically, it's one hundred percent connected.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.160
An excellent job.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.960
Next,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.290
I'll do your right arm.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.960
Hold it yourself this time.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.760
I'm always mesmerized by your skill.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.650
Perhaps I get myself injured

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.440
so I can watch you work your magic.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.930
Right.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.320
Twenty million for the left arm.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.700
Fifty million for the right.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.440
Pay up. Now.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.030
I'll send the money to your account.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.250
All right.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.840
You can treat the rest of
your injuries yourself.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.950
You could provide better service.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.760
You should be able to manage
with your Bungee Gum

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.460
and Texture Surprise.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.250
Oh...

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.460
I should probably conceal this.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.470
That way,

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.690
they'll think my arms were
healed during the match.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.980
This is an ordinary scarf,
with no special features.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.480
I use Bungee Gum

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.850
to attach it to my arm.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.480
Then I use Texture Surprise
to create a layer of skin.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.990
He's so fast...

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.680
That was fast enough to fool a </i>Nen<i> master

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.970
into believing the arm had actually healed,

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.500
before he even knew what was happening.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.500
Next, I'll do the left.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.010
Bungee Gum...

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.510 line:20%
Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.720
He molds his aura into a substance

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.510
with the properties of rubber and gum.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.620
It can stretch, swiftly contract,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.450
adhere to most substances,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.520
and be removed at any time.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.520
By the way, I call this Bungee Gum
because when I was a child,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.520
that was the name of my
favorite chewing gum.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.530
I didn't need to know that.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.030
Texture Surprise...

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:30.040 line:20%
Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.460
He combines aura with the power of his imagination,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.500
to reproduce the appearance of skin.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.770
Essentially, it's a high-quality copy,
so you can tell it's fake if you touch it.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.540
However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill...

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.080
The name Texture Surprise
comes from the stickers

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.470
that were included with a popular snack

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.300
a while back.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.310
Like I said, I didn't need to know that.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.740
But weren't you impressed by my application

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.500
of these two abilities during the fight?

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.380
Huh?

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.320
You saw everything, didn't you?

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.960
Well, yeah...

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.500
As a distraction,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.680
you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.330
while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.280
stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.840
The aura from each was also tied

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.340
to your right arm.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.910
Additionally, you connected aura to
the thirteen cards on the floor,

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.600
and held the ends with your left hand.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.600
Then,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.020
when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.900
You may keep this as a souvenir.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.420
the aura in your left hand was released.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.400
And connected.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.910
The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.170
But Kastro never noticed.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.270
You employed one of the basic techniques,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.640
<i>Zetsu</i>, to help mask your aura.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.930
However, there was a flaw...

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.870
Yes, someone trained in <i>Ren</i>,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.010
another of the basic techniques,

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.190
could have focused the <i>Nen</i> in their eyes,

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.870
to see through your plan.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.690
That's why you

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.690
used that twisted magic trick
to throw him off guard,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.700
while you pretended to be
reserving your strength.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.650
It even worked as camouflage,
convincing him that your lack of aura

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.570
was a sign of confidence.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.960
After meticulously confirming
that your plan was working,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.460
you extended a thread of
aura from your left hand,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.920
the same one holding the cards,
and connected it to Kastro's chin.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.470
Your preparations were now complete.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.010
You'd already used Texture Surprise

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.730
to alter the scarf on the floor
to resemble human skin.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.480
And so,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.820
when Kastro attacked your left arm,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.650
you activated the Bungee Gum

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.990
between your right arm and
the scarf on the floor.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.770
Your arm was restored,

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.780
and the scarf concealed the wound,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.500
leaving everyone convinced that
your right arm was restored.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:22.030
However, this performance actually
helped Kastro to calm down.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.420
It made no sense for a severed arm

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.510
to reappear in a pristine state...

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:35.520
Kastro realized that I was
using <i>Nen</i>, not magic.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.980
But you didn't miss the subtle change
in his psychological state.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.500
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.530
But now I understand your ability.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.180
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.540
And I know how to counter that attack.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.070
It's quite unfortunate.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.540
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.780
That was why I spared your life.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.680
Kastro was about to recover.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.110
Here is a prediction...

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.680
You will die, in a frenzied dance.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.680
But then you pushed him over the edge.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.190
Silence!

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.900
H-How did he pick me out?

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.570
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.100
You exposed the weakness of his doubles.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.380
But had he stayed composed,
he had a fair chance.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.420
However...

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.420
Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.100
And he lost.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.700
You realize that those two abilities

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.110
are perfect for you.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.670
As opposed to Kastro's doubles,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.690
if my opponent knows of my abilities,

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.000
I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.000
Well,

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.910
I'm off.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.920
Already?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.790
My job is done, so I'm not sticking around.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.130
Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.010
don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.210
Oh, that's right.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.020
I came here for a reason.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.480
I have new orders.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.330
All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.010
by noon, August 30th, not just
those who find it convenient.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.530
Will the boss be coming?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.530
Most likely.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.810
This could be our biggest job yet.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.990
If you skip this one,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.850
the boss might hunt you down himself.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.910
How very scary.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.050
Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.550
A pity.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.700
Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.980
It was boring.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.570
Did Hisoka win?

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.580
I was lying.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.580
It was an incredible fight.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.590
I hate to admit this, but I have
no idea how Hisoka won.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.410
You couldn't tell?

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.590
Gon,

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.100
we need to learn more about <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.180
Yeah!

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.870
He doesn't talk.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.240
He doesn't talk about the past.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.380
He has no interest in the past.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.880
By tomorrow, I imagine he'll
have forgotten Kastro's face.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.890
He doesn't associate with others.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.190
He's his own man.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.650
Because he believes himself

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.580
to be the strongest.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.130
Oh, I forgot to remove this.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.640
Spider...

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.740
I found some new toys to play with.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.820
I suppose it's time to start the hunt.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.150
Hisoka has been masquerading
as a Phantom Troupe member.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:43.020
To him, the Phantom Troupe
is simply another target.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:14.910
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.530
Today, we introduce Kastro.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.740
A 200s-class warrior.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.790
He can use the Tiger Bite Fist.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.610
He can create a clone of himself with <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.500
Combines release and
incarnation techniques,

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.150
Doubles are tough to deal with.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.770
With this double, I can use the real Tiger Bite Fist!

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.830
to duplicate himself.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.170
The True Tiger Bite Fist!

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.260
Next time: An x Empty x Threat!

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.170
Ah... Ah...

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.260
Achoo!

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.520
Do I have a cold?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.080
I bet someone's talking about you
behind your back.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.510
Is it Mito-san?
