00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.610
The calendar loses a precious component.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.760
The remaining months gather to mourn.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.240
The mourners play a melody,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.010
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.050
Assault x And x Impact

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 line:20%
We will be making an emergency stop.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.000 line:20%
Please watch your step.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.920
Did something happen?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.070 line:20%
We are currently evaluating the situation.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.340
Beats me.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.300
It's me.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.990
Are they here?

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.540
Yeah, it's gotta be them!

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.060
They're the only ones strong enough to fight

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.750
a whole crowd alone!

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.410
Hey... Hey!

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.260
Damn!

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690
Figure out how many enemies we're up against!

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.840
Listen up! Do whatever
it takes to stop them!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.230
Do not let them near this building!

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.430
They're late...

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.870
Our escort isn't here yet?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.710
Their names are Melody and Basho.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.540
All traffic in Yorknew City has been stopped.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.790
They're probably stuck.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.180
It's dangerous for Neon to be here!

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.720
Isn't there any way to evacuate her?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.800
The ambulance we requested is on its way.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.300
Please wait a little longer.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.710
Ambulance?

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.530
Yes, that's right.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.340
Something's wrong here.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.940
The man who entered
the building with Neon

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.530
and then called for a doctor...

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.310
Boss.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.900
Kurapika, don't take one step away

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.130
from my daughter until the ambulance arrives.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.110
Got it?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.070
But my assignment is to kill
the Phantom Troupe.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.340
At the time, I thought that
Neon would already be home.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.700
But instead, she's unconscious here,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.040
exposed to the Troupe.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.140
I absolutely must ensure Neon's safety.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.890
Stay here for the time being.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.210
I'm begging you.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.260
Understood.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.620
What a pity...

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.980
They aren't putting up much of a fight.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.790
Well, I guess it was stupid to expect more—

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.910
Damn...

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.760
They're crazier than I've heard,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.290
launching a frontal attack with ten people.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.190
Man...

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.890
When did this place turn into a battlefield?

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.480
Where is the patient?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.050
There's nothing to prove that you
aren't a Phantom Troupe member.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.900
One funny move, and I'll blow your head off.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.390
Follow me.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.160
Please allow me to check you all.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.170
What's that?

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.790
Bastard...

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.000
Currently, all trains have been stopped.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.800
For your safety, please wait patiently.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.060
I'm not getting any reception down here.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.830
And we don't know when the
trains will start moving again.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.190
That settles it... We'll have to run.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.230
You were hired to be an assassin,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.540
so stop hiding in this room, and go fight.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.420
Or did you get scared once
the Troupe showed up?

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.840
Oh, actually...

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.740
I requested that Kurapika stay here.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.900
I understand that he's been
hired by the Ten Dons,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.100
but I was worried about my daughter.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.500
I don't intend to sell you out.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.180
But you're being paid well,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.110
so I expect you to do your job.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.360
I agree

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.220
that I must do something.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.740
I could at least patrol this building.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.400
Yes, I suppose.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.740
But you must come immediately if I call.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.430
My daughter's safety comes first.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.660
Understood.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.550
How long do we have to wait?

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.010
Hey, what's going on outside?

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.260
I can hear explosions nearby!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.410
When will the auction start?

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.660
Explain what's going on.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.770
P-Please wait a little longer.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.270
Tell us whether the auction's still on or not!

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.610
Everyone here is a gang leader or a big shot.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.280
They're endangering themselves to prove

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.530
that they aren't afraid of the Troupe.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.210
Return my phone!

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.080
I've no idea what's happening outside.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.260
I need my weapons, too!

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.290
As you already know, weapons are banned.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.660
What if they get inside?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.050
Are we supposed to fight with our bare hands?!

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.260
It's becoming chaotic here...

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.670
The auctioneers and handlers will lose control

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.420
of the situation very soon.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.670
Hello?

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.060
Oh, Kurapika?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.810
Huh?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.700
Whew, we finally got a hold of you.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.510
Is this Gon?!

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.330
Yep, can you talk right now?

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.270
Uh, sorry, I'm in the middle of something.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.430
I'll call you back.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.520
Wait!

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.810
Can you give me one minute?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.320
I have something to tell you.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.830
Killua and I ran into the Troupe.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.270
Actually, they caught us.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.330
What were you guys thinking?!

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.910
Do you realize how dangerous they are?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.340
Let me talk.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.330
I thought I knew, but after we met
them, it became painfully clear.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.880
They're strong.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.240
Right now, we have no chance against them.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.910
That's why we need your assistance.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.850
We want to help.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.250
That's ridiculous.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.210
I won't help you get yourselves killed.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.410
Don't you want to know where their base is?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.860
I have my own sources of information.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.940
Do you know all of their powers?

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.240
Enough! Just stay away from the Troupe!

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.890
You're the chain user who killed
one of their members, right?

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.750
They're looking everywhere for you.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.890
If you won't treat us as friends or equals,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.430
we'll do whatever we must to help!

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.890
Kurapika...

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.790
One of their members cried in front of us.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.620
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.650
I got really mad after seeing that.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.510
I couldn't let that go.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.740
We want to stop them!

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.570
Please, Kurapika...

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.640
I'll call you back.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.550
If you won't treat us as friends or equals...

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.120
We want to stop them!

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.780
Here they come!

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.510
Don't let them escape!

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.160
I can feel the heat!

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.300
Someone's coming!

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.960
Does he have a gun?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.080
Who's stationed here?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.820
I-It's no use.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.960
They're too strong.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.790
We don't stand a chance...

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.990
How strong are they?!

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.790
This strong!

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.090
Damn it!

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.580
Aw, he broke.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.220
I need to find my next machine.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.890
Are you okay?

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.610
I found the corpse of one of the assassins!

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.840
Someone's already inside the building!

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.990
Damn it.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.540
It's hopeless!

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.470
Hey, don't run away!

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.670
Fight!

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.140
Man, what's going on?

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.510
It's me.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.050
Where's our backup?

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.120
What are you doing?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.300
They should be there any moment.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.910
We'll be arriving shortly...

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.110
You can't mean...

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.300
The two thousand men that were
supposed to assemble here

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.240
have all been wiped out?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.030
Now what?

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.230
There are Troupe members inside the building.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.680
It's me, Bean!

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.440
Get the Ten Dons on the line.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.680
It's urgent!

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.080
The intruder must be a member of the Troupe.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.690
Their objective is to steal the rest of the
merchandise and avenge their comrade.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.200
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.990
That's what I wanted!

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.450
Hey! Enough already!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.970
Give us the weapons we handed over!

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.250
But the rules state that...

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.090
To hell with the rules!

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.540
Do you understand our situation?!

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.880
I know you've got professional assassins

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.070
wandering around this place!

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.930
If you're gonna depend on those freaks,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.720
you might as well let us fight!

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.190
My name is Zeno Zoldyck.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.660
The famous Zoldyck family of assassins!

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.780
The Ten Dons called in these monsters?

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.030
At the moment, one bandit has
infiltrated this building.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.160
He has killed a number of the assassins

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.710
that your people hired.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.510
Even if you were fully armed,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.900
it would take me seven seconds
to kill the lot of you.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.260
The enemy is capable of a similar feat.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.700
If you understand, shut up and wait.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.230
It's a different story if you want to die...

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.540
Well?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.510
A single strike from behind.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.490
Beautiful.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.820
His presence was only exposed
for a brief instant,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.070
and barely any trace remains.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.590
I suppose I'll have to use <i>En</i>.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.310
It's an exhausting technique.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.670
Let's start from the roof and head down...

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.410
This building's radius is one hundred meters.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.320
Will you be okay, old man?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.190
Fool, if I wanted, I could
handle three times that.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.200
This job is hardly worth the pay...

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.980
You're late, Kurapika!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.740
Hurry back right now.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.370
Stay at Neon's side!

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.910
Right, I'm on my way.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.610
Damn!

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.170
We meet again.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.760
You remember me?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.800
How could I forget?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.340
You killed one of my people.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.730
It was difficult.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.580
Careful, old man.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.600
He can steal your techniques.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.170
This could be hard, fighting one on two.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.080
It takes a quality knife to scratch me.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.930
Looks to be a mid-era Ben's knife.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.040
That shape...

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.930
It's poisoned?

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.810
You okay?

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.730
I'm just fine.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.390
Just fine?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:49.740
A tenth of a milligram will
completely paralyze a whale.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.600
So you can steal other people's <i>Nen</i>?

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.140
You must be a Specialist.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.440
I would consider you a threat if you
could freely use the powers you steal.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.280
However, you must take risks
to take those abilities.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.510
A technique that strong must
have its drawbacks...

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.200
I would guess

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.640
you must clear four or five conditions
before you can steal an ability.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.390
Correct.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.020
The old man's a difficult opponent.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.640
It will be difficult to clear those
conditions while you fight us.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.500
Meaning that you won't be able

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.400
to steal our abilities while we fight.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.910
Proven by your need to use a
poisoned knife as a deterrent.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.750
Correct again.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.160
I have no choice.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.300
Silva, I'll need your support.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.750
Once I lock him in place,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.550
kill him, even if you have
to kill me with him.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.300
Understood.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.280
He focused his aura into his hand.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.990
He has incredible potential.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.520
I won't be able to block that attack.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.330
Skill Hunter:
Bandit's Secret

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.960
A mantle...
A Conjurer ability?

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.270
This could be difficult...

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.490
Even if it's a stolen ability,
I can't attack recklessly

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.860
without knowing what it's capable of.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.860
That would be an ordinary fighter's reaction...

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.500
Dragon Head: Long-Tou Xi-Hua

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.130
Dragon Lance

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.270
I see now...

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.370
His power is to seal other people's abilities

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.310
in that Conjured book

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.980
letting him use them freely.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.910
In return, when he uses another ability,

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.540
he must hold that book
in his hands at all times.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.670
The mantle is also a Conjured item.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.860
He has shown no signs of taking the offensive,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.380
but he's trying to close the gap between us.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.570
So it's a defensive tool that can be used

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.230
to close the distance and counterattack.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.060
Which means I have no reason
not to fight from a distance.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.110
Then I wait for my chance, and grab it.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.530
This old man is incredible.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.320
He managed to read my mind in a flash.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.280
I'm guessing I can't capture him alive.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.540
When he shuts the book,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.830
the ability he withdrew also vanishes?

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.750
In any case, he's quite talented.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.010
He dodges each of my old man's
attacks at the last second,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.760
leaving me no opening to attack.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.710
He's physically stronger than before.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.900
Since we don't know what abilities he has,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.700
we can't finish him off

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.620
without being willing to risk our lives.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.210
Now! Kill him!

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.130
A thundering boom resounded
through Yorknew City.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.730
Kurapika had no idea that the shock wave

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.110
would lead to an unexpected development.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:15.960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.500
Today, we introduce Shalnark.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.740
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.480
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.660
He's smart, knowledgeable, and calculating.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.870
With his sharp mind,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.910
His <i>Nen</i> ability places an antenna on targets,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.960
he's tasked with gathering
information and data analysis.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.500
letting him control them with his cell phone.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.120
<i>Black Voice!</i>

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.700
Next time: Fake x And x Psyche!

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.240
Kopitor?

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.810
Kotorpi?

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.410
Kortopi!
