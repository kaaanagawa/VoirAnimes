WEBVTT

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.920
No way...

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.600
Where did he go, in that condition?!

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.940
Shoot...

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.990
Fake X And X Real

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.300
You intend to fight?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.480
You will abandon your original plan, and
commit yourself to a baseless assumption?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.060
You really believe...

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.060
Smoky Jail, undo!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.340
I see you've made your decision.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.500
Once I stopped to think about it,
it was pretty simple.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.040
You used your cocoon after I played my card.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.640
Since you went into hiding
only after learning my agenda,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.620
I knew that was your ability,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.470
and that it was a trap.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.480
Your lack of reaction when I lifted
my pipe to strike confirmed it.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.520
It made no sense that you showed
no sign of reacting at all.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.790
Fifteen minutes.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.900
That was how long I expected you to take

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.210
before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.470
During that time, I intended to slip
through the smoke and move freely.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.230
You trapped me within that barrier
to separate me from the King, yes?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.460
Meaning, as long as your
prison of smoke was there,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.560
your allies would see it and
conclude that I was still inside.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.920
I decided to take advantage

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.260
of that misconception, and
quietly dispose of your friends.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.020
I knew you would hesitate long enough
to give me plenty of time to act.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.420
You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes
waiting in front of an empty cocoon?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.760
You really underestimated me.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.560
No, on the contrary, it appears...

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.740
I overestimated you!

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.890
He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.060
If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail,
I wouldn't have seen a thing!

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.000
You should have waited longer...

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.290
Because my strategy was a last resort.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.170
To be honest, I was upset by the
fact that I'd been trapped.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.080
Not a very good diversion strategy.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.530
You just contradicted yourself.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.760
You made it through the smoke just fine!

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.690
At that point, that was all there was to it.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.190
I was under the impression that
you were a more capable soldier...

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.430
One who would carry out his original
plan and be faithful to his mission.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.950
However, you made some wild guesses
and removed the barrier.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.950
I must thank you.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.910
Thank you.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.340
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.610
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.110
Thank you.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.960
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.800
Deep Purple!

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.530
Run!

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.540
I can't destroy them?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.780
They just break up and reform?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.780
He's invincible?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.790
Thank you! Bye-bye!

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.000
Don't be fooled...

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.890
He's playing mind games!

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.540
My decision to attack the
cocoon was the best option.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.430
No, the moment I second-guess myself,
I've played into his hands.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.550
My next job

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.860
is to predict his objective, and stop him...

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.390
To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.310
to find and eliminate my companions,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.550
and to reunite with the King!

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.810
That must be it...

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.730
His interests are consistent with mine.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.320
There's no problem!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.580
I'll take this!

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.090
He's fast!

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.840
I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.800
He got me...

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.960
I can't use any other abilities.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.680
If Deep Purple is undone,
I'll be completely helpless!

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
I'll have to find a way to get by,
using Deep Purple alone.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.110
Yo, are you

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.240
the esper?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.250
What'd you do with Shoot, huh?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.750
What?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.500
Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.870
The maximum number I could
produce in my current state.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.260
I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.270
I see what you're doing...

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.480
I'll let you hit me once.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.020
But in return...

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.000
I'll take your life!

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.240
Okay, no one's here.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.590
This is our chance to escape.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.540
Let's go.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.240
Man, they said we'd be safe here.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.280
I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:16.030
Since my stomach shrunk, that probably
means Cheetu-sama's dead...

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.560
And I haven't heard anything from
Flutter, so I guess that's it.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.060
I'll leave to become a Queen!

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.060
I'll make you my second-in-command.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.330
How's that?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.070
Help...

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.590
Please...

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.200
get me out of here...

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.200
Help!

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.100
Oh, Secretary Bizeff...

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.070
You're in trouble.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.250
I can't move my legs...

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.970
Whatever, let's go.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.170
This looks dangerous.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.300
What? Wait... Please!

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.450
I'm going to die!

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.320
No can do... I can't move all that.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.890
Then, could you call for help?

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.960
Like, seriously...

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.940
I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.510
The boss is missing, our link
with the King is gone,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.780
and the palace is a mess.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.450
I have no reason to stay here!

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.910
I'll give you whatever reward you want!

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.660
There are mountains of treasure underground!

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.670
If you help me, I'll give you anything you want.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.260
So please pull me out!

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.340
Where underground?

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.230
There's an area for the Supreme
Leader beyond the shelter.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.840
I've been managing the treasure inside.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.820
I'm the only one with access...

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.430
You'll give me anything I want?

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.530
You'd better keep your promise.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.730
Or I'll kill you!

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.550
Treasure! Treasure!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.790
Treasure, treasure, treasure!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.360
It's over...

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.430
This nation is finished.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.310
That was clearly proven

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.220
when the air assault began before
I was able to make any arrangements.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:23.230
They're probably calling the Ants biological
weapons, to use them as an excuse...

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.610
If I'm captured by the Federation,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.590
they'll force me to confess for a cover
story and throw me in prison for life,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.460
or they'll execute me, so I can't talk.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.190
<i>I won't let them capture me...</i>

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.860
<i>I'm going to escape!</i>

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.890
The smoke-user is now out of action.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.660
Now, I'll go back to the palace,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.510
evaluate the current situation,
and return to the King.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.270
Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him,
the King will only find me a nuisance.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.930
Beelzebub!

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.270
Lord of the Flies
Beelzebub

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.960
Go forth, my clones...

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.030
Identify the location and status of
every person inside the palace!

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.890
Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.790
to disassemble into copies of himself
as small as one billionth his size.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.100
He was able to control the size
and number of copies produced,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.770
and the smaller the copies,
the more he could produce.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.280
However, his main body,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.180
which served as a control center,
could only be reduced to a bee's size.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.400
Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.040
my main body could not have escaped.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.880
My combat capacity would
have been reduced by half.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.530
I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.260
must know the incomparable difference in
strength between a clone and your own body.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.310
Now that my main body is free,
I have no weaknesses.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.170
You have lost.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.910
You should have been more careful.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.120
If you had, then when you realized

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.840
the cocoon was empty,
you should have wondered

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.390
whether what had been inside it
had actually escaped the barrier.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.410
And if I had spoken to you
from outside the barrier,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.520
you should have wondered whether
that was my real self.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.340
The plan I executed was an act of desperation.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.160
I could attempt to confuse your allies,
but my clones are mere husks.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.310
Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.670
even if it took a few casualties,
they would have noticed

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.920
that my clones were fakes!

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.980
Had you comprehended the truth,
and realized that my main body

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.180
remained within the barrier,

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.940
you would have understood my
ability, and searched for me.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.800
If you had done so,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.820
I would have had no way to
fight you in my reduced state...

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.600
In other words, if you had maintained
the barrier as per your original goal,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.100
your allies may have suffered a bit,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.660
but you would have been able to defeat me.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.500
And I was ten-percent resolved
to accept that fate.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.040
Your emotions were perfectly
aligned to accomplish that.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.660
I suppose the explosion
must have thrown you off.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.260
A pity...

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.850
However, I am now free.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.810
Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.620
From the start of the mission,
Morel's condition was less than optimal.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:10.480
His exhaustion and impatience, combined
with the extreme tension of the situation,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.710
clearly led him to the hasty decision
to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.340
However, he arrived at the
perfect time to support Knuckle,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.610
keeping him from engaging Youpi alone.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.160
As a result, it could be said that
he made the correct decision

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.640
to remove Smoky Jail at that time.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.510
And it was more than simply
a product of coincidence.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.030
It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of
experience played a role in saving him.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.220
Upon entering the palace,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.110
Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.590
against that of his allies.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.670
Subconsciously, he knew that they
had underestimated the enemy.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.670
When he realized the length of time his allies
could hold out was shorter than anticipated,

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:11.420
he was led to attack the cocoon in order
to avoid struggling with the pros and cons

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.240
of removing Smoky Jail to go help them.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.690
Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge
of the battlefield, saved his comrades.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:29.620
The real one's hidden among the fakes,
trying to attack me, right?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.290
This time, I'll land a counter on you!

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.920
Five were taken out...

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.460
I have eighty-four left!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.570
The smoke ones are fake.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.760
They feel completely different.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.140
When the real one lands a hit, I'll know.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.520
That's when you'll be finished!

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.260
Seventy-five left!

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.610
Seventy-two...

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.650
Seventy...

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.910
Pitou and the woman are on the
west tower's second floor.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.240
Pitou appears to be healing the woman.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.240
A boy, who appears to be an
enemy, is sitting nearby.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.420
Three near the entrance to
the underground shelter...

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.730
Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.510
They may be heading underground.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.690
Welfin is behind them.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.290
He appears to be following them.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.940
The woman was injured by the dragon spears.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.260
But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.950
Could he be acquainted with the woman?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.450
One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower...

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.070
The human captured a few days ago.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.160
It will be born soon.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.130
Oh, this area's crazy...

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.580
There are lots of enemies.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.090
One, two, three...

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.280
But Youpi is taking them out quickly.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.590
Youpi and approximately fifty enemies
are in the north area of the palace!

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.180
It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.470
Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.260
Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.420
Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.360
Only one of the thugs is real,
while the rest are made of smoke.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.190
The number of puppets is not increasing

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.930
because he needs the pipe to make more.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.370
It'll take Youpi less than a minute
to find the real one.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.130
The King is gone! Where is he?

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.730
Everyone, return!

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.060
What's wrong?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.150
You're running out of clones.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.650
My attacks are too fast for you to get close.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:17.160
Should I leave an opening for
him to come in and attack?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.150
Carefully...

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.680
Act natural.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.850
Here you go...

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.670
Come on!

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.190
He's a fake?

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.650
Wait...

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.450
You finally figured it out, idiot?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.570
There never was a real one.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.960
I'll kill you!

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.720
There<i> is</i> a real one, right here!

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.760
No kidding!

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.610
An aura explosion?

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.940
From Youpi?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.760
Did he really need to use such an ability?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.740
I'm worried...

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.070
But locating the King is my first priority!

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.440
You saved me, boss!

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.750
If you hadn't set that restriction,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.160
I would have snapped and rushed him!

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.650
Listen to me...

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.810
I will create only angry clones of you

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.820
when you've lost control of your temper.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.510
If that happens, you are to join the clones,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.560
and give careful thought to what must be done.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.320
I got it.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.530
After cooling down and thinking about it,

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.770
I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.720
But if Shoot couldn't move on his own,
who would have moved him?

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.710
Damn... Stop thinking about it!

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.300
I need to focus on the opponent before me!

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.020
Where...

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.210
am I?

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.770
That's...

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.080
Uh-oh!

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.120
Hurry up!

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.960
Go in before the entrance is blocked!

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.710
Damn, Bizeff is my prey!

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.210
If I knew what powers they had,
I could make a move.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.740
Don't come any closer...

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.990
Pouf!

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.310
Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.170
I'm Gon.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.720
And that's all there is to it.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.450
I'm Killua!

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.830
And that's all there is to it.
