WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The King's self-injury...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
The third party...

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.730
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.870
I have a feeling...

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.730
At worst, the answer we find could
potentially ruin all of our plans.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.120
It's time!

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.790
One minute to go.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.250
Gather around.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.690
Damn! We're out of time...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.040
Charge x And x Invade

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.740
Two minutes before Morel
issued the call to attack...

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.120
Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.680
the Republic of East Gorteau.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860
Pitou was the first one to notice.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.500
The only reason Pitou decided to look up

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.680
was "just because."

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.960
Pitou's hunch was just that faint.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.100
Something is coming.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.680
However, a few seconds later,
that hunch turned to certainty.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.250
The enemy.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.480
But at that point, the enemy was still very high up.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.770
Too high for even Pitou's
exceptional senses to ascertain.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.070
Pitou's decision to prepare for battle

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.780
was based solely on primal instinct.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240
Pitou's <i>En</i>...

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.050
has vanished.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.010
Two of the Royal Guard almost
simultaneously spotted the approaching form.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.570
A dragon!

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.820
At the Same Time

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.090
Ten seconds to go.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.320
Nine!

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.510
Eight!

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.320
Seven.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.160
As Morel counted down to the attack,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.540
Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.610
to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.800
Six...

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.410
Five.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.830
Four.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.430
Three.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.380
Two.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.050
This was when Pitou ceased using <i>En</i>,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.880
in order to prepare for the coming fight.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.700
However...

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.780
One.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.910
Go!

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.470
Your Majesty!

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.970
Dragon Meteor Shower
Dragon Dive

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.300
Dragon Dive.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.570
The sighting of the enemy

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.230
and the decision to stop using <i>En</i>
in preparation for battle had backfired.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480
Where are they?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.980
Faced with a serious threat to the King,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.040
Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits,

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.750
immediately focused on the intruders.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.330
The countless dragons that rained
down were less significant threats

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.430
than the humans in the sky.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.270
Terpsichora!

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.260
Puppet Master's Serenity
Terpsichora

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.270
Pitou uses this <i>Nen</i> ability when
full power is required to fight.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.030
It takes less than a tenth of a second
after activation to launch the attack.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.280
However, during that fraction of a second,
Pitou could hear Netero speaking.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.290
I prepared for a variety of responses.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.270
But you've made a bad move, little Ant.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.620
Bad Move

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.250
It really happens.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.870
You don't think it's possible.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.690
But it is.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.720
It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.700
When you know you're about to die, you feel
as though time slows, and you review your life.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.200
It's just like that.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.030
In fact, I'd consider this
phenomenon even more credible.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:44.460
Because you can hear what
the other person is thinking.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.500
You can even obtain information
known only to the other person.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.640
There is proof that it worked.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.230
Martial artists call this "listening with the spirit."

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.480
Listening with the Spirit

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.070
It's a time perception paradox that occurs
commonly when two skilled warriors clash.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.200
The secret behind the old man's strength?

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.440
I can think of a few possibilities.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.120
<i>First, his</i> Nen <i>is very quiet.</i>

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.710
No one can predict his next
attack by reading his aura.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.980
He's lived a long time for a reason.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.010
He has a plant's mental toughness.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.980
Hell, he was an old man when
I was still breast feeding.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.110
He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.550
I'd consider him an acquaintance.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.430
We are like yin and yang.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.100
Fool, we aren't evenly matched.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.740
He always has the upper hand.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.870
What?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.530
The secret behind his strength?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.350
I guess there's also that...

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.380
When it comes to battle,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.230
he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.740
That is his most dangerous ability.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:40.800
Netero's sequential movements appeared
exceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.410
No

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.410
No...

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.810
There was no doubt that
Netero's motions had ended

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.270
in the moment between Pitou's <i>Nen</i>
activation and subsequent attack.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.650
Essentially, this required the
constriction of time perception,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.760
almost to the point of stopping
time entirely for Pitou alone,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.100
in order to perceive Netero's actions.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.090
In other words, the result was...

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.560
an attack that could not be dodged.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.610
Netero, forty-six years old,
in the dead of winter.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.070
Sensing that he had reached his limits
of both body and technique,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.760
he spent much time in contemplation

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.130
before he reached an answer.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.540
Gratitude

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.910
That answer was gratitude.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.230
Amen...

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:04.280
He owed a debt to the martial arts
that had helped him to mature.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.730
The method he came up with to
repay that debt as best he could...

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.860
was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.790
He would calm himself,

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.700
worship,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.990
pray,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.920
ready himself,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.150
then punch.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.510
At first, completing the sequence
took five or six seconds.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:56.790
On the first day, he required over 18
hours to complete 10,000 punches.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.130
Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.300
When he awoke, he resumed
punching, day after day.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.210
After two years, he noticed a difference.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.000
After he'd completed 10,000 punches,
the sun was still up.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.680
At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.000
He managed to complete 10,000
punches of gratitude

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.190
in under an hour.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.090
This left him more time for prayer.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.880
When Netero came down from
the mountains, his fists

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.970
were faster than sound.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.510
Was that my imagination?

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.270
For a moment, he seemed to disappear...

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.750
I didn't hear anything until after...

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.430
Master?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.780
La—

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.960
Lady Guanyin...

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.490
So...

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.540
Are you willing to defend your school?

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.490
I offer you my school.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:55.130
Please accept me as a student!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.590
A monster was born.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.240
Sure, if you give me something to eat.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.770
This happened over six decades ago.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.700
Considering where his hands stopped,
the attack shouldn't come from there...

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.540
How?!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.540
I hope that you will not return.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.050
This will force me a long distance away!

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.300
Your Majesty!

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.650
Pouf!

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.800
He can't hear me...
He's too worried about the King.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.910
Doctor Blythe!

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.820
By its nature, this ability could
only be used for healing.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.010
Doctor Blythe cannot move from
its initial summoned position.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.810
Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.950
Pitou must stay within twenty meters.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.480
That restriction

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.220
kept Pitou in the fight.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.450
I've stopped?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.480
Quickly...

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.980
Quickly!

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.010
Midnight

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:53.640
There, they encountered someone they
hadn't counted on seeing at this point.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.540
It was Youpi.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.110
Next time: Monster x And x Monster.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.060
Roar! I'm gonna eat you!

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.990
Go ahead and try!

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.670
Chomp.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.050
Ow! Payback time!

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:29.650
Chomp chomp!

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.070
Chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp!

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.140
Chomp chomp!
