WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.480
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.530
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.390
He was probably trying to tell me this:

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.670
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.650
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.510
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.630
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.970
My best friend in the world!

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.270
Accompany on!

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.020
Nigg!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.020
Reunion x And x Understanding

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.660
Is that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.810
Gon's...

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.570
G-Ging...

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.770
I got a slot machine in my mouth!

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.510
It goes from 1 to 9.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.940
Each number summons a different weapon.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.930
This is my

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.540
Crazy Slots!

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.670
Crazy Slots:
Psychotic Clown

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.840
Give me something good...

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.680
4!

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.440
Damn, bad roll.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.310
Shut up!

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.320
You should be grateful, you idiot!

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.000
An ant?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.530
Are you hurt?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.500
Is that Ging?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.660
That isn't Ging...

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.880
Hey...

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.320
What was that about?

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.270
First you push us down, then you fire at us!

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.940
Enough fooling around!

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.570
Fooling around?

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.010
I was being dead serious.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.440
If I hadn't opened fire,
you would have been attacked.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.660
By what?!

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.970
The ant you shot?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.360
Ow!

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.390
What is this?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.890
Idiot!

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.020
That's no ordinary ant.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.440
It's a Chimera Ant.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.840
A Chimera Ant?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.680
An aggressive, carnivorous insect,
currently under class-1 quarantine.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.720
From time to time, they even attack humans.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.110
You were standing right in front of their nest.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.420
Had I not fired,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.250
a Chimera Ant army would
have consumed you by now.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.910
I feel like this has happened before...

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.840
Don't worry, it's not serious.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.070
Apply this.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.240
It's an antibiotic.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.350
What? That's it?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.610
Let's go nuts, man!

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.910
Shut up... Go away.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.420
You should leave, as well.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.350
Damn...

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.080
Because of this interruption,
I'll need to start over.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.510
But the nest was destroyed.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.390
Man, forced to take another life...

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.520
Ah!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.260
Man, forced to take another life...

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.830
Are you...

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.580
Are you the one

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.040
who saved me back then?

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.860
Back then?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.690
On Whale Island, after I stumbled into
the territory of a Foxbear with its cub.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.090
Whale Island?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.770
That time, too,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.810
you had to kill, in order to protect me.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.450
Oh, yes. I remember now.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.660
I never expected to run into you again here.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.330
You've grown, Gon.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.460
How do you know my name?

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.520
I heard it from your dad,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.670
Ging-san.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.880
Old man, you know Ging?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.860
Old...

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.250
Yeah, my name is Kite.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.840
Ging-san was my master.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.080
Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.280
Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.770
Call me Kite.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.300
It's awkward being addressed
formally by my master's son.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.670
Okay.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.360
Then, you're one too, Kite?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.990
Yeah, Ging-san was the one who
made me a top-class Hunter.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.230
He was my teacher and benefactor.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.470
If I hadn't met Ging-san,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.050
I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.120
Wait up!

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.660
Damned brat!

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.790
He swiped the bread that
I'd managed to find...

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.040
He isn't escaping today.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.480
My bread!

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.450
Bastard,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.950
you won't get away today!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.420
Ow!

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.830
What is this?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.990
What are you doing?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.120
Stop it...

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.700
You live with these guys?

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.650
That sounds fun.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.120
That was how you met Ging?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920
Yeah...

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.670
Ging-san said that good Hunters
are well-liked by animals.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.890
He said I had potential, so I got interested.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.880
And you became his student?

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.780
I had to force him to teach me.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.420
He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.500
So I was never his student officially.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.190
But I was a stubborn one...

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.520
I kept bugging him.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.570
Eventually, I started to develop my <i>Nen</i>,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.570
and he began teaching me to hunt.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.580
As a result, I was able to pass the
Hunter Exam with little difficulty.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.210
But before Ging-san was satisfied,
I had to clear another hurdle.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.960
Can you guess what it was?

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.470
I think I might know.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.750
Oh?

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.220
No, I definitely know.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.340
This is what Ging would have said...

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.980
"Try to catch me."

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.560
Exactly. You're right.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.360
I knew it! I figured that was it!

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.740
But as far as I knew, he was
the world's greatest Hunter.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.520
It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.960
There were no clues or leads to begin from.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.750
And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.880
He'd managed to completely erase
his existence from this world.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.110
<i>Like a super-powered form of</i> Zetsu?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.760
So...

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.510
So what happened in the end?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.990
I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.020
so I went to his home.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.400
To Whale Island.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.610
That was when I met you, Gon.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.590
But back then, I didn't realize

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.850
that you were Ging-san's son.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.190
I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.250
and told him about what had
happened on Whale Island.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.780
That was my kid... His name is Gon.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.090
Thanks for hitting him.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.600
It's common sense to avoid

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.990
Foxbear territory when they're raising young.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.390
Ging-san wasn't surprised

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.830
that I went to Whale Island,
or that I met you there.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.300
It was almost as though he'd expected it.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.580
Looking back,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.100
it may be that everything's gone
according to Ging-san's plans.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.150
Are you saying he set all this up?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.550
Well, I can't prove it.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.140
You might be right.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.040
Razor was waiting for me.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.260
And Dwun and List.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.790
Razor? Dwun?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.530
Yeah, in a game called <i>Greed Island</i>...

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.420
It's a long story.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.000
In the game, a guy named Razor was
waiting for me, at Ging's request.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.480
My son will come here one day.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.040
When that happens, give him a good beating.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.520
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.260
Don't get too cocky.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.690
He is my son.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.160
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.820
Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.130
who helped him create <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.470
Oh, Razor was also one of them...

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.420
Anyway, those three were waiting for me.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.780
When I learned that, I realized something.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:36.530
If Ging planned for me to go to <i>Greed
Island</i> and meet his friends,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:43.190
meeting Bisky and the others may have
been another part of his plan.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.800
In that case,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.640
it's possible that Ging also planned
that you'd meet Kite here.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.470
Huh?

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.860
Oh, that's right!

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.000
You must have been to <i>Greed Island</i> before.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.990
Me?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.010
Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"?

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.010
Nigg?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.670
No, I don't recall that name.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.070
Wait...

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.830
I do remember Ging-san taking
me inside a game...

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.270
I knew it!

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.130
<i>Greed Island</i>...

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.400
Yes, I believe that was its title.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.460
But I can't remember if I used an alias.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.230
That must be it...

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.100
Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.250
Damn! He tricked me!

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.470
You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.730
Are you sure this was the right decision,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.880
Ging?

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.410
Can you make it so that using
Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.330
while using Accompany will send him to Kite?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.220
I can...

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.950
Why do you want me to do that?

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.500
If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on
his own, I'm willing to meet with him.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.660
But I can't meet him if he's so gutless
that he has to bring friends.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.280
Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.560
I don't understand.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.930
Never mind... Just do it!

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.470
You'd probably just be
embarrassed if he brought a crowd.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.220
Shut up! Just do it!

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.400
He's so weird...

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.230
Shy and stubborn.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.440
I feel sorry for Gon-kun.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.490
I understand.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.580
So the game <i>Greed Island</i> was
created to train you boys.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.790
Only Gon, really.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.500
I just tagged along for the ride.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.880
That may have been part of Ging's plan, too.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.850
Even me?

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.330
Nah, that's impossible.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.260
However,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.170
it appears that our meeting
here wasn't coincidence.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.600
Yeah, I agree.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.890
There must be a deeper meaning to this.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.320
Meaning?

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.720
Razor waited inside the
game to make you stronger,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.520
so one would think Ging must
have some role for Kite to play.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.530
A role...

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.730
Your final test was finding Ging, right?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.200
Yeah.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.280
That sounds like a daunting task.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.990
The best Hunters in this world

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.790
are masters of not only hunting,
but concealing themselves as well.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.050
Yet you were able to find him.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.120
Oh...

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.420
Yeah, that's true.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.950
Once you cleared your final test,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.680
Ging must have decided you were
worthy of handling this.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.900
Handling this? Handling what?

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.670
Handling what? Basically...

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.820
Thanks for hitting him.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.220
Say, Gon...

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.470
Want me to tell you Ging-san's
current whereabouts?

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.090
No, I'll find him on my own.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.340
A good response.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.760
Anyway, tell me about Ging.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.520
Tell me everything you know!

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.550
How to help two-headed wolves breed?

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.740
Ging is involved in that stuff?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.750
Sure, Ging-san is involved with a
wide range of Hunter activities.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.160
He's never formally applied
because he doesn't want

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.060
to expend the energy, but he's as
qualified as a Triple Star Hunter.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.810
Triple Star?

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.060
Stars are awarded to Hunters who
perform extraordinary tasks.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.500
Those responsible for

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.260
historical discoveries or global
achievements receive three stars.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.710
There are fewer than ten of
these Hunters in the world.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.460
The title "Triple Star Hunter"
is reserved for the very best.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.600
So Ging is as good as the best!

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.760
Kite...

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.100
A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.350
Ging-san is also famous

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.800
for discovering the Lurka Ruins
and the Kongo gold vein.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.990
Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.430
Kite, student of Ging...

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.400
While his meeting

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.860
with Gon and Killua signaled the
beginning of a new adventure...

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.790
On the Yorbian continent, in the
southernmost of the Balsa Islands,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.750
a prologue to unparalleled fear

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.430
was quietly but steadily unfolding.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.530
Not enough.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.770
These creatures are not enough,
no matter how many I eat.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.810
But I cannot move...

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.940
Stay calm.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.900
Focus on recovering my energy.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.620
I must heal before I can take the next step.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.000
I have a duty to fulfill...

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.500
I must give birth to the King!

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.290
I am the Queen!

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.460
Next time: Unease x And x Sighting.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.510
Are you uneasy, Killua?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.420
D-Don't embarrass me!
