00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.760
How wonderful...

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.020
I really do love that look.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.060
But I was pretty excited, as well.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.550
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.320
But I couldn't.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.040
And at the same time, I was excited.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.320
Isn't that strange?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.330
A x Surprising x Challenge

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.340
Looks like we made it in time.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.970
Leorio...

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.710
Leorio!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.490
Man, that stings...

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.570
Why am I all beat up?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.660
Huh?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.590
My memory is kinda hazy.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.640
We probably shouldn't tell
him what happened.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.700
Yeah...

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.330
Gon.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.840
Killua!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.020
I can't believe you actually got here...

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.830
I thought you were done for.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.260
I just tracked Leorio's cologne.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.320
Cologne?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.770
That was how?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.970
You definitely are weird.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.600
Excellent work, everyone.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.100
Phase Two of the exam will occur here,
in the Biska Forest Park.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.710
So, I shall take my leave.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.360
Best of luck to all of you.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.700
Will all applicants who passed
the First Phase please enter?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.900
Welcome.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900
I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.640
And I'm Buhara, the other examiner.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.900
Wh-What was that sound?

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.500
You must be hungry.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.650
I'm starving...

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.650
There you have it.
Phase Two will involve...

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.160
...cooking!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.280
C-Cooking?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.540
Wait! Cooking?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.900
We're here to take the Hunter Exam!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.930
That's quite right.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.710
Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce
a dish that will satisfy our palate.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.480
Why do we have to cook?!

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.480
That's because

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.560
we are Gourmet Hunters.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.190
Huh?

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.140
Man, what a letdown.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.940
They're Gourmet Hunters...

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.950
<i>The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...</i>

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.780
<i>Their selection as examiners
could prove problematic.</i>

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.140
<i>Only fifty applicants...</i>

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.130
<i>No, depending on the task,</i>

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.790
<i>it's possible that fewer than ten
applicants will pass Phase Two.</i>

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.800
So, Gourmet Hunters,
what are we supposed to make?

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.430
Buhara.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.180
The required ingredient is pork.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.540
Pork?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.590
As in pig meat?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.660
You're free to use meat from any
species of Biska Forest pigs.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.450
You must use the cooking facilities here
to prepare the pork.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.940
And you only pass if we both
find it delicious.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.530
And we will evaluate more
than just the taste.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.560
Don't underestimate the
intricacies of cooking.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.580
Got it?

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.790
When we've both eaten our fill,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.620
the exam will end.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.310
We get it. We get it.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.840
Let's just start.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.920
Then, the exam's Second Phase

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.850
begins now!

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.080
Free to use meat from any species of pigs?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.390
You have a real nasty streak.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.110
Choosing the ingredients was my job.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.860
Only one species of pig lives in
the Biska Forest, correct?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.620
I hope they don't get themselves killed.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.580
Hey, little piggy?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.850
Catch a pig and cook it.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.010
This is way easier than the First Phase.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.220
I hope it will be that simple...

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.240
What was that about, Gon?!

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.340
Found them.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.260
Huh?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.280
Pigs!

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.000
Uh... They're chewing on bones.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.320
Don't tell me...

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.400
They're carnivores?

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.880
Huh?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.840
What's that?

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.850
These pigs are crazy!

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.100
The Great Stamp,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.360
the world's most ferocious pig.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.010
They use their large, stout noses
to send their enemies flying.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.240
If you're too slow, you'll end up
as their dinner.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.660
Take that!

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.080
What?

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.120
Huh?

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.280
Just maybe...

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.270
Could their foreheads be
their weak points?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.050
So, the pigs evolved large,

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.300
strong noses in order to protect
their soft foreheads.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.320
Oh, my. They caught a lot.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.050
<i>This year's applicants are very talented.</i>

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.630
<i>However, the difficult part is yet to come.</i>

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.640
Now eat the pig and send me
to the next phase.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.890
Okay, it's evaluation time.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.640
Taste testing.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.650
Tastes good!

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.920
It's overcooked.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.910
The tough texture ruins the
flavor of the meat.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.570
What? You haven't even tried it!

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.180
It's plain as day.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.540
Damn it...

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.290
Okay... Dive in!

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.170
Huh? Why?

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.380
Charred on the outside,
uncooked inside.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.930
Your fire was too strong.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.540
<i>Honestly...</i>

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.900
<i>All they're doing is roasting the whole pig,
like it's all they know how to do...</i>

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.820
<i>None of them has made any effort!</i>

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.450
No one's passed yet...

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.450
And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.210
Hey!

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.960
Can't anyone out there satisfy me?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.350
That's it!

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.410
This phase of the exam is a cooking test,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.920
but they're judging us on originality
and powers of observation.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.380
I see...

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.390
How do you like my cooking?

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.800
Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.390
I'm next!

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.060
It's basically the same thing!

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.650
I am next!

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.790
Please judge my creation.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.900
Finally, something that
resembles an actual dish...

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.410
<i>The point is to use the provided
facilities and ingredients</i>

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.060
<i>to highlight the main feature, the pork.</i>

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.540
<i>In other words, the taste is insignificant!</i>

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.440
Yuck!

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.050
Huh?

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.140
Appearance is important,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.980
but only if it also tastes good.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.770
You're no better than #403!

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.880
Too bad!

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.180
No better than #403...

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.380
That was so much food,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.390
I'm stuffed!

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.510
Yeah, I'm stuffed, too.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.820
Therefore, no one passes.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.210
We're finished here!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.280
It's over?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.400
What the hell?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.000
<i>As I expected, she's lapsed back
into her old bad habits.</i>

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.830
What should we do, Chairman?

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.390
I suppose I have no choice.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.090
Fine, I'll have to go in person.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:28.180
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.180
Menchi

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.440
Zero people passed?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.930
Are you serious?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.960
Does she really mean it?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.440
The exam is over?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.480
This isn't funny!

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.410
I won't accept it...

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.950
I absolutely refuse to accept this!

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.670
In the end, you've still failed.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.820
Stop screwing around!

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.570
You asked for pork,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.730
so we risked our lives to—

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.730
I said to prepare the pork in a manner

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.890
we both found delicious...

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.840
None of you made anything
remotely delicious.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.090
You all did almost the same thing.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.350
There was no effort made...

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.100
Just when I thought someone actually tried,
they only changed the appearance.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.600
No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.350
I'm positive that none of you
took cooking seriously!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.780
Pork dishes are all the same...

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.930
Just say that once more.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.680
Any more crap from you,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.820
and I'll shove my arm up your ass
and knock your teeth out!

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.900
Don't you mess with me!

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.160
<i>There's Menchi's bad habit again...</i>

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.670
I don't want any lip from a bunch of

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.610
<i>After all, only a handful of chefs</i>

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.270
amateurs who can't even roast a pig!

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.520
<i>in the entire world can satisfy Menchi.</i>

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.150
Hey! What did you just say?

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.670
Why don't you repeat it to my face?!

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.460
In other words, you people

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.680
don't have the guts to try anything new.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.120
Shut up!

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.900
I'm not trying to become
a cook or a gourmet...

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.990
I want to be a Hunter!

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.910
Yeah! Yeah!

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.370
My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.050
I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter
decide my fate!

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.060
Too bad you got stuck with a mere

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.690
Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.840
Better luck next year?

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.700
Why, you...

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.530
Don't mock me!

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.400
Buhara, don't interfere.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.780
Well...

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.380
If I hadn't intervened,
you'd have killed him, right?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.580
Probably.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.880
Let me clarify this...

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.070
We frequently venture into the dens

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.810
of ferocious beasts,
searching for ingredients.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.720
Every Hunter knows some form
of martial art.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.770
You lack focus and the willingness
to experiment.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.440
That alone disqualifies you
from becoming Hunters!

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.950
That said,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.710
it would be excessive to fail
every single applicant.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.800
That's the symbol of the
Hunters Association!

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.530
Is it someone from the
Selection Committee?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.740
Wh-Who's that geezer?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.440
The Chairman of the
Selection Committee.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.490
He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.640
Chairman Netero.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.410
Well, I work behind the scenes.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.790
I only take action when there's
an issue, like now.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.760
So, Menchi-kun...

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.010
Yes, sir.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.010
You failed all of the applicants because

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.770
you disapproved of their reluctance

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.440
to try new things?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:15:59.770
No, sir...

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.730
I lost my cool when one
of the candidates

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.410
insulted Gourmet Hunters.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.780
And I made the exam harder
than necessary.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.910
In other words, you're aware that
this exam was unacceptable.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.070
Yes, sir.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.170
When cooking is involved,
I lose control.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.270
I'm unqualified to be an examiner.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.840
I will resign as examiner,

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.920
so please redo the Second Phase!

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.400
But it would be difficult to find

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.600
another examiner on such short notice.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.430
I apologize...

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.310
Very well. How about this?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.930
I'd like you to continue serving
as an examiner.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.160
But you must also participate

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.820
in the new test you propose.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.190
Is that acceptable?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.620
I'm certain that will help

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.700
the applicants to accept the results.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.310
That's true...

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.640
Then the new challenge will be

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.460
boiled eggs!

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.290
Boiled eggs?

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.850
Chairman, can you take us
to Mt. Split-in-Half

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.730
in your airship?

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.420
Mt. Split-in-Half?

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.000
I see what you're doing.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.180
Certainly, I can.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.430
Now, everyone...

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.110
Look down there.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.230
Wh-What is that?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.380
A Spider Eagle's web.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.490
They build webs down there?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.490
Look below the web.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.250
Those are...

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.380
Those are Spider Eagle eggs.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.040
Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.590
to protect their eggs from predators.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.260
This makes their eggs

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.260
one of the most difficult
ingredients to obtain.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.100
The eggs are also known as dream eggs.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.860
W-Wait a minute...

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.770
You don't mean we...

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.350
I sure do.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.020
What?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.900
Even if she can grab some eggs,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.660
how will she climb back up?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.970
Hey... She jumped down!

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.670
Is she trying to kill herself?

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.220
No, she's not.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:42.730
Huh?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.890
That looks fun...

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.800
This ravine has updrafts

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.250
that help the hatched chicks
fly up to the web.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.750
There. Now I just need to boil the egg.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.930
Y-You must be joking.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.790
No reasonable person would
jump down there...

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.610
I've been waiting for this!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.890
Okay! Count me in!

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.020
Wait!

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.480
I haven't finished explaining everything!

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.610
Catch you later.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.250
Let's go!

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.820
Not yet.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.890
Why not?

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.990
There's no wind.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.910
There isn't always an updraft.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.310
When's the next one?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.260
Wait.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:00.800
What?

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.890
The web won't hold us all!

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.770
Gon, not yet?

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.390
Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.660
It's gonna snap!

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.160
Now!

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.310
And the rest of you?

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.130
I guess you quit.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.930
It takes courage to concede, too.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.280
This is damned good.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.520
Much better than the eggs
you buy in a store...

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.080
I can see why they're
called dream eggs.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.730
Hey, Todo-san.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.590
Would you like a bite?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.510
It's delicious...

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.970
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.730
how good something can taste.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.380
We're risking our lives for that joy.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.260
I was completely outclassed this year.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.610
I'll be back next year!

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.280
The applicants have learned that,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.330
whether you're a Black List Hunter
or a Gourmet Hunter,

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.060
calling yourself a Hunter requires an
enormous amount of determination.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.550
Only 42 applicants remain.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.850
Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.260
Use soap when you wash your hands!

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.420
R-Right!
