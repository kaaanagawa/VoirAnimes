WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
Lead all the soldiers here on a mission

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.720
to capture my food...

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.900
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.990
At once!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
Very x Rapid x Reproduction

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.700
Class-1 quarantined insects

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.880
Once they've evolved beyond
two meters in length,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.920
humans no longer stand a chance.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830
Hey, what's that?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.700
M-M-Monsters!

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.880
Listen carefully!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.010
Target the fully grown ones.
They will provide the most nutrition.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.950
Now go!

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.080
A Chimera Ant queen

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.030
moves repeatedly until she
finds a place she likes.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.450
As she does, she births more and more
soldier ants to build her own army.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.420
Once she's chosen a location,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.080
she births a large number of carpenter ants,
which construct her castle with incredible speed.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.510
From then on, the queen remains
within the castle until death.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.610
So if a Queen grew to two meters tall

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.020
and were to set her sights on humans,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.350
there should be entire villages
or towns of missing people.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.870
I don't see anything...

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.910
I just checked the past six months,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.460
and the largest group only numbered ten.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.840
Say, can we look up missing people individually?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.670
Don't be ridiculous.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.210
You know how many hundreds of thousands
of people go missing worldwide?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.320
We should be able to see which areas
have the highest concentrations.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.470
No good... The data's two years old.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.500
Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.810
If someone saw a two-meter insect,
they'd make a big fuss.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.600
We tried that, of course.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.480
But we couldn't find anything.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.360
Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.100
Yeah.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.660
Bring up the tidal data from
the day the arm was found.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.170
The arm was discovered here...

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.570
Now go back ten days.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.260
Locate any currents that may have carried
the arm to that location in that time.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.860
What do you mean?

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.700
It's possible that the arm

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.670
was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.850
That makes sense.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.020
It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.520
Including the Mitene Union.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.990
The Mitene Union...

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.280
Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.530
Yes, as well as East Gorteau.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.150
There's no getting information
out of those two countries.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.040
What's this NGL?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.420
An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.980
It's a country founded by people who wanted to
live in nature, away from machine civilization.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.550
Here.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:31.180
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.060
They primarily communicate by letter.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.080
Primary means of transportation is by horse.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.180
Anyone knowingly bringing technology into
the country is subject to execution.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.300
In '87,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.720
a three-man TV crew was caught trying
to enter the country to get a story.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.190
One was executed, and the
other two remain in prison.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.550
Of its 2.17 million population,
99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.530
with the rest being support volunteers.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.080
If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.760
how would the NGL citizenry react?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.410
They probably wouldn't do anything.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.670
When a deadly epidemic spread throughout
the area, they let nature run its course,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.720
refusing to admit international doctors.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.150
And even if they tried to contact the outside,
it would be too late by the time word arrived.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.750
If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.790
she may have already begun to build her nest.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.690
A contest?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.240
Yeah...

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.490
Between you and me.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.620
Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.130
I challenge you!

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.050
Hmph.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.040
What?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.240
You're running away?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.530
Hey, accept my challenge!

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.380
Accept?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.510
Are you issuing an order?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.390
Why should I follow an order from you?

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.390
I can only follow the Queen's orders.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.450
You're just scared of losing.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.490
My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.150
I can beat any squadron in this castle!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.020
Oh, I know...

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.190
I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.290
If we all compete, we'll capture more prey.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.010
More prey?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.530
I see...

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.470
I agree with that idea.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.300
If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.560
Okay, that settles it.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.900
However, I believe that the
prey's quality also matters.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.340
We must ensure that the Queen
eats highly nutritious humans.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.560
That guy's such a stiff...

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.810
That's what makes him endearing.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.250
He is dedicated and loyal.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.070
I presume the human he was created
from was also quite earnest.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.890
Hey, wait!

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.230
Weren't you supposed to get some rest?

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.780
I'll bring her back.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.740
Don't bother, it won't help.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.330
But she goes to the forest every morning,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.660
and she spends the whole day searching.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.490
Right, she'll probably collapse soon...

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.750
But she can't stop looking.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.810
That's what it means to be a parent.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.270
How many days has it been since
Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.920
It's like spirits whisked them away.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.040
Big bugs...

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.150
Huh?

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.280
We haven't raided this area yet.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.280
Mom!

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.250
It must be them...

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.950
Those monsters must have stolen your children!

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.970
Excellent.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.970
This should suffice to please the Queen.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.230
Wh-What's happening?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.730
Exterminate the insects quickly.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.740
That's Gyro's order.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.990
Gyro? What's that?

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.570
Our king's name!

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.700
Damn!

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.720
I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.990
But to reach NGL, we have to

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.710
take an airship to the neighboring
Republic of Rokario,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.230
and travel by land from there.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.690
It "ant" gonna be easy to get into
a country of such nasty rumors.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.480
Just kidding.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.490
Nasty rumors?

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.490
What do you mean?

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.870
Have you heard of D²?

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.240
D²?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.750
It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly
throughout urban areas worldwide.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.410
It's derived from the bila tree,
native to the Mitene Union.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.120
And they claim

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.510
that over 80% of the world's
bila trees are located in NGL.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.020
So the nasty rumors are saying that the
drug is being manufactured in NGL?

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.360
They're only rumors.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.350
No one has been able to publicly prove it.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.520
After all, the country's locked down tight.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.030
When people try to get in to
investigate, they're executed.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.730
Executed...

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.530
He wasn't executed?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.120
No, if he'd been captured trying
to uncover NGL's secrets,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.170
he'd have probably been executed
like that TV crewman.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.130
But this reporter was wearing a wire,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.160
from which we intercepted the final message.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.430
When the message was played...

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.720
M-Monsters...

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.410
Giant bugs!

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.440
Giant bugs?

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.150
What do you think?

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.680
That isn't enough information to be sure...

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.080
As a Magical Beast Hunter,
I'll have to see for myself.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.900
Then that settles it.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.140
I'll get three tickets.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.330
Make it four.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.460
Ponzu...

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.150
I'm coming with you.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.910
You can't.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.220
This is too dangerous,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.690
and you don't have a professional license yet.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.930
And we're talking about NGL...

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.470
That's why I should come.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.130
You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.000
If they discover you with cell phones
or wireless communicators,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.480
you'll be arrested right away.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.180
So if there's any trouble, you'll need me...

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.380
Or rather, you'll need them.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.120
They can carry a letter anywhere.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.500
I get it.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.180
They'll certainly come in handy.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.530
It may be a bit late to ask,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.890
but are you sure you want to come?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.020
Of course!

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.390
You weren't kidding about the "late" part.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.400
We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.560
There may very well be a swarm
of giant Chimera Ants already,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.830
hunting humans down.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.410
If that turns out to be the case,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.710
my priority will be saving them.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.420
So I may not be able to help you.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.060
You must be able to protect yourselves.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.210
If you want to come, that's the requirement.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.930
Okay, got it.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.920
We'll be fine.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.740
And if I'm the one who's in danger,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.180
you should escape without me.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.180
Got it?

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.490
A pretty good haul.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.100
But it's not even half the size of
what my squadron delivered...

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.780
My focus was quality.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.470
And I wasn't competing against you.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.920
Whatever.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.710
Anyway, did you hear?

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.600
That turtle guy ran into human resistance.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.600
Resistance?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.600
Hmm,

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.480
those were probably guns.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.900
Guns?

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.750
Put simply, it's a barrel that launches
metal projectiles called bullets

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.860
using the explosive force of gunpowder.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.610
It's one of the most commonly
used human weapons.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.620
No idea what you're talking about...

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.410
If you want the details, read books.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.700
Books are wonderful.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.990
You can learn about how these
human creatures think,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.380
behave, and function as a society.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.070
Can you answer my question, then?

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.780
Do humans have armies too?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.970
Armies?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.470
Yes, that was an army.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.810
They belong to a military body
led by an authoritative figure,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.570
much like ourselves!

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.780
Ah, I have another question.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.800
They mentioned something about a name.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.060
A name?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.780
I can't blame you for not understanding.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.290
Because it's a human idea
we do not make use of.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.440
Put simply...

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.450
So it seems there are humans

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.550
capable of more than running and crying.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.280
I don't know why that should surprise you.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.060
Given how different you and I are,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.650
it's only natural that individual humans
would have unique traits as well.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.980
After all, their blood flows through us.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.240
Assemble, squadron leaders!

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.270
Assemble, squadron leaders!

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.500
The Queen summons us.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.120
Assemble, squadron leaders!

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.980
Do you get a headache when
the Queen calls to us?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.200
Yeah, my ears start ringing.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.850
It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.380
I shall now begin preparations
for the King's birth.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.410
Every day, provide me with fifty humans.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.580
Yes, Majesty!

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.980
Your Majesty, may I ask a question?

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.420
Permitted. Speak.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.670
Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.550
with weapons to use against us.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.020
We must fortify our defenses,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.470
in preparation for any potential attack.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.420
I have a few ideas...
Would you care to hear them?

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.190
I shall let you decide your course.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.740
I must focus entirely on my son.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.570
Yes, and one more thing...

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.080
Would you allow us to have names?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.080
What is a name?

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:27.250
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.090
Very well, do as you like.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.780
I am truly grateful!

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.310
How peculiar.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.990
They speak their minds and
request to use these names.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.140
While bettering the race, they compete for glory,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.810
leading to a stronger sense of individuality.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.740
I suppose I am also peculiar to
find this change fascinating.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:06.120
Perhaps I, too, have traces
of human blood within me.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.380
Regardless, I feel quite confident now.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:20.390
I can see you already, as though
recalling a memory from my past.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.570
My King...

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.650
You shall stand atop this world!

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.410
Names... Quite amusing.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.480
The King's three Royal Guards.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.240
I shall name you myself.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.170
What did you just decide?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.090
Remember what Kite said before we left?

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.010
That we should escape without
him if he's in danger.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.490
Yeah, I don't think it was a choice...

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.310
Yeah.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.510
That's why neither of us said anything,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.860
but I've been thinking.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.650
Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.150
to be in that much danger?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.360
You said that Ging had a reason for
bringing Kite and me together...

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.250
Yeah.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.460
You're probably right.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.810
I don't know the reason,

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.250
but I can't give up halfway,
no matter what's going on.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.470
Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.700
Of course, I could never forgive myself, either.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.640
So I won't run away.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.150
That's what I've decided.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.730
Man,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.270
you had this totally serious expression,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.670
so I was expecting something big.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.520
But it's just business as usual.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.960
Huh? I thought about this a lot.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.780
I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.310
Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.750
If someone said you should abandon them,

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.640
you'd never do it.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.170
You make it sound like I wasted
my time considering it.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.600
Then what about you?

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.760
I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think
about it when the time comes.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.850
You mean you might run away?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.600
Depends.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.770
I can't say until it actually happens.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.360
Say for instance...

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.600
I can't tell you what I'd do in
a hypothetical situation.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.820
I don't decide until it's time.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:46.530
The airship carrying the group
heads for the Mitene Union,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:53.120
still unaware of the cruel fate
that lies in wait for them...

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.800
Next time: No x Good x NGL.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.550
Ready, start!

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.760
Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur...

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.010
And there's your outtake!
