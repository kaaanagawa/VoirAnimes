00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.980
Homecoming x And x True Name

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.920
With the death of King Meruem,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.990
the battle between Chimera Ants
and humans was over.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:45.240
Republic of Rokario
NGL Autonomous Region

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:45.240
Hass Republic

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:45.240
Republic of East Gorteau    Republic of West Gorteau

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.220
The Republic of East Gorteau and
the NGL were tentatively placed

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.030
under control of international peacekeepers,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.350
and the nations essentially ceased to exist.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.050
Between the two former nations,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.600
five million survivors were declared refugees.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.710
The Mitene Union's three remaining members

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.740
divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.830
to jointly govern the former nation's territory.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.950
As for the NGL,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.960
there was a proposal to give all open land

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.670
permanent designation as nature reserves,
to prevent future incidents.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.780
And the international community concurred.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.730
It was agreed that the nature reserves would be

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.160
under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.680
Are you sure about this?

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.930
Yeah, I'm gonna live here.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.940
The name "Gyro" doesn't mean anything to me.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.760
But this place feels very familiar.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.530
I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident
that didn't work for Gyro...

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.460
Well, I won't force you to come, then.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.490
This is probably safer than other countries now.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.270
Exactly.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.710
One look at me, and the peacekeepers
would freeze on the spot.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.050
Is that

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.760
why she's staying?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.580
No, in her case...

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.610
She seems more like you guys.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.100
What do you mean?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500
Hey! Aren't you done?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.840
We'll leave you behind!

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.480
Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.880
Well, people like me who barely
remember our previous lives

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.380
can tell that people like you and Hina,
who have their memories, are different.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.260
There's something in your eyes.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.010
Or it's how you look into the distance.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.640
Somehow, I can tell at once.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.250
"This guy remembers his past."

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.020
And I can tell that

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.040
she remembers her past.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.300
Hina said she'll never talk to us...

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.140
But I don't think it's that she won't talk.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.720
It's that she can't talk.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.880
She's probably just a kid.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.050
Welfin!

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.020
Zip it! I get the idea!

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.800
See ya.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.270
We probably won't see each
other again, so take care.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.340
Yeah.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.360
Try not to die until you're dead.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.820
The hell is that?

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.980
Gyro's way of saying goodbye.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.200
It's one of my favorite phrases.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.370
Did you just remember something?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.600
No... I just kinda like the phrase.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.790
Oh.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.260
So life is what you make of it, huh?

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.080
Later.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.480
Yeah.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.490
Well, let's get going.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.620
Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.510
Seriously, you have no shame.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.770
Not so long ago, it was
"Hagya-sama" this, "Leol-sama" that.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.770
Who's that?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.030
Huh?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.520
No point in thinking about the dead.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.360
I have to move forward!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.330
Straight ahead!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.110
Still... Are you sure we can
make it through the port?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.180
Yeah, this is a government vehicle,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.790
so once I show my card, they'll let us pass.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.760
Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City...

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.020
How far I've fallen.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.870
Don't be so negative about it.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.970
Just be patient.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.410
I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.190
It's possible that

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.500
he's already gathered all the sympathizers

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.440
and tools we'll need to build our own nation.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.080
Which means...

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.330
In no time, we'll be back on top!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.580
Yay!

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.770
You're so optimistic, I can only envy you.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.870
Optimistic?

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.820
You've got that right.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.940
I've already died twice...

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.220
But I'm still alive!

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.760
Nothing scares me now.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.230
I'm ready for anything!

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.400
Plus,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.610
I'm the one who stopped the King.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.360
H-Hey...

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.960
Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.000
Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.850
Yeah, that's the spirit.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.870
Humans are alive until they're dead!

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.030
What? You're stating the obvious!

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.250
Quiet!

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.940
Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to
Meteor City, in search of Gyro.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.190
Is that the village?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.240
Hey...

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.670
Don't worry.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.710
I'm with you.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.540
Monsters!

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, that's to be expected.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.530
Hey!

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.950
People of NGL!

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.180
I need someone who can communicate

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.580
in a peaceful and reasonable manner!

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.700
I'm not here to harm anyone!

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.700
I just have a question to ask!

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.710
Hey! You can speak?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.710
Who are you?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.470
Uh...

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.720
This will probably be hard to believe,
but will you hear me out?

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.110
You're the only people I can turn to!

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.750
Reina?

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.430
How did...

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.760
you know?

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.330
Reina...

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.750
Reina...

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.620
Reina!

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.750
How did you know?

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.060
Of course I knew...

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.830
I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.610
Welcome home.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.690
I'm so glad you're back.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.150
Brother tried to protect me!

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.660
He told the monster to go away,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.520
and told me to run... He kept me safe!

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.000
But I was too scared to move!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.600
I'm sorry!

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.980
It's okay... I'm sorry.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.330
You and Kurt did your best.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.740
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.710
I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.420
Welcome home, Reina-chan.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.850
You must be hungry.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.520
Let's eat together.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.830
Hey...

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.490
Why don't you join us?

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.730
No... I'll pass.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.610
Don't say that.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.100
You saved Reina-chan.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.310
Please let us feed you.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.010
That isn't what I was doing...

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.850
See ya.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.610
Damn...

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.760
I've returned the favor, okay?

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.370
Damn that stupid octopus!

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.250
He never should've let me live!

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.000
Thank you...

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.650
Let's eat.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.130
Let's eat

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.950
together.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.770
Huh?

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.350
What's going on?

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.930
What... What's wrong?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.300
Reina and Brovada return home.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.800
Hello? Is this Colt?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.690
It's me.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.700
The politicians have turned this
into an international crisis.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.200
The Ants are no longer involved.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.490
No longer involved?

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.960
Is that actually possible?

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.720
That's what politicians do.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.730
You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.170
Magical Beast...

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.900
Well, if they label you as a good
Magical Beast, you'll be fine.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.100
Any changes on your side?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.750
Actually, something has been bothering me.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.920
Something bothering you?

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.180
Yeah, it's Reina.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.540
No! You're wrong!

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.240
She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.280
What is it, then?

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.120
I'm not Reina!

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.870
My name

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.380
is Kite!

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.600
Gon!

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.010
Killua!

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.820
Doctor...

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.030
How's Gon?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.910
He's still in critical condition.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.950
I wouldn't recommend sending
him to a specialist

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.920
until he can be taken off life support.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.220
I've never seen or heard of anything like this.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.480
How could this happen overnight
to a twelve-year-old boy?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.800
I understand.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.310
We'll bring the specialist here.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.940
He's a hero who's earned special treatment.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.550
I will cover all the expenses.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.940
If necessary, we may have to
rebuild this entire hospital.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.950
In any case,

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.230
we cannot let Gon die.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.630
In the end,

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.330
you did everything by yourself...

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.730
I want that one myself!

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.820
I get it.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.640
Kite saved your life, and he
has no connection to me.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.570
But... Still...

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.220
I wanted you to ask for my
help in defeating Pitou!

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.930
Let's go.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.540
Did you say that to me as a teammate?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.480
Or as a friend?

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.180
I know...

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.490
This is just a tantrum.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.950
It's the same as always.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.950
You run ahead,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.950
while I clean up after you.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.670
The same as always...

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.340
I'll clean up your mess!

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.510
But this time, I won't let it slide.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.590
You have to apologize.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.250
I'm going to

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.820
heal you up!

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.520
So you have to apologize!

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.230
Killua...

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.120
We're assembling a team of
medical specialists to save Gon.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.780
I must head back, so I can use
Hide and Seek to transport

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.600
equipment and people.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.650
Will you come with me?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.390
No, I won't.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.330
That's true...

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.590
It's important to stay with Gon
and talk to him, as well.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.020
I'm going to save Gon.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.610
You go get those doctors.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.650
They'll still be needed...

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.040
While I'm gone.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.960
Killua?

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.340
I'm the one who'll save Gon!

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.270
Uh, I am Netero...

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.730
I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.420
The next chairman will be selected by election.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.510
I am setting the condition that
all Hunters must vote.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.520
If voter turnout is under 95%,
the results will be invalid.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.030
I ask that the Zodiacs handle the details,
such as schedule and polling method.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.880
I'd say the difficulty for this mission is D-rank.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.580
I'm counting on you all.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.390
Take care.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.110
In response to Netero's message,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.820
the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders,
assembled at headquarters that day.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.080
Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.040
I won't say anything until I've seen your face.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.590
I'm going to heal you up,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.100
so you have to apologize!
