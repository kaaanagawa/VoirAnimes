WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If you lose,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.480
I shall take your left arm.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.230
Well... Instead of my left arm...

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.990
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.400
What?

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.490
What do you bet?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.500
My life.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.130
Your life, was it?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.000
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.980
Accept this apology.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.240
So this is it?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.510
Our golden opportunity?

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.360
Yes...

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Knov x And x Morel

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.300
Neferpitou has stopped

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.090
using <i>En</i>, in order to heal the King's injury.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.840
Knov takes this opportunity
to infiltrate the palace.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.750
Finally, I've gotten this close.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.010
Still more than one hundred meters
to the central stairway.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.780
These strange trees bear very large fruit.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.160
Around five hundred per tree...

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.910
And there are ten trees.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.290
A total of five thousand.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.760
Five hundred thousand people were to undergo

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.290
the selection process each day,
with a one-percent survival rate.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.550
But thanks to Killua's distractions,
that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.700
so the numbers add up...

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.560
These are cocoons holding the
humans who were selected.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.160
<i>Which means they will become </i>Nen<i>-wielding
human weapons at the King's disposal,</i>

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.060
turning against the rest of humanity.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.090
Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.080
and intends to manipulate these
soldiers per the King's will,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.460
expanding his conquest throughout the world.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.830
I will not let that happen!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.830
First, the far exit... is set.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.840
Next...

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.340
I must get closer.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.840
The palace entrance looks dark...

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.220
So far, so good...

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.840
Middle exit... set.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.300
Now for the near exit.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.370
There aren't any guards...

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.870
I'd imagine only a select few are inside.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.770
This will work.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.540
If I've come this far,
I can reach the inner palace.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.780
The throne room is on the third
floor, at the rear and center.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.200
King

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.560
We must delay any reinforcements,
even if by only a second.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.160
Central Stairway

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.700
The first floor is too far for that.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.270
The central stairway, second floor.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.640
That's the best location!

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.160
The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.220
To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.340
No, that would be no different
from the one outside...

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.380
It should at least

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.210
be next to the first floor's central stairway.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.570
Then, if I can, I'll go up from
there to the second floor...

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.100
Window Opener
Scream

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.100
Scream...

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.270
Close!

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.840
Are any others around?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.800
If I'm seen, it's over.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.720
I'll have to retreat...

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.590
Nothing's coming?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.970
Then it was alone?

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.630
This is it.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.510
I can't move beyond this point...

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.090
If I do, I'll be killed.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.150
What is that aura?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.270
It appears to be full of all
kinds of misfortune...

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.760
At this point, I don't fear death.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.290
What I fear is that,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.280
before killing me,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.480
the monsters up there

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.630
will squeeze every drop of information
from me that I have on the King...

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.040
Using any brutal means necessary.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.520
If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.040
The aura's strength

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.130
just confirms it...

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.210
This is as far as I go...

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.340
Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.840
My name is Leol, and don't forget it.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.090
I heard that I should expect
a crayfish and wolf.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.350
They're dealing with the grunts you created.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.100
So I can fight you one-on-one.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.100
I appreciate that.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.470
This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.960
No, he's a little stronger.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.610
Let's get started.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.370
Right now, allowing Knov to get
into the palace is the priority.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.370
Until that happens, I need to
divert the enemy's attention.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.380
That won't help.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.340
This is Marcos.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.000
Do you have the meat?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.650
Yes, as requested.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.000
Refrigerated trucks are entering
the underground warehouse...

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.160
They're shipping in food.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.880
If the information Marcos
provided was accurate,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.450
living women are also inside.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.650
Not for the King, but for the
lecherous Secretary Bizeff.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.300
If everything is going as planned,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.370
Palm should be inside.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.890
Leave the fourth truck as it is.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.200
Yes, sir.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.950
Then we'll be leaving.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.510
Area D, of the underground warehouse.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.710
My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.440
Now, please step out.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.050
There's nothing to worry about.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.810
From now on, you will work here.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.220
I've prepared rooms for each of you.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.270
You will be provided with all necessities.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.110
In your spare time, you may do as you want.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.330
As long as you don't attempt to escape.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.690
Your only job

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.340
is to follow my orders.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.110
When summoned, you must drop everything,

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.970
and come to see me at once.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.410
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.730
Excellent.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.400
You...

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.870
Come with me.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.900
Yes.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.050
The rest of you can wait in your rooms.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.550
Yes...

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.750
The Secretary was...

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.640
...interested in us!

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.150
I must find a way out of here,

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.760
so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.280
Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.860
the current whereabouts of
anyone she has seen previously.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.250
This power will allow her to keep tabs
on the King and Royal Guard.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.090
The Hunters will then be able to determine

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.210
the optimal route for the operation.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.390
Only one exit.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.850
I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.850
My mission is crucial for
increasing our chances

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.810
of defeating the King!

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.680
What matters most isn't that I succeed...

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.320
But that, should I fail and be captured,
I kill myself immediately.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.570
I should be safe here...

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.480
Palm...

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.030
Don't do anything foolish!

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.290
I managed to place the exits,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.950
so even if your mission doesn't succeed,
we can still execute the operation.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.380
If you get caught, it's over...

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.540
That...

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.650
That...

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.890
That vicious aura...

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.160
One look

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.980
was all it took

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.550
to break my will...

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.900
Gon... Killua...

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.150
You must have seen that aura...

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.610
You were probably even closer,
actually touching it...

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.780
Yet...

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.360
How are you still able

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.580
to face them?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.660
How can you bring yourself to fight?

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.530
Is it to save your friends?

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.590
To protect humanity?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.440
Why...

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.030
Why are you still fighting?

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.630
Palm!

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.230
Please...

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.130
Don't do anything foolish.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.230
I beg you...

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.850
If you're caught, it's all over...

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.120
Palm!

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.950
I won't be able...

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.250
to go back there...

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.910
I brought you something cold to drink.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.840
You're dismissed.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.370
Wait in your room.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.150
Yes.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.590
Your lack of familiarity with the
area has sealed your defeat.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.540
Though it's almost too perfect that,
after all that running,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.980
you ended up in an underground church.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.770
In case of emergency, this place
is used as an air shelter.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.440
An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.220
Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.490
I'm an atheist.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.320
You're a cocky guy.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.540
Let's see who's trapped whom.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.500
Cheetu told me everything.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.720
I hear you can mold that
smoke into various objects.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.790
Knowing that, he still chased me in here?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.730
Even better.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.200
If he believes things are going his way,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.240
he won't hesitate to display his abilities.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.900
However,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.470
I've yet to meet anyone whose power

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.740
allows them to react more
flexibly than Deep Purple.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.510
I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.250
Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.590
I really dig it.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.140
It's common sense to defeat an opponent
before they can use their power.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.210
But that isn't how men

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.930
should fight.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.240
Hey, what are you up to?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.900
Voluntarily removing one of your senses?

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.410
Have you heard of the band Black Planet?

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.410
Their second album is super cool.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.920
It's a twelve-song medley.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.420
Listening to the whole thing's
like reading a good book.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.310
When you finish it, you feel great.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.680
I know.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.010
And best part of all, the medley's
exactly sixty minutes long.

It's a masterpiece!

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.820

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.940
Rental, start!

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.170
This could be bad...

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.710
I have a hard time fighting

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.460
others who share my tastes.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.910
