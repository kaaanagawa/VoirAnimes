WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
That's Morel's Smoky Jail...

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.520
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.990
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.880
the King and Pitou aren't there.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.220
Where are they?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.030
Divide x And x Conquer

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.810
Each has begun his own battle

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.300
in his own respective location.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.970
Gon...

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.780
Grandpa!

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.540
Which means that that's...

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.810
the King!

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.300
Proceed.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.170
I am fully aware that you seek
to accomplish your objective

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.310
with minimal human casualties.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.850
You took advantage of the chaos in the palace

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.320
in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.180
It makes no difference.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.330
Proceed.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.940
Dragon Head!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.530
He is frightening...

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.100
The technique he unleashed was
not intended to hurt the King.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.530
And both of them could tell that the King

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.250
realized this at once.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.480
Zeno made certain that his <i>Nen</i>
was completely neutral.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.960
Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.780
Killua...

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.140
Pitou is over there.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.170
Let's go!

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.700
Let's go...

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.640
In what sense did you mean that?

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.530
Killua barely managed to stop himself
from asking the question.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.100
If I ask that question,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.160
I won't be able to stop anymore...

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.010
I won't be able to go back.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.050
If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.980
Anyone with enough experience
would easily arrive at that next step.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.060
But the fear of losing someone he cared for

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.290
prevented him from taking that step.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.270
A few moments before the dragon took flight,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.830
Cheetu and Brovada appeared

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.540
before Ikalgo.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.590
Hey, it's Flutter.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.520
What's with all the noise?

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.850
Pitou-dono's <i>En</i> disappeared again.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.040
I just returned...

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.350
It seems the enemy is attacking.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.720
Seriously?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.510
Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.040
What happened to your wings?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.600
Oh, uh...

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.080
I lost them earlier, during the attack.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.090
Are you going underground?

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.340
Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.790
What should we do?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.560
Well, we weren't told to defend this place...

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.590
But I'm just itching to try

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.770
my new technique.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.220
It's huge...

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.120
That looks fun!

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.900
I'm gonna check it out!

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.630
Be careful!

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.780
I'm gonna see what's going on!

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.310
Then, I'll be going.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.130
Okay.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.150
"Hagya-sama"?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.910
Meanwhile, in the throne room,
in the central tower...

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.040
Is it truly possible

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.680
to trap me in one place?

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.810
Why don't we find out?

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.820
Wing scales...

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.820
Knov said that they can hypnotize people.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.500
I don't want to inhale any...

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.450
You seem to be finished talking.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.980
I would expect that of anyone
with considerable power.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.330
However...

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.520
Caution, resolve,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.100
and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.250
His caution isn't as strong
because he's confident.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.860
It's safe to say he has a strong personality.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.310
Pouf's Spiritual Message

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:43.250
surrounds his opponent with wing scales,
making their aura more opaque,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.260
letting him sense their state of mind.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.010
I suppose I should introduce myself.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.960
I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.400
His caution has increased slightly.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.280
You won't tell me your name?

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.430
If you believe that I'm trying

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:27.910
to trick you into inhaling my wing
scales, you're sadly mistaken.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.910
And to be honest, I'm a little shocked.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.940
After a rebirth, all will be forgotten.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.930
I'll need you to wait a moment.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.150
If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.510
No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.860
Shoot was fighting recklessly,
without concern for his life,

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.460
which turned out to be the
reason he was still alive.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.090
Hotel Rafflesia...

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.150
While barely dodging multiple attacks that
would have been otherwise lethal,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:13.390
Shoot had only managed to take
the eye on Youpi's shoulder.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.280
He had essentially done no damage.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.240
However...

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.750
Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.830
The strange sensation that his momentum
was being stolen, rather than stopped,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.250
influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.000
After taking multiple hits from
attacks he didn't understand,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.760
Youpi was backing up.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.770
I can't let this guy near the King.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.150
Every second I keep him away
from the King counts.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.280
Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.260
However, this expected turn of events

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.040
was difficult on Knuckle...

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.700
Hold it in...

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.290
I can't attack now!

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.230
If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:27.550
that there's one more enemy
he needs to worry about!

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.060
Hold it in!

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.140
Shoot was now covered in blood,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.570
as he endured Youpi's ferocious
barrage of attacks.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.230
Forced to watch from the sidelines,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.100
just remaining hidden was a battle.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.580
No matter how he told himself to keep still...

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.800
Hold it in... Please hold it in!

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.810
Knuckle was unable to hold back the
tears streaming down his face.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.100
You can do it!

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.300
It's time.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.810
Adding interest.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.110
Only ten seconds have passed?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.740
You're kidding!

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:36.790
How much longer do I have to endure
this suffocating, excruciating wait

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.720
that makes me want to do nothing but run away?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.000
This must be some kind of joke...

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.180
And it isn't funny!

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.770
I can't hold it in any longer!

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.320
Knuckle's rampage was halted

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.660
by the first tap from Meleoron.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.080
Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.420
But that just might have saved me.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.490
Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.870
He, too, had reached his limit.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360
Crap!

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.370
Uh-oh.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.880
He barely scratched me, but it
was enough damage

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.580
to offset the interest and
my full-strength attack.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.130
Shoot is risking his life out there,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.840
while I'm standing here unhurt,
and making stupid mistakes!

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.560
Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.460
nor did he notice APR's declaration
of returned interest.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.470
Damn!

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.550
He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.820
Calm down, you fool...

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.980
You're gonna ruin everything.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.480
Here's the distance where we want to stay...

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.720
Not close enough for him to find us,
but close enough to get in fast.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.990
He'll notice APR for a second,
but that's no problem.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.990
Shoot's fighting hard,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.250
so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.160
God's Accomplice...

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.170
Undo.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.790
What is this thing?

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.390
When did it show up?

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.220
No, it can't be that I didn't notice it.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.900
It just suddenly appeared.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.300
Was I hit by an attack?

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.880
No, I wasn't.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.450
A delayed effect?

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.530
So it must have been then!

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.330
Does that mean the condition
was met during the fight?

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.880
What is this number?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.250
Is it a countdown? A bomb?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.150
No, the number isn't going up or down.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.260
This is too much of a pain!

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.270
I only need to destroy the source!

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.510
Something's coming.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.280
Despite his overwhelming power,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.200
one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.600
was the evident difference in
skill level between them.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.220
It's fast... I can't get away!

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.050
One skewered chunk of meat coming up!

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.090
He hit himself to accelerate.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.140
Very well...

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.790
That was close.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.360
The reaction to the attack told Youpi
that he could win at any moment.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.460
Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.940
so this spurred him on.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.600
Youpi's analysis was on the mark.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.030
It was true that Youpi was
increasingly likely to win this fight.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.180
If he made any mistake, it was not realizing

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.170
that Shoot was fine with this fact.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.390
I can keep going...

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.930
I...

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.560
can still fly.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.010
I'm not done...

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.310
However, quietly and surely...

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.010
Shoot was reaching his limit.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.690
Hey, Youpi!

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.330
Over here, fool!

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.690
Knuckle!

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.480
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.980
That's fine.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.230
That will serve to distract Youpi,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.110
and it will save Shoot.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.770
Bring it!

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.570
After calming down and regaining composure,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.380
Knuckle decided to show himself.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.150
Next time: Duty x And x Question.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.050
Huh? Where are you, Gon?

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.430
Over here.
