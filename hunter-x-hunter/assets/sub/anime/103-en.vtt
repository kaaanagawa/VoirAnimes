WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Gungi?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.250
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.160
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.410
Then, if I defeat this champion,
I'll be the best in the world?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.250
A fitting way to end this recreation.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.710
Bring them in.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Check x And x Mate

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.510
Six days remain before
Neferpitou begins the selection.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.010
The King has spent this time in his palace,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.980
defeating the masters of shogi,
Go, and other board games.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.580
The last remaining one,
the reigning Gungi world champion,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.770
has just been summoned to his side.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.060
U-Um...

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.290
Th-Thank you for infighting me—

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.700
For inciting me...

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.170
No need for small talk.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.610
You and I will play Gungi.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.430
Right now, I am learning the
rules, so you must wait.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.130
He's dead.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.440
Now I am the King.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.390
I'm s-so sorry!

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.940
Please forgive me!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.790
I'm only a fool, one who knows
nothing of the outside world!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.780
I can't even talk normally...

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.830
You are distracting me. Be silent.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.580
Or I'll kill you.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.300
Okay, I basically understand.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.970
Let us begin.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.690
What's wrong?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.690
It appears she's passed out.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.670
After you told her to be quiet,
she shut her mouth...

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.580
Then, since her nose was stuffed up,
it seems she was unable to breathe.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.950
This is an uncommonly stupid girl.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.700
Yeah, that was embarrassing!

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.830
I can't even do things a baby can.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.560
My parents are always yelling at me...

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.460
Just play the game.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.970
Yes!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.330
I'm honored to play against you.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.760
You can see with your eyes?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.290
No, I can't see a thing.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.490
So would you please tell me your moves?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.030
I only open them when I play.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.490
If it bothers you, I can try to close them...

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.500
I don't care.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.760
The atmosphere has changed.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.640
4-4-1, pawn.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.610
You can't reach him at all?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.900
No, I guess his phone is off.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.530
We agreed that he would initiate all contact,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.530
so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.410
Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.420
Why does that guy look like he
was born in the wrong decade?

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.050
And the look on his face says
he's always looking for a fight...

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.890
The other has no eyebrows,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.030
and that expression makes it
clear that he trusts no one.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.120
It's not even a question of
whether he and I can get along.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.320
I can already see he won't believe a word I say.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.520
Gon, I'm sorry to say that my
first impression is very bad!

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.460
Unless I get some really good news soon,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.070
there's no way I'll be able to trust them.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.960
I guarantee it.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.460
Hey, what's all this?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.670
Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.350
They have collars...

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.840
He's been feeding all the animals
left behind due to the selection.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.360
He's even sacrificed sleep...

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.360
I'm not feeding all of them!

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.360
I know we don't have time to waste on that!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600
So I abandoned those that stood no chance.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.830
That's efficient, yeah?

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.950
Some were just skin and bones,
but still wouldn't take my food.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.280
Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave
their homes after I untied them...

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.720
What's so bad about saving
the ones that want the help?!

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.110
You don't have to cry about it.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.400
I'm n-not crying, fool!

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.980
Want me to smack you?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.480
That won't be enough to raise my opinion.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.090
Well, he certainly is different, though.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.580
7-8-2, spy.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.760
Checkmate.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.810
She's using an orthodox approach,
stacking archers on her pawns.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.020
A standard strategy.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.900
Textbook execution.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.780
And her initial placement
is one used with beginners.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.030
Meaning that I am not good enough
for her to show her true skill.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.280
Another game.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.410
Yes, absolutely!

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.650
8-8-1, knight.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.550
I guess that's checkmate.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.600
You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.360
I'll have to step up my game,
or you'll get the jump on me!

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.570
That's enough... Go get some rest.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.390
That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.120
I can play Gungi for three days
and nights without sleep!

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.200
I have another guest.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.480
Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.730
Then I'll get a little rest.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.940
What do you think?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.850
It's but a matter of time.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.700
There are more options to choose from,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.360
but essentially, this game is
no different than the rest.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.240
In four or five more games, she will
have to use her real ability.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.330
Once that happens, I shall be
able to observe her rhythm.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.240
Nothing has changed.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.500
Your Majesty,

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.000
the Go player hanged himself.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.110
Bring that idiot back.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:51.000
While the King continues to play
against the Gungi master,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.670
a short distance away, Morel has
been using his power to surround

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.790
the capital city of Peijing.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.420
Purple Haze Soldiers
Deep Purple

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.420
Deep Purple.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.180
First, he releases the aura that serves as a core.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.920
He then envelops it in an aura haze,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:31.750
creating a smoke puppet that he can
control at will via the <i>Nen</i> within the core.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.450
His ability can sustain two hundred
and sixteen puppets at once.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.930
On the chance that the enemy retaliates,
I've made my soldiers more responsive,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.960
so I can only maintain fifty now.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.960
But they're much stronger.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.980
One advantage is that </i>En<i> can't differentiate

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.260
between one of these and a human.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.480
But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.820
So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.840
As expected, Neferpitou has recalled
the controlled humans to the capital

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.060
to take up defensive positions.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:17.070
That implies the King's safety is top priority.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.830
Which means that restricting the movement
of the Royal Guard is very easy.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.830
However, the question is how the King will respond.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.590
If we're dealing with a King who does as he
likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.340
And the risk of miscalculation increases.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.970
But as long as they keep
these coming, we're fine.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.230
Long time, no see.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.480
I've been looking for you.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.480
Bah, he's gotten stronger.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.850
The air about him feels totally different.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.870
Knuckle's APR is gone?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.490
It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.450
If something had happened,
Knuckle's group would have contacted me.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.530
If APR is gone,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.010
<i>they have someone who can dispel</i> Nen.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.830
Or did he do it himself?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.640
Let's see what they can do.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.140
Whichever wins...

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.390
In the end,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.490
I will triumph.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.400
Time to return the favor.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.780
First, I'll beat you down.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.330
Then it's the pompadour's turn.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.540
His confidence is far from baseless.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.390
He must have gained a new ability.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.170
I wouldn't be so certain!

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.670
<i>If that ability is to exorcise</i> Nen,
<i>we're in trouble.</i>

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.820
Knuckle and Shoot both use
hit-and-fade fighting styles.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.000
Shoot does what he can to support
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.570
<i>But we can't nullify their</i> Nen <i>with ours</i>

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.370
if they have someone who can dispel it.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.490
A strategy that might have worked
against the King is useless now.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.870
However...

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.980
<i>if he has the ability to exorcise</i> Nen,
<i>this is a good opportunity.</i>

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.880
If I neutralize him here, Knuckle
and Shoot can use their powers.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.090
I must fight...

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:46.390
I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have
to get by on my remaining aura.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.900
What?

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.400
He's still relying on speed?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.280
There are plenty of ways to deal with
someone who only uses speed.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.660
Now you're "It."

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.160
Huh? What was that?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.930
Wh-Where am I?

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.360
A savannah?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.430
Did he teleport me?

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.250
If this is his new ability,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.900
<i>a different Chimera Ant is the</i> Nen <i>exorcist.</i>

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.440
That's bad.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.690
Sure you should just be standing around?

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.570
It's time to start

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.640
this game of tag.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.570
Tag?

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.120
We're in a field that I created.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.330
Unless you touch me, you can't leave.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.260
Your time limit is eight hours.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.260
Let's start!

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.640
Hey!

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.510
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.150
You can't leave without touching me!

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.910
If I chase you, I'll never catch you.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.410
So I'm going to take my time.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.790
Morel disappeared with the enemy!

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.550
Cheetu has activated his power...

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.560
I don't know what it does, but they
won't be back for eight hours.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.560
The scenery is just a wall.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.940
Looks like I'm in some kind of space
separated from the real world, like he said.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.200
Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:19.210
If I stopped Deep Purple, I could
break out of here with ease.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.550
However...

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.980
First, is it even possible for me to stop
Deep Purple from within this space?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.790
Second, if I'm able to stop it,

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.460
will that aura return to me here, in this space?

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.740
The worst scenario would be one
in which I stop Deep Purple,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.840
but the aura can't reach me in this space.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.370
Once Deep Purple is halted,

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.630
it can't be reactivated until
I've recovered the aura.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.740
It's too risky to try.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.870
I can't stop Deep Purple.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.130
At least, not yet.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.880
Are you finally ready to start?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.680
This way! Follow my lead!

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.570
Hold on, you aren't gonna...

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.690
You bet I am!

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.300
It's a waste of time.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.660
You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.540
There's only one way out.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.420
And that's to catch me.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.920
I can tell that

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.930
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
has weakened his power...

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.920
So then...

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.010
Hey, what happens if I don't touch
you within the time limit?

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.940
Who knows?

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.940
I have no obligation to answer that question.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.730
Naturally, of course not.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.790
It appears there's more to this ability.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.820
I'm in for the long haul, then.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.580
Wake me up in five hours.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.830
Are you mocking me?

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.380
Go ahead, lose your temper.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.350
It seems you don't understand your own power.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.350
This isn't a battle of speed.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.300
It's a battle of mental fortitude.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.380
Deep Purple is still active...

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.960
So the operation continues.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.880
Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.990
It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.380
Anyone else around?

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.890
No, just the figures in white.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.600
Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.130
But it's possible that the true leader
is concealed among them.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.280
And I can't let anyone see my power.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.960
And Hirin is occupied with
exorcising the </i>Nen<i> on Cheetu...

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.030
Damn...

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.520
I need at least two more pawns!

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:49.520
Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.550
The King is nearly finished playing games.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.120
After that, the King will insist on
defeating his enemies himself.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.680
We will be there to guard him, but
you never know what might happen...

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:08.190
We would rather the King remain
inside until the selection is over.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.320
Do you need something?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.750
Give Leol a hand.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.250
Yes, as you wish.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.280
Well?

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.450
I am becoming worried.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.320
They've played many times, but
the King is nowhere near victory.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.330
This player is a true master...

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.040
I should have been able to break
her defenses from the left side.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.850
But she used a peculiar move
sequence to turn the tables.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.980
4-5-1, musketeer.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.610
2-8-2, fortress.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.620
What?

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.930
The spy has done nothing this entire match...

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.370
But suddenly, it controls the board!

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.630
My right side's been destroyed.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.580
I'm done. That's checkmate.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.880
Impossible.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.390
From start to checkmate, there were
one hundred, forty-four moves.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.590
This outcome could have only happened
if she foresaw each of my moves.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.770
On to the next game.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.770
Yes!

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.980
This is utterly impossible!

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.030
A storm is brewing.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.740
The girl's strength upsets the King.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.040
And a storm draws near the palace.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.290
Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.650
Please go easy on us.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.420
Clack.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.130
Whack.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.090
Whoosh.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.030
Clang.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.260
Checkmate.
