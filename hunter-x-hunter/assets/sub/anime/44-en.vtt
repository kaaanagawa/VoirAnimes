WEBVTT

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.450
I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.950
Which group do you belong to?

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.760
We're bodyguards for
the Nostrade Family.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.460
I see.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.460
It seems that you can use <i>Nen</i>,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080
but don't bother.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.470
These aren't ordinary thugs.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.720
To them, taking lives is like breathing.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.520
Y-You could say they're
professional killers.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.350
And a pro knows his trade best of all.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.730
Rabid Dog.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.230
I'm Leech.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.780
I-I'm Porcupine.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.040
We Shadow Beasts will see to them.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.040
Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.180
After the Phantom Troupe's
raid on the auction,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
Uvogin has single-handedly
annihilated the Mafia pursuit.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.470
Now, they watch the arrival

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.480
of the secret weapon dispatched
by the Mafia's Ten Dons,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.330
the Shadow Beasts.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.490
Man...

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.030
Not one of them put up much of a fight.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.830
Uvo!

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.790
Yeah?

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.110
Here they come.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.120
Hey, don't interfere.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.560
I still haven't gotten to enjoy myself.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.540
Jeez...

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.070
Let Uvo handle it.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.570
Care for a round, Feitan?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.000
He's going to fight the
Shadow Beasts by himself?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.720
The Shadow Beasts, huh?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.570
Where did you hide the merchandise?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.100
What happened to all the
guards and guests?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.620
We killed them.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.100
So where's the merchandise?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.610
If you don't answer me...

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.050
That stung.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.900
Now you can't escape...

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.750
Make your choice.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.270
Do you want to die
underground, at my hands?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.730
Or on the surface, at the
hands of the other three?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.720
Idiot.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.550
Here he goes.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.050
Uvo's getting serious...

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.170
Four.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.930
You're the one

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.930
who can't escape!

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.960
Big Bang Impact:
Fist of Destruction

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.570
I-I don't believe it!

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.910
I've never seen a <i>Nen</i> user
of this caliber before.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.360
That's...

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.240
A spider tattoo.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.060
Then he's...

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.390
Spider...

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.530
Poor chap.
Not much left of him.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.360
Uvo's Big Bang Impact
packs a powerful punch.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.280
Honestly...

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.030
He's just throwing a straight right,
with a little added <i>Nen</i>.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.360
Eight.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.580
Nine.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.630
Ten.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.540
Okay, who's dying next?

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.710
The Phantom Troupe, huh?

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.480
He sounds pretty confident.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.980
You're the one who will die next!

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.640
Fool.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.630
Nice...

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.510
I like reckless opponents.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.970
But you're still going to die!

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.330
I can manipulate my body hair at will.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.230
I can even turn it into hard spikes, yup.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.130
You throw a strong punch,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.490
but it's meaningless if
you can't connect, yup.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.760
They managed to damage

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.550
Uvogin's iron skin with nothing
but body hair and teeth.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.880
Must be skilled <i>Nen</i> users.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.450
I'm impressed.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.460
Thirteen.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.610
No way!

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.900
Sorry.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.130
Want a hand, Uvo?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.140
Keep out of this!

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.660
Damn it...

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.900
It's futile.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.650
You can't shake off thousands of spikes

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.530
once they've penetrated your skin, yup.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.380
Then I'll use you as my fist!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.280
Since I can manipulate it at will,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.000
I can relax certain sections of
my body hair as necessary, yup.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.360
We've got Muscles on the ropes.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.130
That's bull.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.800
You're damned tough.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.730
Did it finally kick in?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.240
My fangs secrete a tranquilizer

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.980
that's meant to instantly incapacitate you...

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.580
Bastard...

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.600
Everything from the neck up is unaffected,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.120
so you can still feel pain and fear.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.950
So sit back and enjoy.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.960
If he were using a lethal poison,
this fight would be over.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.710
I'm sure he likes to torture opponents.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.520
I keep numerous leeches
of all sizes within me...

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.990
They'll enter your body
through your wounds,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.730
and deposit their eggs in your bladder.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.730
These spotted leeches are
a gift from me to you.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.660
You're totally disgusting!

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.190
Most people die from the
excruciating pain

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.050
of hundreds of millions of leeches

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.730
as they hatch inside their bodies.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.200
Yuck.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.630
I thought that uglier usually
meant better-tasting.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.240
Why are you surprised?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.980
You aren't the only one
who can use his teeth.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.490
Everything from my neck up
is all I need to defeat you.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.310
They're going to lose...

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.830
The Shadow Beasts will lose.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.540
They're going to lose...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.030
The Shadow Beasts will lose.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.240
Defeat us?

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.610
Heh.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.090
You can't bite me when I'm
all the way over here.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.830
A bullet?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.630
No...

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.990
It's a fragment of Leech's
skull that he bit off!

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.460
He's going to do the same to me?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.030
But it won't work...

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.040
My body hair will repel
any projectile, yup.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.160
Huh?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.220
You can't repel sound projectiles, can you?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.910
Oh, you can't hear me anymore?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.800
He used sound to defeat
a Shadow Beast.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.800
They're all crazy...

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.560
You idiot!

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.040
Give us a warning first!

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.330
What if our eardrums had burst?

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.810
Sorry about that!

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.890
But that would've given my plan away.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.680
Besides, you guys had plenty
of time to cover your ears

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.910
before the sound reached you.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.240
That's true.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.950
Wait, Kurapika!

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.390
What are you doing?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.220
Shouldn't that be obvious?

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.620
I'm going to capture him.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.610
It's impossible!

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.780
You saw what he's capable of!

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.850
You're going to get yourself killed!

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.090
Kurapika!

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.390
I really don't care.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.700
I hear tremendous rage and hatred.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.290
He's completely lost control.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.610
Kurapika!

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.620
He will definitely get himself killed.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.120
I cannot leave him in this state.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.120
Stop, Kurapika!

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.480
Wild Flower.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.870
The perfect song to relax you.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.740
Has everyone calmed down?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.620
Let's cool our heads,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.340
and devise a plan together.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.620
Y-Yeah...

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.770
What kind of abilities do the
other members possess?

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.080
I bet they're all ridiculously strong...

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.900
Melody...

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.630
Hmm?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.500
Thank you.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.890
I've cooled down now.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.160
However, I still must capture them.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:58.610
Leader,

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.490
I can make this happen.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.650
What?

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.580
Let me go.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.660
After witnessing that
incredible show of strength,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.110
you still believe you can defeat him?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.660
Of course.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.970
I understand.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.240
Bring the car, so we can
leave at a moment's notice.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.050
R-Right.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.350
Shizuku!

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.190
Would you suck the poison and
leeches from my body?

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.410
Your vacuum will do the trick.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.200
Blinky can suck out poison,
but nothing alive.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.310
What?

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.380
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.860
Let me see.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.810
This is a spotted leech...

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.750
It takes one day to migrate to the bladder,

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.950
before laying its eggs and dying.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.650
So?

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.680
The eggs will hatch shortly after,
exiting through your urinary tract.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.320
It will cause enough pain to kill you.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.210
Hey, don't joke around...

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:13.740
However, they require a specific
ammonia level to hatch.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.340
If there isn't enough,

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.220
the eggs don't hatch, and they
can be excreted harmlessly.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.940
So, until this time tomorrow,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.710
you should drink beer non-stop,
and be sure to urinate frequently!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.850
Don't scare me like that...

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.010
Shizuku, can you take care of the poison?

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.990
Yes.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.780
Someone go to the city
and get lots of beer.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.990
I'll go.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.540
Make sure they're ice-cold!

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.870
Don't get too greedy!

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.430
Okay, get that poison out of me.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.130
Huh?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.030
Did you see that?

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.150
Yeah.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.330
Those chains came from nowhere,
to wrap around his body.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.360
Is it a new Shadow Beast?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.240
Uvo can't move because of the tranquilizer,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.570
and the leeches are still inside him.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.840
Then that's that...
Let's go and save him.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.330
Good grief.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.770
He's so much trouble.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.340
I have a trace for now.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.720
I used <i>In</i> to conceal the thread.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.980
So as long as they don't use
<i>Gyo</i> to spot the needle,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.850
I can follow them anywhere.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.100
Okay, let's find them
before they notice it.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.360
This is our chance to finish the
remaining Shadow Beasts.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.420
Franklin, we're counting on you
to bring back lots of beer.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.500
Man, the chase sounds more fun...

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.370
Let's go!

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.870
Indeed.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.010
The spiders...

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.880
We'd need all the remaining members

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.530
just to stand a chance...

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.310
Understood.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.590
Chains...

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.460
Hey, driver...

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.940
You think these chains can hold me?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.300
If you don't kill me now,
you'll regret it later.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.420
Shut up.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.380
Don't you understand?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.930
This is a golden opportunity.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.430
Stop wasting time, and just...

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.320
I told you to shut up!

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.320
Kurapika, watch...

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.410
Watch the road!

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.820
How can he be this strong?

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.840
Even if my body weren't paralyzed,
I'd still be having trouble...

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.360
He's put enough Nen into these chains

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.490
to keep a master Enhancer in check?

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.840
<i>Chain Jail.</i>

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.350
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.730
<i>This power can only be used on the spiders...</i>

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.280
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.490
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.490
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.290
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.750
A self-imposed restriction.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.810
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:21.260 position:80% line:20%
A self-imposed restriction.
A covenant with myself.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260
The proof of my resolve.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.880 line:20%
Look out, Kurapika...

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.340
The risk is high.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.180 line:20%
Watch the road!

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.270
But the stronger my resolve,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.730
the stronger my Nen!

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.910
Kurapika has captured a member

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.030
of the Phantom Troupe, his sworn enemies.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.670
Armed with resolve and the
willingness to risk his life,

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.250
an intense battle is about to begin.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.280
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:16.420
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.240
Today, we introduce the Shadow Beasts.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.740
A fighting force formed
by the Ten Dons.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.110
A fighting force serving the Mafia community's

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.580
There are ten members,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.180
Ten Dons.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.580
So who are they?

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:16.150
all named after
animals and insects.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.170
Owl, Worm, Rabid Dog, Porcupine...

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.620
And Leech—

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.010
Next time: Restraint x And x Vow!

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.410
Killua, don't run in the hallway.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.240
Limbatics counts as walking.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.310
Promise to follow the rules!
