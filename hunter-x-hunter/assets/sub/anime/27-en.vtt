WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Train and earn money?

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.480
The Heavens Arena.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.670
Heavens Arena...

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.330
Yeah, I'll explain later.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.360
We should get moving.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.190
Okay!

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.020
Whoa.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.490
Look, it's huge!

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.080
Yep.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.510
That's Heavens Arena.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.590
Two hundred and fifty-one stories.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.080
Nine hundred, ninety-one meters tall.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.050
The world's fourth tallest building.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.990
So this is where we'll be training...

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.110
I used up all my money on the trip fare.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.700
We'll have to make more here.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.610
After we disembark, we'll start from zero.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610
Okay, got it.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.920
Good... Let's go.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.120
Yeah!

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120
Arrival x At The x Arena

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.670
Gon and Killua

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.760
head to Heavens Arena,
seeking to get stronger.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.630
Gon.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.050
There's a really long line.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.760
Everyone's going to Heavens Arena?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.320
There aren't any conditions here,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.780
like there were for the Hunter Exam.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990
You just have to defeat your opponent.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.490
Oh...

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.910
The higher you go, the more
prize money you earn.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.380
This is as good as it gets for those looking

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.360
to make a living with their fists.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.110
Welcome to Heavens Arena.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.120
Please fill out this form.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.620
Killua Zoldyck-sama, you are #2054.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.500
Gon Freecss-sama, you are #2055.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.160
They'll call your number

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.120
on the first floor of the arena,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.050
so make sure you remember it.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.570
Then please go ahead.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.490
Go!

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.530
Take him out!

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.840
It's been a while,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.370
but the place hasn't changed.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.530
Huh? You've been here before?

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.400
Yeah, when I was six.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.430
My dad left me here without a penny.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.580
He said I should reach floor 200
before coming home.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.500
It took two years.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.290
<i>Two years...</i>

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.550
<i>Sure, he was only six, but it
really took Killua that long?</i>

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.290
If you want to fight people of Hisoka's level,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.520
you'll need to go higher.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.370
Let's hurry.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.560
Okay.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.150
#1973.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.460
#2055.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.810
Please enter ring E.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.230
#2055! That's me!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.810
I'm getting nervous now.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.950
Gon, you got through the
Testing Gate, right?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.660
Huh?

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.910
In that case...

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.220
Look at that! It's a little boy!

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.620
Hey, kid!

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.170
This is your last chance to run!

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.820
This ain't a game!

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.550
One punch, and he'll fly out of the ring!

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.680
On the first floor, we appraise
each participant's level.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.980
You are allowed three minutes

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.960
to demonstrate your prowess.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.310
Then... Begin!

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.060
Sorry...

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.910
I'll end your suffering with one punch.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.900
You got through the Testing Gate, right?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.990
In that case, all you have
to do is push hard.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.950
Just push

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.450
hard!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.870
No way!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.080
Yes!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.640
That kid's incredible!

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.590
He's got some crazy power!

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.970
When did I become so strong?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.820
#2055, proceed to floor 50.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.350
All right!

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.100
Hey, here's another kid who's a beast!

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.350
Oh?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.320
You've already been to the 200th floor?

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.880
And this was a strong performance.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.040
Very well. You may go to the 180th floor...

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.810
Oh, I'll start from the 50th floor.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.630
Huh?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.380
I want to take it easy.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.760
That's enough!

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.070
Yet another strong kid there!

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.100
You are permitted to
advance to the 50th floor.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.020
Osu!

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.170
The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.780
are divided into classes,
each comprised of ten floors.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.620
So after someone defeats an
opponent in the 50s,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.280
they advance to the 60s.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.400
If they lose, then they'd
drop back to the 40s.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.000
Oh, so that's how it works.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.960
Plus...

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.570
I've heard that

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.540
after you pass the 100th floor,
you get your own room!

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.210
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.050
Osu! My name is Zushi!

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.470
What about you guys?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.790
I'm Killua.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.860
I'm Gon.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.060
Nice to meet you.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.390
We've arrived at the 50th floor.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.260
I saw your fight earlier.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.090
That was really amazing!

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.750
What are you talking about?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.190
You made it up here with one match, too.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.320
That's right.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.480
No...

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.430
I still have a long way to go.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.240
By the way, which martial arts
discipline do you practice?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.830
I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.590
School? We don't have one, right?

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.330
No...

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.630
What?

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.870
You're that strong with no training?

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.270
I'm kind of shocked...

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.870
I still have so far to go!

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.720
Zushi.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.480
You did well.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.720
Master!

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.970
You adhered to my teachings.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.940
Osu! I am honored!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.730
Master, your shirt is untucked again.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.280
Oh, sorry about that...

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.470
Who are they?

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.740
Oh, these are Killua-san and Gon-san.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.740
Nice to meet you. I'm Wing.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.260
Osu!

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.230
I didn't expect to meet other children.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.250
Why are you here?

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.470
Uh...

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.130
Well, we want to become stronger.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.930
But we're also broke,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.460
so we're making money simultaneously.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.010
Killua's a veteran here.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.390
Oh?

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.840
If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.050
but you should pay strict attention

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.600
to your opponent's body,
as well as your own.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.730
Osu!

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.800
Killua-sama, Gon-sama, and Zushi-sama?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.490
Please hand me your tickets.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.030
Here is your prize money.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.170
One hundred, fifty-two jenny...

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.080
On the 1st floor, win or lose,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.020
your reward covers a canned drink.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.590
But beyond that,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.100
a loss gets you nothing.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.270
A win over an opponent in the 50s
nets you fifty thousand.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.460
Fifty thousand...

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.360
That's a lot.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.600
In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.580
What?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.040
Once you're past the 150th floor,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.150
you get ten million a pop.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.760
Ten million?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.490
Didn't you make it to floor 200
when you were here before?

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.450
Th-The 200th floor?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.900
How much do you get for
winning on the 200th floor?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.670
Well... I don't really know,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.890
because I quit once I reached 200.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.460
But when I was winning in the 190s,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.460
I had around two hundred million, total.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.630
T-Two hundred million...

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.170
Where's that money now?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.970
That was four years ago.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.640
Of course it's gone now.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.560
Spent it all on snacks!

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.810
Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.560
What kind of snacks are these?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.460
Hey, let's head to the waiting room.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.060
We didn't take any damage in the last fight,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.780
so they'll probably assign us
another match today.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.820
Well, these opponents should be a cinch.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.090
Just take it easy.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.080
Really?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.010
Killua-san!

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.840
You're too loud...

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.920
#2054, Killua-sama.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.090
I'm already up.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.440
And #1963, Zushi-sama.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.220
What?

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.840
Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.100
Oh.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.910
Osu! I shall give it my best.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.410
Sure. Well, you can't win them all.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.080
Better luck next time.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.810
I'll head out.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.650
Yeah. Good luck, guys.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.240
I'll wait for you above.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.410
Uh-huh...

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.190
He really didn't have to be so blunt...

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.280
Okay, everyone!

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.800
The event you've all been waiting for!

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.480
We have a unique match-up for you!

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.330
Two young boys, fighting it out!

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.750
However, you don't want to
underestimate them!

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.730
Both had strong showings
in their first rounds!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.270
They both advanced directly to the 50s!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.990
We will now replay

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.850
their matches on the big screen!

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.990
Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.910
One chop was all it took to knock him out!

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.240
Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.940
to punish his opponent,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.420
scoring a flawless knockout
of a 200-plus kilogram giant!

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.800
Okay, everyone!

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.460
Are you ready to press
your gamble switches?

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.180
In that case, switch on!

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.650
All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.520
Perhaps his martial arts
knowledge gives him an edge?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.300
<i>This is bad...</i>

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.440
<i>Killua-san is mad...</i>

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.250
This match will consist of three,
three-minute rounds,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.310
decided by the points and knockout system!

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.200
Begin!

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.200
I see.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.880
His stance leaves few openings.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.960
He's trained long and hard
to master that stance.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.960
But he has no chance against me.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.710
Wow... Killua is

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.720
boldly walking toward his opponent!

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.920
Sorry.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.620
But I'm sticking to one chop per
match until I reach the 150s.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.310
Clean hit!

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.120
Amazing!

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.830
Killua has knocked out another
opponent with only a single chop!

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.650
A clean hit and a knockdown
get him 2 points.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.440
As you already know, under the
points and knockout system,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.340
there are clean hits, critical hits,
and knockdowns.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.990
Superb attacks count as "clean hits,"
worth one point apiece.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.610
Unusually superb attacks

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.980
are classified as "critical hits,"
worth two points.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.170
Knocking down your opponent
earns you one point.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.270
After amassing ten points, you are
awarded a technical knockout.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.750
Of course, if your opponent cannot
continue to fight after one hit,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.250
you win due to a knockout!

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.430
That chop ended the fight, stupid.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.890
Can you fight?

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.310
Yes, I'm okay!

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.380
He got up!

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.550
Zushi will continue!

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.150
Fight!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.280
Did I hold back too much?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.830
He's taken another hit!

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.080
Zushi has been knocked down!

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.360
But he's already standing up!

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.300
If you stand before the referee reaches you,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.340
your opponent isn't awarded the point.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.280
Tsk. Not bad.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.470
So the same attack won't
work twice against you.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.790
But something's wrong.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.580
That attack was strong enough that a graze

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.520
should have rendered him unconscious.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.890
Unbelievable...

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.130
He has dominating power and speed!

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.530
At this rate, I won't stand a chance!

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500
I have to...

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.530
try it!

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.930
Oh! What's happening?

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.270
Killua has backed away!

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.020
Zushi!

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.480
So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.540
interrupted the fight,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.300
but let's get started again!

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.550
Oh, Killua!

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.800
Over here!

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.330
See? I got sixty thousand.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.440
How about you?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.520
It took you a while to get here.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.770
Yeah, I ran into a little trouble.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.140
Then Zushi was pretty strong.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.070
No, not at all.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.060
He has potential.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.800
One day, he'll be strong.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.070
But right now,

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.060
he's just target practice for me.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.510
His punches were weak...

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.580
I was completely able to knock him around.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.540
But I couldn't defeat him.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.490
Huh?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.010
I received the TKO from points,

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.470
but I couldn't knock him out.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.220
Further...

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.560
When he changed his stance,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.530
his aura reminded me of my brother's.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:03.040
I don't know what it was,
but it felt dangerous.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.440
It must be some kind of technique.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.900
His master

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.340
called it "Ren."

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.950
Forgive me, Master!

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.550
I thought I made myself clear, Zushi.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.670
You were not supposed to use Ren yet.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.160
Forgive me!

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.210
My opponent was so strong,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.920
I couldn't help myself...

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.540
Sure. Wanting to win is good.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.970
But your true goal lies beyond this.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.570
At this tower's top floor.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.040
Focus too much on simply winning a fight,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.420
and you reduce your own potential.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980
Osu!

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.920
You must be prepared to lose a
thousand times while you're here.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.000
Osu!

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.540
So he isn't supposed

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.000
to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.210
The strongest fighters are at the top, right?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.500
Gon, change in plans.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.920
Huh?

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.920
I'm aiming to reach the top floor!

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.240
Uh-huh!

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.630
<i>Actually, that was my goal all along.</i>

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.430
Killua defeats another opponent
with one chop!

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.110
A knockout!

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.070
Oh! In the other arena,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.830
Gon has knocked out another opponent

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.580
with a single push!

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.350
Each of them has won six
consecutive matches

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.960
over the past three days,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.230
to reach the 100s without a scratch!

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.710
Killua's chop.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.690
And Gon's push.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.950
How far will they be able to go?

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.500
And who is going to be able to stop them?

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.480
Yay! A private room!

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.490
We won't have to worry about
money and lodging anymore.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.420
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.710
If you drop

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.320
below the 100s, you have to
check out of this room.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.450
A world of difference separates making it

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.360
to the 100s and staying in the 100s.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.640
The 100th floor is like a ceiling.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.670
A ceiling?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.470
Once you pass it, you get special treatment.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.300
So everyone focuses on holding their spot.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.780
Some people will do anything it takes

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.890
to stay in the 100s.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.810
You can waste a lot of time on them.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.400
Be careful, Gon.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.360
Yeah.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.770
Gon wins another match
with a single push!

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.480
Guess I didn't need to worry about him.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.370
Your prize money has been deposited
into the specified account.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.860
You were right...

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.680
I've never seen so many zeros before...

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.240
And just a week ago, I was totally broke.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.320
I'm a little annoyed.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.690
Huh?

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.030
My first time here,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.190
it took me two months to reach floor 150.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.140
Meanwhile, you're breezing through.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.700
But you were only six back then.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.700
Well, that's true...

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.990
Oh, that's right.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.130
I saw Zushi on TV earlier.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.280
So did I.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.560
He's still in the 50s.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.590
I wonder what that Ren you sensed

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.550
could have been.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.130
Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.750
Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.150
Ren is one of the four major principles.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.320
The four major principles for
disciplining your mind and body.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.160
Fundamental to every martial art!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.780
You must know "Ten," learn "Zetsu,"

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.510
achieve "Ren," and reach "Hatsu"!

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.540
This is all part of "Nen" training!

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.670
That covers everything!

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.140
I've no idea what you just said!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.790
Zushi...

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.130
Are you sufficiently educated
that you can teach others?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.500
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.070
There's an old saying

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.570
that if you learn something piecemeal,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.810
you'll end up knowing less
than when you started.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.630
So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.320
But I want to know right now.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.610
Because it's related to the secret
behind my brother's power.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.830
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.960
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.460
I'll agree to the full learning process
rather than a quick explanation!

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.060
And if you're willing to teach me,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.460
I won't try to figure it out myself.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.470
I understand.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.450
Come with me to my residence.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.980
What is Nen? What is Ren?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.120
Killua believes they are related
to his brother's abilities.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.240
Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:02.030
Brush your teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:02.030
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.860
Coming up, it's Gon

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.600
and Killua's

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.320
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.350
and Killua's

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.030
Hunterpedia!

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.300
Today, we introduce Zushi!

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:12.410
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.740
Learning Shingen-ryu kung fu
from Wing.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.340
He practices Shingen-ryu kung fu.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.950
He's considered a one in a hundred thousand talent!

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.040
Very polite and earnest.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.130
But we're considered one in a hundred million talents!

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.370
He talks in a loud voice.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.790
Osu!

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.090
Next time: Nen x And x Nen!

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.890
