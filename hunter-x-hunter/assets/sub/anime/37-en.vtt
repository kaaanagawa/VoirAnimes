WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
He's so far away...

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.780
But he's not out of reach.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.970
I need more training in Nen...

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.240
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.090
Mito-san!

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.090
Mito-san!

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.160
Mito-san!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.180
Gon...

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.780
Gon!

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.330
Mito-san!

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.110
I'm home, Mito-san.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.130
Welcome home, Gon.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.370
You must be Killua, right?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.130
Ging x And x Gon

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.630
Sheesh,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.630
you should have let me know
you were coming home.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.140
I didn't have time to prepare anything.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.640
It's not a big deal, whatever is fine.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.400
What are you saying?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030
Your friend came all the
way out here to visit.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.140
No, it's okay.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.040
Honestly, you should have
said something first...

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.200
Are you listening to me?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.910
Oh, that's right...

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.050
Take a bath while I make
something to eat.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.140
And put out your dirty clothes.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.260
I'll be doing laundry.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.440
Okay, later.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.160
Now!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.670
You have ten seconds!

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.760
One.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.830
Two.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.880
Three.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.870
Is she always like this?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.080
Four.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.060
Five.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.430
Pretty much.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.160
Six.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.150
Let's move fast!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Seven.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.920
Eight.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.720
Nine.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.970
Yeah, this is the life...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.680
Okay, let's eat.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.100
Wow!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.690
This looks delicious.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.370
What are you doing?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.370
Offering our thanks.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.830
What does that mean?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.370
All right...

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.110
Let's dig in.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400
Please help yourself, Killua.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.250
Right.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.050
Oh, right, Mito-san.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.020
Look!

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.300
This is a Hunter License.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.900
Hmm...

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.750
It looks pretty normal.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.070
There.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.620
Hey, what are you doing?

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.260
Just kidding...

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.040
I would never do anything like that.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.280
Man, what if it doesn't work anymore?

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.310
Mito-san, I'm going to show
Killua around the island.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.390
Won't that take a while?

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.180
Want me to pack some food for you?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.000
That's okay!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.430
We'll find something to eat in the forest.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.150
Gon and his friend are rather late.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.990
It's been a while since he
was last on this island.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.530
And he's brought his first friend along.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.660
I'm sure they won't be back until it's late.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.860
You're right...

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.680
Maybe I should take some
food out to them.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.310
Hey, Gon.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.310
What are you going to do now?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.710
For now, I'll rest up here

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.100
while I gather information...

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.410
The information I'll need before I go
to Yorknew to look for my dad.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.380
Oh...

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.930
What should I do?

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.660
Huh?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.770
You should stay here and then
go to Yorknew with me!

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.530
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.510
That wasn't what I meant.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.860
I was thinking you're sort of admirable.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.970
There's nothing I really want to do...

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.900
I don't really have anything
I want to do like you do.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.600
Though there are plenty of
things I don't want to do.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.410
I don't want to stay in that house...

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.780
Or inherit the family business.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.540
I guess I'm a little jealous.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.800
Killua...

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.430
I think it's fun to be with you.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.060
Wh-What's that about?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.430
Whale Island

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.450
is a place for fishermen to stay
during extended outings.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.640
There aren't too many native residents.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.710
There's one other kid here that's
around my age, and she's a girl.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.820
So you're my first friend who's the same age.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.200
My situation was similar...

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.370
Stuck in that house all day.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.830
I spent all my time learning how to kill.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.470
You were my first friend.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.150
Do you have fun when we're together?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.340
I guess, yeah.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.140
Then let's stick together!

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.410
We can travel around and
see the world together!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.300
Don't you ever feel embarrassed
saying that stuff?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.480
I'll be looking for my dad.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.140
You'll be looking for what you want to do.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.110
It'll be a blast!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.840
Yeah.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.690
Doesn't sound too bad.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.500
Okay!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.970
I'll help you look for your dad until
I discover what I want to do!

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.830
Okay!

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.900
Oh, what's your mom doing?

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.790
It's hard asking about my dad,
but asking about my mom is even harder.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.300
Since Mito-san raised me by herself,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.780
it would feel wrong to ask her that...

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.920
Is that how it works?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.650
At first, Mito-san told me

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.430
my parents died in a traffic accident.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.870
She was worried that I
might end up like my dad

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.020
if I learned he was alive and a Hunter...

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.940
And she was right.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
When I found out about my dad,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:56.490
I kind of figured that my
mom was probably dead.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.620
That's pretty harsh!

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.310
So I've always thought of Mito-san as my mom.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.520
She's the only mom I have.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.950
So there's nothing for me to ask.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.510
I don't need to.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.730
I see.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.590
Man,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.780
I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.140
She's the best!

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.980
Though she does nag a lot.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.080
That's nothing...

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.720
My mom starts crying the second
I say I want to go outside!

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.610
She actually goes into hysterics!

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.730
Say...

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.760
What?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.060
How long will you be staying?

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.440
Maybe a month?

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.450
After that...

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.700
I'm going to look for my dad.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.700
What's this?

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.500
Something Ging left with me.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.410
Huh?

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.100
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.070
My dad left this for me...

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.220
I'll tell you

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.230
everything I know about Ging.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.580
Ging is my cousin.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.960
My oldest memory of him is of his back.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.670
I was always running after him.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.170
I think back then, I was three...

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.470
I have the feeling that I was
always looking at his back.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.400
At age twelve, Ging left the
island to take the Hunter Exam,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.230
just like you did.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.770
He suddenly said that
he was leaving the island.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.270
When I asked him why, he told me this...

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.400
"There's something that I want."

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.950
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.590
We argued...

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.160
Actually, it was just me making a fuss.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.550
But I never got to see Ging again
before he left the island.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.170
You were originally told

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.670
that your parents died in a
traffic accident, right?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.180
That was what happened to Mito's parents.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.420
It happened right after Ging left the island.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.620
After that,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.310
Ging's father went missing on a fishing trip.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.570
Both of my sons ended up passing away.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.320
Yes...

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.690
All that happened after he left.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.080
Ten years later, Ging returned to the island.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.220
When he returned, he came carrying you,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.090
and you were still a baby.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.670
He just popped up, out of nowhere.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.260
And he asked us to take care of you.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.630
When I asked about your mother,
he'd only say that they were separated.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:56.060
I was about to agree to look after you,
when I heard a loud,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.650
"Don't be silly!"

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.200
I imagine everyone on the island heard it.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.280
Grandma, you don't need to mention that!

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.700
Anyhow, I knew we couldn't
count on him to raise you.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.850
So we don't know anything
about your mother.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.790
Mito even yelled,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.070
"Don't you ever come back!"
while she cried...

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.170
Grandma!

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.100
Anyway, Ging left this with us then.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.970
This girl's tried to throw it away
so many times...

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:40.110
That's because you always
put it back where it was!

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.040
If you wanted to get rid of it,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.300
you should have buried or burned it,
rather than tossing it in the trash can.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.120
Do you understand?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.810
That's it.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.500
That's all I know about Ging.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.640
Ging...

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.050
Ging, huh?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.050
Ging... Ging...

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.860
Yeah, I'll use that.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.130
Hey, Mito-san...

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.770
Tell me more about

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.890
what Ging was like when he was little!

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.810
Huh?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.460
Does it sound weird for me
to use his name?

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.020
Somehow, it feels more natural.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.790
No, that isn't it.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.940
You want to hear what Ging
was like as a child?

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.040
Yeah!

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.250
Hey, did Ging have any friends his age?

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.610
No, he didn't.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.050
Ging and I were the only children around.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.490
So I always wanted him to play with me,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.890
but he would always run off.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.600
You were always getting lost.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.070
Honestly, you only remember
the embarrassing stuff!

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.030
You followed Ging into the mountains,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.140
but then you didn't come back.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.090
When Ging returned by himself,

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.020
the whole village panicked.
And that happened several times.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.550
But when we went to look
for you in the mountains,

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.300
Ging was always the first to find you.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.590
No matter where you hid...

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.590
After a few times,

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.270
people started wondering if you
two were just playing pranks.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.460
What?!

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.920
I would never do that!

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.660
Well, you always hid in places

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.930
that were impossible to locate.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.880
It was like you didn't want to be found.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.580
Really?

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.020
I guess so...

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.800
Oh, that reminds me of this other time.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.250
Ging and I were...

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.090
Oh?

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.290
I see.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.810
So this is the box.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.040
Huh?

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.150
How do you open it?

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.590
Yeah, I tried a bunch of methods,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.280
but it wouldn't open.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.500
Mind if I use force?

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.810
Go ahead.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.400
Okay...

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.050
It's no use.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.770
This is no ordinary box.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.840
I should be able to twist
open an ordinary steel box.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:19.040
And since we don't know what's inside,
we can't break the box.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.480
It's not making a sound.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.050
Your dad said

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.690
to give this to you once you
became a Hunter, right?

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.450
Yeah, that's what I heard.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.380
Once you became a Hunter...

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.600
I get it...

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.920
I figured it out!

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.860
Gon, there's one thing we haven't tried yet!

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.800
Huh?

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.810
Something you have as a Hunter
that you didn't have before.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.110
Oh, I know!

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.360
My Hunter License!

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.250
But there isn't an opening for the card...

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.220
No, that isn't it.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.600
I meant <i>Nen</i>...

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.500
There's another box inside.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.950
These are just steel plates.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.320
It appears nothing was connecting them.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.630
What's wrong?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.080
Doesn't that design

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.950
look familiar?

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.080
This is...

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.210
I know!

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.300
This is like the pattern on the promise
thread Wing-san gave me.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.760
Wasn't that designed

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.720
to snap if <i>Nen</i> was used?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.020
I bet this pattern holds a
power similar to <i>Nen</i>.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.730
Maybe we're supposed

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.200
to put the card in here now.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.250
It worked!

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.310
Bingo!

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.990
A ring

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.960
and a cassette tape...

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.400
And a memory card?

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.000
Look.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.350
That pattern is on the back of this ring.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.830
You should take care before you put it on.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.090
Really?

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.500
You think that Ging

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.140
might try to hurt me?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.510
Just to be safe.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.480
Well, we can start by listening to the tape.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.800
I guess.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800
Oh, can you copy it?

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.770
Sure, why?

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.700
Just to be safe.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.340
Yo, Gon...

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.640
So you became a Hunter, too.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.360
Anyway, I have a question for you.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.520
Do you want to see me?

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.650
It was the first time Gon had
heard his father's voice.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.070
Ging appeared

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.840
to have read Gon's mind

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.280
when he recorded his question.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:15.960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.290
Today, we introduce Mito-san!

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.400
She raised me.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.780
Raised Gon and has been
waiting on Whale Island

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.820
To me, Mito-san will always be my mom.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.450
for Gon to return.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.440
I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.960
Ging's cousin and
childhood friend.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.270
She's the best,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.510
though she nags a lot!

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.870
Next Time: Reply x From x Dad!

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.120
Earthquake, thunderstorm, fire, or Dad.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.960
Which one scares you most?

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.220
Mito-san.
