WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is a tomb.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.480
Your tomb.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.250
I am very thankful.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.020
Thankful for everything

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360
that has made our meeting possible!

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.020
Zero x And x Rose

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.630
As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.370
the King, his consciousness alone barely following
the afterimages of Netero's movements,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.680
found that a single emotion reigned within him...

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.050
Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.010
That's it.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.550
He brings his hands together to start the attack.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.680
That's the only motion he has
that far surpasses my speed.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.240
Such wasted movement could
cost one's life in battle,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.700
but now, it works as a weapon
that may allow him to defeat me.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.950
Trying to guess what drove
him to do this is pointless.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.460
It would have required choosing
a path that defies reason.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.220
I would presume that, at one point,
he was on the verge of madness...

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.530
Five years... Perhaps ten years...

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.980
And the entire time, he focused on this alone.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.050
I recognize that

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.640
you have dedicated an incredible amount of time

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.350
to achieve the power you have displayed.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.180
After all that, he's barely been scratched.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300
Not that I expected any different.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.170
An individual

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.860
can reach his limit after much training.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.030
You are a rare example of one
who has transcended that limit.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.140
Bravo.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.360
You have earned my praise.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.170
An insect

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.590
should not talk down to humans!

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.890
The King's strategy was quite simple.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.230
Keep attacking.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.080
If the only attack capable of besting him,
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.510
could do next to no damage,
the King had no cause for fear.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.530
These are no more than dummy hands.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.280
They can only move in set patterns.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.590
If I attack from an angle that he can't
block with a move he's already used,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.780
he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.450
Once I have verified all of the combinations,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:03.860
I can find the angle of attack that will
force him to reveal another new move.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.100
However, while he may have a limited
number of attack patterns,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.120
the number of combinations they can
be used in may as well be infinite.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.380
But every individual has a rhythm.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.780
There will be an unconscious bias for,
and against, certain patterns,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.620
and that bias naturally shapes one's identity.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.320
If I can identify his personal rhythm,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.650
I have a fair chance of guessing
which patterns he will select.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.400
To find the single correct needle
among countless millions,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.270
and thread it accurately...

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.560
is what it will take to pierce my target.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.780
It may prove difficult...

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.920
But I will succeed.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.700
I can accomplish it!

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.790
Old soldier, I beg of you...

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.230
Don't lose your life before I succeed!

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.690
He's laughing?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.820
Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.530
No matter my attack trajectory,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.800
he recovers immediately and moves to counter.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.250
If I make a wrong move, his speed won't
allow me time to unleash the next Hand.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:49.010
If I lose focus, he'll tear me
apart before I realize it.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.390
This is a contest of endurance, in which
I must keep choosing correctly...

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.470
When I fail, you win.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.480
That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.160
No matter.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.010
I shall checkmate you shortly.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.160
Checkmate me if you can.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.240
I'll show you my Zero Hand!

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.280
After hundreds and thousands of hits,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:57.330
the King was beginning to feel the slightest
hints of dull pain within his body.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.470
However...

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.570
Stop the bleeding.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.260
Then tell me my name.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.920
You have done well for a human.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.900
What's wrong?

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.030
If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.530
Don't make me laugh.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.050
I'll die?

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.640
You shouldn't get cocky after
landing a lucky punch...

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.300
The battle's just begun!

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.030
You have truly earned my admiration.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.060
I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.290
However, losing your leg was basically inevitable.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.570
It is the consequence of using a defense that,
while not bad, was not the best choice.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.640
After playing against Komugi, I learned
the art of anticipating enemy actions.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.960
Your unconscious bias against certain patterns

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.090
gives me insight into the otherwise
limitless options you have.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.280
Next, I'll take your left arm.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.350
The ensuing fight

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.860
did not even last a minute.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.860
This is

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.060
my life's final act!

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.280
As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.990
heightened his physical and mental senses,

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.170
resulting in an exchange of more
than a thousand punches,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.270
and sparking countless fireworks
between the combatants.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.350
And then, the moment arrived.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.220
His attacks began to show a slight inclination,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.860
one not quite significant enough
to be called a habit or bias.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.490
After using his body to bear the
brunt of Netero's attacks,

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.090
the King was able to find
the faint light beyond, and...

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.550
he reached it.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.400
Are you satisfied now?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.320
Then tell me my name.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.000
Ant King...

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.250
You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.010
A prayer comes from the heart.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.370
If the heart achieves the correct
form, it becomes emotion...

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.940
And emotions may be manifested.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.290
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.150
was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:15.020
gently enveloping the target
with an indiscriminate love.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.560
Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous
intent from a great distance away.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.310
Not this way!

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.750
It had left such a strong impact,
Killua had changed his direction.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.150
The entirety of Netero's aura

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.480
was transformed into a light as
blinding as a star, and fired

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.160
with a merciless roar.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.860
The pinnacle of individual strength.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.980
That was a magnificent attack.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.560
Zero wasn't enough?

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.750
I was born to be King of the Ants,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.330
to rule over all organisms.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.670
I represent the instinctive hope
long nurtured by my species,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.820
and that species continues to evolve for my sake.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:18.790
I stand here now, the resulting boon
of the total support of my species.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.130
You are an individual human, not a king...

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.010
I am the King that bears his kind's fate.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.700
That was the difference in this battle.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:40.570
The Chimera Ants' long evolution
has culminated in me.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.710
This is a feat the human race, with its
individuality, can never match.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.870
However, humans will no longer
be used to propagate our species.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.940
We have learned that

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.220
the strong human ego disrupts
the bonds between Ants.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.230
Out of respect for your efforts,

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.740
I shall allow humans to permanently
survive within a special zone.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:14.240
We shall reevaluate the number and
quality of humans to be used as food.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.000
Your lonely battle was not in vain...

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.400
I shall not repeat myself again.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.260
Tell me my name.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.330
I am not alone.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.540
Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.780
Meruem... That is your name.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.370
As Netero spoke the King's name,

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.660
the King had no time to consider it,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.090
as he watched the old man who was
supposed to be surrendering.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.790
What is this?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.520
Meruem, King of Ants,

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.080
you understand nothing...

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.340
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.790
It was the first time the King had felt fear.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.230
One look at the face of this beaten old man,
who should have been waiting for death,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:20.280
made it clear that his seemingly
vain words were no mere boast.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.380
Should your heart stop beating, this will activate.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.140
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.690
I see now...

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.650
Yes... I see...

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.830
You had me in checkmate

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.480
from the start...

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.180
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.290
while also proving surprisingly lethal.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.020
With the right technology,

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.010
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.450
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.600
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.350
and was popular with small dictatorships.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.170
Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.790
No matter what happens,
I won't betray my friends.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.250
No matter what happens,
I'll believe in my friends.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.630
Thank you, Chairman Netero.
