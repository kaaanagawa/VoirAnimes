WEBVTT

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.410
Ging?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Chairman x And x Release

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.750
Yo.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.970
Ging!

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.030
I'm sorry!

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.510
It was my fault...

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.770
Because of me, Kite

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.020
turned into a little girl!

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.020
I h-heard he was captured by the enemy.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.560
Yeah, I was with Kite...

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.030
Then Kite told me to run away,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.280
and Pitou showed up.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.470
Kite lost his arm, I was knocked out,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.210
and then we trained...

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.750
Shoot got Kite out of the Ants' nest,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.540
but it wasn't Kite...

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.050
They did all kinds of horrible things!

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.210
When I met Pitou again,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.560
Pitou said that Kite was already dead!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.350
Okay, I get it!

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.440
Well, I don't get it, but just have a seat, okay?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.410
U-Uh... Er...

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.680
Let's calm down.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.820
We should both try to calm down...

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.560
It was because I insisted...

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.320
on having my way!

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.650
Oh, um...

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.060
A-A-Anyway...

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.580
Just calm down first.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.520
Ging is...

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.330
Ging is actually flustered.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.370
I should have

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.840
been the one who died!

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.700
Gon.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.710
That isn't true.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.220
He took you along because he believed in you.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.350
He told you to run because he'd
underestimated the enemy.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.950
If he hadn't thought you capable,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.360
he wouldn't have let you accompany
him, no matter what you'd said.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.990
It was his fault that he misjudged the enemy.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.920
But—

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.890
I know.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.470
You're also at fault for being too weak!

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.500
You should feel responsible.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.430
Don't make the same mistake.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.440
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.280
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.640
but either way, you should apologize!

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.150
Yeah.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.890
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.330
Do you know it?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.200
Huh?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.140
No, what is it?

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.170
You promise to do things differently next time.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.150
And you keep that promise, no matter what.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.710
Uh-huh.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.820
Okay, get going!

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.620
Yeah!

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.160
Ging?

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.370
Can I...

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.670
talk to you some more later?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.410
That might be difficult.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.170
I'm a busy man...

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.180
That's crap, Ging!

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.240
Aren't you his father?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.650
How cold can you be?!

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.030
I know about Greed Island!

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.090
You never went to see Gon after he cleared it!

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.440
Too bashful or something?

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.520
All you you, shut up!

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.810
It's none of your business!

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.070
You're a jerk, Ging!

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.460
You should apologize to Gon!

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.710
Promise him you'll act more like a father!

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.370
Hell, you don't have the right
to say you're his father!

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.580
Make up your minds!

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.080
You can all screw yourselves!

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.150
You should have Leorio punch you again!

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.130
Yeah, just shut up!

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.450
Fine, then...

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.960
I'll be waiting, so get going!

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.710
How stupid do you think we are?

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.250
You take him there!

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.350
Aren't you his father?

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.870
Okay, fine!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.600
I'll take you all on!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.600
If you have a problem with
what I'm doing, bring it on!

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.690
You're all against me? Okay!

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.420
That's fine by me!

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.850
Everyone!

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.890
Quiet down!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.620
The election isn't over yet.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.620
Yes, I still haven't given up.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.270
A new last chance has appeared!

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.490
Gon-kun—

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.040
Go ahead, then.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.640
Due to the circumstances, no one
can leave until the election is over.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.440
You're in a hurry, aren't you?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.510
But this will be the final vote.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.900
Once you vote, you'll be allowed to leave.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.620
If you tell us your choice right now,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.400
everyone here will accept that as a valid vote.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.310
Between myself, Pariston, and Leorio-san,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.910
whom do you believe is most
fit to become chairman?

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.550
I should mention that the
former chairman, Netero,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.170
is taking an extended vacation
after defeating the Ant King.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.400
How can you say such a thing?

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.770
If Gon picks Leorio after his dramatic arrival,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.700
everyone may get caught up in
the heat of the moment again

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.100
and vote for Leorio.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.740
Chairman?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.490
Leorio's running for chairman?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.450
No! See, some stuff happened...

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.190
Gon-kun,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.980
you can rely on your gut.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.450
Be true to your heart,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.870
and pick one of us.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.620
Uh... Then,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.850
I'll pick Pariston-san!

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.330
Huh?

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.630
Isn't Leorio-san your friend?

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.010
Shouldn't you pick him?

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.650
Nope, because Leorio wants
to become a doctor,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.100
so he can't be chairman!

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.950
Of course!

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.330
Now I've been completely defeated.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.290
Thank you, Gon-kun.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.660
Then let's begin the vote.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.290
Oh, sorry.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.750
I'm going with Gon.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.220
My vote goes to Pariston.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.590
Leorio...

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.170
I know.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.760
Ging!

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.670
I'm going now!

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.680
Yeah.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.170
Is that all you have to say, you idiot?

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.700
At least say, "See you later"!

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.830
Where's your common sense?

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.180
Ging's snapped!

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.900
Someone stop this negligent jerk of a father!

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.070
Heart Is Valuable

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.480
That's impossible!

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.000
Zodiacs, don't just stand there
and smile! Do something!

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.070
I guess, in his own way, Ging's popular.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.590
Yeah, I guess so...

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.510
Hey, Gon!

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.830
I remembered something.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.280
I'm the one who taught Kite how to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.460
And I taught him his techniques.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.990
There's a number that his
Crazy Slots won't bring up unless

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.220
he's adamant about not dying!

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.380
If he's still alive, that's probably why.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.450
He would never consider dying in your place.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.480
So don't mess up your apology.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.230
Or he'll smack you again!

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.240
Got it!

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.880
I'm off, then!

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.300
Yeah! I'll be waiting!

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.920
Again?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.010
Ging...

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.270
Ninth Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 635
1) Pariston 458 (72.1%)
2) Leorio 157
Turnout: 96.8%  Valid Votes: 615

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.470
Hello, everyone.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.110
I am your 13th chairman, Pariston.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.020
And I have an important announcement.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.450
I, Pariston, name Cheadle-san as vice chairman,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.280
and resign as chairman.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.780
Okay, then.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.450
I didn't see that coming.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.410
How long must you make fools of us?!

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.670
Come back here!

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.930
I didn't become vice chairman because
I wanted to become chairman.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.530
I just wanted to hinder the chairman.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.580
When I said silly things to tease him,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.190
Netero-san always looked so happy...

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.450
I really wanted to play with him some more.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.960
I recommend that you reform the Hunter
Exam and Commandments quickly.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.340
Cheadle-san, if the Association becomes
a dull place under your leadership,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.510
I'll get serious about toying with you.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.830
Leorio, where's Killua?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.620
Huh?

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.400
Oh, I don't know.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.270
He isn't answering his phone.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.720
It sounds like he was traveling,
looking for a way to save you.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.250
Well, once we contact him,
I'm sure he'll come see you.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.440
I need to apologize to Killua.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.260
When I was fighting the enemy, I got confused,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.190
and I said terrible things to him.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.150
I'm sorry, too.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.020
Huh?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.300
Why are you apologizing?

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.150
Well, sorry that I couldn't do anything
when you guys were in trouble.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.190
Huh? What do you mean?

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.660
I don't get it.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.650
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.920
The requests following a wish for a computer

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.190
should be more severe than playing
dead and a pat on the head.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.130
When I heard Milluki's report,
that was the first thing that seemed off.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.780
And when the two-choice wish resulted
in a simple kiss on the cheek,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.510
it demanded fingernails, a far too heavy price.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.470
Assuming that the fingernails were
the price for the computer,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:51.170
Wish                                            Request

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.540
that would match the balance between
wishes and requests seen previously.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.300
If my theory is correct,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.140
playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.540
Thus, the two-choice wish didn't require a payment.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.870
Why was that the case?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.690
There are two possibilities.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.170
One, because the wish was simple enough

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.350
that Something's power wasn't required.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.010
Two,

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.260
because it wasn't a wish.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.330
However, there's still an unresolved question here.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.200
If playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something...

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.600
They were requests from Alluka, not Something.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.080
Killua claims that Something calls him "Killua,"

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.650
and the request to play dead was made to "Brother."

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.920
Thus, the one who calls Killua "Brother" is Alluka.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.710
If the request came from Alluka,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.780
then Something wasn't awake,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.360
and Killua shouldn't have been
able to make the two-choice wish.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.950
However, Something responded to Killua's wish.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.690
The hint to resolving this contradiction
lies in the wording Killua used.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.950
When making the two-choice wish,
Killua was not asking.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.520
He was commanding.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.760
It makes sense that a command
would work differently than a wish,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.220
and would not require a payment upon completion.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.580
Those are my conclusions.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.770
What do you think?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.910
I'll get to the point.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.020
I'm the one who can use Something's power,
effectively and safely, for the Zoldyck family.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.670
As it stands, Alluka is no more than
a spirit locked forever in one room.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.920
But if I control him with you at his side,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.500
at the very least, I can guarantee his freedom.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.560
Brother...

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.840
I'll protect Alluka.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.280
Kil, you need to learn your place.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.610
Something, wake up.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.270
'Kay.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.110
Kil, this is your last chance.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.130
Let me have Something—

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.130
Something!

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.130
Send Illumi back home!

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.630
'Kay.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.990
Teleportation...

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.270
For real?

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.330
Oh, you were all watching?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.700
That's amazing... He's invincible.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.280
If Killua issues a command,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.010
there is no need to worry about requests.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.440
This means that turning Killua into
my puppet is worth any price.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.090
Tsubone, Amane...

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.440
Can you leave us alone for a moment?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.430
If you don't leave on your own,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.200
I'll have to issue Something a command.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.440
Killua, pat my head...

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.850
Something is doing this because
she wants me to praise her.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.780
I don't want to use her by issuing commands.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.470
So please...

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.820
Killua...

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.210
Killua!

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.830
Killua!

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.940
Killua...

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.220
Something...

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.990
Killua, pat my head.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.380
You can't come out anymore.

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.270
I love Killua.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.280
You can't come out, Something.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.480
I love Killua.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.660
I love Killua!

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.620
You can't!

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.670
Never come out again!

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.630
Got it?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.050
'Kay...

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.680
Alluka is free now.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.010
I'm sorry.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.250
I'm sorry, Something.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.120
I'm sorry...

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.280
Alluka?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.430
Brother?

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.850
Yep, it's your big—

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.060
Did you make Something cry?

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.960
Huh?

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.820
Er, well...

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.320
She's still hunched over, crying!

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.270
Apologize to her!

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.340
But...

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.700
Apologize!

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.220
If you're nice to me, you have to
be nice to Something, too!

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.590
If you're going to protect me,
you have to protect Something, too!

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.070
If you're mean to Something, I'll hate you!

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.320
Alluka, thank you.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.280
I guess I was still under Ill-nii's control.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.810
But everything's okay now.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.500
Can you tell Something to come out?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.650
Something, I'm sorry.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.660
I was wrong.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.240
I'm sorry!

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.780
I was scared of Ill-nii,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.130
and I couldn't defy him.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.690
So I did what he said, and I hated it.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.710
When I realized he might force you

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.720
to do bad things, too, I got really scared...

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.290
For Alluka's sake, I lied to myself,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.800
and I said mean things to you.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.350
I'm really sorry!

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.180
Something,

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.900
I'll protect you.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.260
We'll always be together!

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.330
Don't listen to wishes from anyone else anymore!

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.010
I'll pat you on the head whenever you want!

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:59.390
So would you please come out again?

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.210
'Kay...

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.220
Something,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.830
will you forgive me for being a

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.100
bad big brother?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.010
'Kay.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.990
I...

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.240
love Killua.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.000
Tsubone, I've rescinded the restriction on Killua.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.790
Please let him know.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.600
Yes, I understand.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.170
His first friend.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.050
Too many memories to speak of.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.640
A new journey.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.760
Next time: Salvation x And x Future.
