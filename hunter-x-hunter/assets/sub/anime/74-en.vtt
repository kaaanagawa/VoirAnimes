WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.120
I must crush his will.

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.970
His will to fight, his will to stand,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.440
his will to resist...

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.710
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.040
Victor x And x Loser

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.640
He's fast...

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.390
I had no time to dodge!

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.670
But I can still block his attacks!

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690
<i>Oh? He used </i>Gyo?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.600
The moment I grasped his arm,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.450
he focused his aura there to block my attack.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.050
Idiot!

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.080
You think you've outwitted me now?!

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.920
What's the matter?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.970
That was just a body blow.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.170
If you focus your aura where I grab you,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.970
you leave yourself open everywhere else.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.300
It's futile...

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.250
In fact, you're only making
it harder on yourself.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.110
Bisky was right!

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.740
You won't be smiling much longer!

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.400
One more hit to send you to hell!

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.490
Impossible!

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.180
That was the hardest hit so far!

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.920
He shouldn't have been able to counter.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.680
But since he did, that means he
kept the damage to a minimum.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.730
In other words, he blocked me
without relying on aura.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.250
He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.770
No, that wasn't a guess.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.490
Hey, Bisky...

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.030
How does Genthru avoid being
burned by his own bombs?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.580
That's quite simple.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.700
He shrouds his hand in aura that's
stronger than the explosion.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.290
Oh... I get it.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.290
It's a technique that requires
a large aura reserve.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.530
This is a good opportunity.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.300
By now, you should be able to tell.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.600
Excellent reaction!

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.790
<i>You've almost perfected </i>Gyo.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.560
One more time, then.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.760
Huh?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.250
Could you tell the difference?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.040
Yeah, you used less aura the second time.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.330
Okay, you pass.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.820
You'll have an easier time with him
if you can tell the difference.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.130
<i>When Genthru prepares Little Flower,
he will shroud his hand with </i>Gyo.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.780
If he's just faking and planning
to attack you somewhere else,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.970
<i>he probably won't use</i> Gyo.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.050
<i>If you can tell if his hand is covered
with</i> Gyo <i>when he grabs you,</i>

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.840
it'll be simpler for you to know
which attack you should block.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.220
So that's it.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.560
You knew from my <i>Gyo</i>.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.850
Cunning.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.350
Let me repeat myself.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.640
The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.450
If you're caught by Little Flower when
you aren't using enough aura to defend,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.870
a hit to the face will blow off your eyes,
nose, and mouth with no hope of repair.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.760
A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin,
severely damaging any nerves or muscle.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.780
You'll have no fingers or toes left.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.510
It's not possible for you to use <i>Gyo</i> to guard
against every attack that uses <i>Gyo</i>.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.130
Now what?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.850
I'm not interested in continuing this.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.270
Fighting you has made me see something...

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.810
You have talent and a promising future.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.520
And many other chances.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.000
Don't you think it's meaningless to throw
all that away just for your pride?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.530
Just give up, stupid kid!

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.830
If he makes like he's going to use
both hands to blow you up,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.390
that's a red light.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.410
Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.920
Sorry, Bisky and Killua.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.140
I'm gonna be selfish here.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.280
I have to give it a try...

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.490
Because I just had a great idea!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.430
If you seriously mean that,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.810
you should surrender, Genthru!

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.720
A shame...

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.820
Let me show you

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.240
that there are some things worse than death.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.280
I'll blow up both your arms.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.260
Use <i>Gyo</i> to protect the one you want to keep.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.580
After that, I'll blow up your
remaining arm and left leg.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.020
Use <i>Gyo</i> to protect the one you want to keep.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.590
And so on...

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.980
Until you're out of limbs.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.930
Go ahead and try!

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.520
Very well.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.180
Take this!

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.510
Wh-What happened?

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.490
Blood?

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.390
Damage?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.680
He landed a hit?

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.930
First comes rock!

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.880
Crap...

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.260
Move... Dodge!

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.380
Rock...

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.880
Paper...

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.210
Rock!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.480
Did he hit me?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.950
No, I tripped.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.030
What was that?

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.460
What just happened?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.780
Now I understand...

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.870
Th-This kid...

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.180
He sacrificed both hands!

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.830
But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.820
He probably gave up completely on his left hand,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.860
protected his right hand with 30% of his aura,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.520
and focused the remaining 70% on his legs...

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.030
to attack me!

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.900
I use aura both to explode targets and
to shield my hand from the blast.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.000
If I use it on both hands,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.080
I won't have much left for the rest of myself.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.490
He took advantage of that!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.120
Still, no one sane would actually try that!

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.130
I gave him a pretty good scare!

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.940
Damn...

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.030
This hurts like hell.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.480
But...

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.630
I'm going for it!

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.630
I'm done...

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.800
He's done?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.890
Is he giving up?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.950
Of course...

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.640
That makes sense.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.720
He's lost his left hand,
and his right is badly injured.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.050
And he managed to land a hit on me.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.520
He must be satisfied now.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.030
I'm done being selfish...

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.900
Time to get serious!

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.780
Let's do this, Genthru!

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.290
Th-This kid's

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.620
totally insane!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.440
Book!

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.320
A card?

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.860
He shouldn't have anything to concern me.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.200
The card transformed?

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.090
Paladin's Necklace?!

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.270
What is he planning?

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.400
This is your last chance to surrender.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.810
Once I use this, you could end up dead.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.150
You're clearly bluffing!

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.910
Now wait...

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.660
This is my chance.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.950
Book.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.120
I give up.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.160
Obviously, you're never going to surrender.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.670
Take them.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.600
I'll silence him.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.420
Crushing his windpipe and
knocking him out would be best.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.180
Then I can take the cards from his binder.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.440
I have one request.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.660
What is it?

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.780
Could you leave me this card?

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.690
Bah...

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.440
He blocked my second attack with </i>Gyo<i>!

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.080
But I did manage to crush his windpipe!

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.010
He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.570
Genthru...

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.080
You have made the worst mistake you could make.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.830
Gasoline
A glass container
filled with fuel.
Highly flammable.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.580
One minute!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.090
What's that smell?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.850
He can't use Little Flower any longer.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.600
I'm going to take him down!

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.430
Book.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.330
Oh, so this is gasoline...

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.610
Very clever.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.900
True, I cannot use Little Flower now...

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.360
However, I have another ability,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.990
Countdown.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.830
The ability that lets me set a bomb

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.500
when I touch someone and say "Bomber."

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.990
The bomb can only be disarmed
by touching me and saying,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.500
"I caught the Bomber."

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.160
This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.100
You won't be able to block it with <i>Nen</i>.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.450
All the activation requirements have been met.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.520
If I touch you and say, "Bomber,"
the countdown will begin.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.920
Try to run away...

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.020
If you still have the strength.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.650
The requirements have been met... for me!

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.160
First comes rock...

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.580
This is his earlier attack...

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.660
If get too close, I'm done for.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.910
Is he trying to keep me back?

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.330
Rock...

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.800
Paper...

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.530
Rock!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.760
A pitfall?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.850
But he's falling with me!

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.860
It's deep...

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.750
I can't climb back up.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.880
But he should be in the same boat.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.370
He's ended up cornering himself.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.000
He's gone.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.730
Genthru...

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.380
If a card is removed from
the binder for a minute,

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.860
it reverts to an item.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.560
Large Rock

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.890
A rock?!

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.930
First comes rock...

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.780
Rock...

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.920
Paper...

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.760
W-W-Wait!

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.510
I surrender! I surrender!

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.590
Rock!

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.320
Osu!

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.700
Are you awake?

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.410
Summon your binder.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.150
We want you to return the cards you stole

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.160
from the people you backstabbed.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.840
On one condition...

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.840
Use Archangel to heal Bara.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.820
We have a Clone card.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.720
Don't worry.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.340
That was always part of the plan.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.610
We brought six copies of Clone.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.240
Book...

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.840
Gain!

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.880
What is your wish?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.630
We need you to heal his hands and throat.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.640
Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.970
Easily done.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.890
Then I shall heal his body.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.250
I'm healed!

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.920
Then, farewell.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.860
All right!

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.540
Okay, here's the extra Archangel.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.960
Gain!

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.670
Next up is Killua.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.650
Genthru, we're going to use your binder.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.560
Go ahead.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.640
Clone on!

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.510
Breath of Archangel has reached
its maximum card limit.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.200
Clone will be destroyed.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.290
W-W-Wait!

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.420
What's going on?!

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.960
Did I do something wrong?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.790
No, it's Goreinu.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.450
Huh?

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.270
He used Clone or Transform to increase the
number of Breath of Archangel vouchers.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.960
So two of his vouchers became
Breath of Archangel cards.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.290
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.660
Yo, it's Goreinu.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.980
Looks like you won.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.480
But I don't approve of this.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.770
If you plan to use Breath of Archangel
to heal these murderers,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.230
the trade is off!

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.890
You okay with using it on me?

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.090
Of course.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.610
I am an assassin.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.550
Eh?

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.870
I've killed more people than these guys.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.670
Each player in this game risks their
life in one way or another.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.480
That doesn't make it okay to kill others.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.870
But all the people I've killed were
not nearly as prepared to die.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.510
I'm worse than these guys.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.810
No, you aren't like them.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.800
I like you, but I hate their guts!

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.670
That isn't a valid reason!

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.910
I don't need a reason...

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.270
What counts is how I feel.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.480
Aren't you guys the same way?

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.770
But we don't think it's right

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.130
to let them die because we hate them.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.630
In battle, both sides risk their lives,

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.240
and are prepared to kill.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.660
But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.040
I haven't forgiven Genthru for
killing all those players...

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.900
But the three of us agreed before the fight

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.430
that we'd bring six Clone cards.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.550
I don't really remember why we decided that,

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.810
but it wasn't based on logic or reason.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.060
It was just the decision that came naturally to us.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.160
Once the fight was over and we'd
obtained Breath of Archangel,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.570
we planned to heal everyone.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.710
All three of us made the decision,
so we wanted to stick to it.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.830
But I understand how you feel,
and we can't change your mind.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.700
Sorry, Killua...

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.250
Could you wait a little longer?

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.050
No problem.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.080
I'll recover on my own in a while.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.330
The situation's changed, so we
can't use Clone anymore.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.030
There's only one Breath of Archangel left.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.720
Only one? Isn't that the original?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.600
Use it on Genthru.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.170
I'm fine...

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.860
Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.210
Yeah.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.740
Hey, wait up...

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.250
Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.220
Huh?

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.210
Really? Are you sure?

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.600
Yeah, actually...

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.300
Before you told me all this,
I planned to give it to you.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.630
Not just Archangel, but all of our cards.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.680
What?!

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.390
Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.700
We've decided to give up on the game.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.900
Wow, I'm completely healed!

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.820
Oh, so Mr. Battera...

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.900
Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his
team for breaking his promise.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.770
I got four billion out of it.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:37.910
Four billion?!

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.850
Hey...

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.390
Share some of the wealth!

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.920
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.920
Each of the four of us gets one billion!

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.500
Eh?!

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.290
It's only fair...

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.910
I couldn't have done this on my own.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.550
It was only possible because
I teamed up with you guys.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.440
I can't believe it...

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.800
You're such a nice guy!

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.310
Anyway, you can take all the cards.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.930
On one condition!

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.210
You must be the first players to beat the game.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.030
Yep!

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.940
Not a problem.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.270
That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.200
Leaving only #0.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.020
One card to go...

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.330
Yeah.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.170
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight...

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.190
And this is...

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.340
Maid Panda
A species on the
verge of extinction.
Tidy, loves to cook,
and some individuals
enjoy Western clothing
and gardening.
Excellent at taking
care of human children.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.340
ninety-nine!

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.590
This announcement is for all players.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.480
A player has collected ninety-nine
restricted slot cards.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.660
Ten minutes from now, in honor of this event,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:57.610
there will be a quiz contest
for all <i>Greed Island</i> players.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.560
There will be one hundred total questions

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.620
dealing with restricted slot cards.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.370
The player who has the most
correct answers will receive

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.630
#0 Ruler's Blessing as a prize.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.750
Please wait with your binders open.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.440
Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.880
I get it.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.530
The questions are probably
designed so that players

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.020
who mainly stole cards can't answer them.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.370
Someone's coming!

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.880
Wait, more over here!

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.640
The long battle has finally
reached its final stage.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:03.990
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.840
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.900
Today, we introduce the card Transform.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:10.740
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.680
You can change one card into any other card.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.790
Gon, quick!

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.180
<i>Transform on!</i> Gold Dust Girl.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.290
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net 500G.
Very shy and quiet.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.710
Gain.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.870
G.I. Tutorial

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.430
Next time: Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.580
Think I can make a hundred friends?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.470
You'll be fine.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.200
If your eyes meet, you're friends.
