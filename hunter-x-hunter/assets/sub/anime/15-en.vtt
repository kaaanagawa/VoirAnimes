00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.930
<i>Now!</i>

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.730
I did it!

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.930
<i>I figured it out!</i>

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.780
<i>I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!</i>

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.410
Explosion x Of x Deception

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.120
Zevil Island, day two.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.800
Gon has learned the technique

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.390
which will enable him to
capture his target.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.040
Ow!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.800
My hands are all bloody...

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.560
I've been swinging my fishing
rod for two straight days.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.980
<i>But now, I have perfect accuracy,</i>

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.530
<i>catching birds as they swoop
after their prey.</i>

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.600
<i>If I utilize this technique properly,</i>

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.780
<i>I'll be able to steal Hisoka's tag.</i>

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.030
<i>All that's left is to find Hisoka!</i>

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.040
Ow...

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.330
But how am I supposed to find Hisoka?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.980
I guess I'll just have to walk around,
and trust my instincts.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.780
What?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.560
Why are they gathering around me?

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.070
<i>These butterflies...</i>

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.570
<i>They're attracted to the scent of blood.</i>

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.750
Hisoka,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.470
have you taken your target's tag?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.590
No, not yet.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.590
You don't even know who
your target is, do you?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.690
No.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.100
Want me to tell you?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.100
No, it doesn't matter.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.110
I'll just find three others to hunt.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.870
<i>I remember that, back at the tower,
Hisoka was injured.</i>

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.380
<i>If this works, the butterflies
might lead me to him.</i>

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.390
Ah...

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.320
It's the guy who was grazed
by the arrow.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.820
Better luck next year!

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.080
<i>There he is!</i>

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.140
<i>Stay calm...</i>

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.850
<i>Stay calm!</i>

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.670
<i>I just need to wait.</i>

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.900
<i>For Hisoka to make his move.</i>

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.120
Man, where is everyone hiding?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.130
I haven't seen anyone for
the past two days.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.140
Who's there?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.970
Oh, hold on!

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.350
It's just me...

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.350
Tonpa!

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.810
Don't tell me that your target is...

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.990
Hey, wait a second!

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.480
Just calm down.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.250
You aren't my target.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.680
Prove it.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.480
Right...

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.130
Here.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.020
Good thing I didn't throw it away.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.170
Fighting people who aren't my target

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.560
is a waste of time and energy.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.260
Don't tell me that I'm your target!

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.320
Unfortunately, you're not.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.010
#246.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.190
Ponzu, huh?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.900
Huh?

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.030
You know who this is?

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.830
You didn't already know?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.890
Uh, er, well...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.040
I wouldn't put it that way.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.770
I just didn't have a chance
to find out...

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.880
Heh.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.530
Want me to fill you in?

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.740
What?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.460
Your target's appearance, weapons,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.550
special abilities, and weaknesses.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.590
However, I have one condition.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.650
Huh?

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.820
I think I ate some bad fruit.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.380
Bad fruit...

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.620
To be honest, I can barely stand...

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.590
You want to become a doctor, right?

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.090
Do you have any medicine on you?

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.350
I got it...

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.270
Don't soil yourself.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.020
I have all kinds of anti-diarrheal
and stomach medicine.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.150
Oh...

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.640
Thank you so much!

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.530
First, tell me what you know.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.530
F-Fine...

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.300
Ponzu is a female applicant.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.540
Female?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.650
As far as I know,

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.050
five of the remaining
twenty-four applicants

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.380
use some sort of chemical weapon.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.550
Ponzu is one of those.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.300
So she's the one.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.140
This girl happens to

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.990
specialize in all kinds of drugs.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.250
But her strategy is simple...

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.060
Hide and wait.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.000
Hide and wait?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.140
She sets a trap and waits for
her target to show up.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.710
I see...

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.300
You shouldn't have to worry
about anything else.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.410
If you make it a close-quarters fight,
you're guaranteed to win.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.060
If you find her,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.420
watch your footing, and note which
direction the wind is blowing.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.500
Sh-She's fully aware that
someone else

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.640
is targeting her.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.380
Th-That's pretty much it.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.550
G-Give me the medicine...

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.430
Okay.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.930
To be safe, back up a bit.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.440
H-Hurry...

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.940
I-I can't hold it in!

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.570
<i>Damn!</i>

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.630
Your tag is mine.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.750
I knew you were keeping your
tag in your suitcase.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.500
Tonpa!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.440
You two are working together?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.010
Exactly so.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.380
I didn't need your medicine.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.010
I have my own.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.680
And I might as well confess

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.530
that you actually are my target.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.160
Wh-What about the card you
just showed me?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.590
That's my target.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.520
This is Tonpa's.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.140
We swapped cards.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.530
And you fell for our little trick...

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.150
There you have it.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.660
Damn you!

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.620
I'll make you pay!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.910
Uh-oh...

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.810
Tonpa!

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.450
We'll meet at the usual place!

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.570
Gotcha!

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.580
Hold up!

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.180
I'm gonna kill you!

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.460
Hey, now...

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.270
I'm not the one with your tag!

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.020
Shut up!

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.260
Good grief...

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.440
You still haven't learned
your lesson, rookie?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.730
What was that?

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.900
It's your own fault for letting us trick you!

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.400
Besides,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.910
working in teams during the
Hunter Exam is common sense!

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.530
I agree with the latter,
but I cannot accept the former.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.040
Huh?

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.440
You shouldn't be tricking people,
in the first place!

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.800
Kurapika...

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.050
Leorio, want to team up?

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:47.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.140
Target

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.910
Please Do Not Feed!!

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.920
Hey!

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.420
Return my tag!

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.130
If you want it back, catch me.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.190
Okay!

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.590
I retrieved my tag.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.700
And we have the tags for
#16 and #118, as well.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.010
So, Kurapika,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.600
Tonpa was your target?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.270
You saved me back there.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.010
You needn't thank me.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.670
I didn't want Tonpa to notice me,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.280
so I stayed hidden

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.210
while you were jumped from behind.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.280
What?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.530
Well, that was because

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.360
I figured there'd be no point in teaming up

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.220
with you if you couldn't
withstand that attack.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.460
I suppose that you barely qualified.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.730
You really are full of yourself...

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.090
Well,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.170
I can't deny that it's easier
to work as a team.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.230
Let's stick together for the
remaining four days.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.230
Yes.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.450
You got your target's tag.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.850
So with your own, that adds
up to six points.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.520
Assuming he doesn't take it back.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.820
The #118 tag is only worth
one point for either of us.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.500
But it might still come in handy.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.390
Next, we need to find your target,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.760
#246, Ponzu.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.260
Stay alert, in case we're being followed.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.280
You shouldn't be talking.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.170
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.270
You're absolutely right.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.250
I know you've been following me
since the exam began.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.020
You fail at hiding.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.850
Show yourself.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.810
Let's play.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.100
Well, come on out.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.100
I know you're there.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.600
<i>He noticed me?</i>

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.860
If you won't come out, I'll come to you.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.490
<i>I guess that's it...</i>

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.000
<i>In that case, it's all or nothing.</i>

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.510
<i>When did he arrive?</i>

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.390
I challenge you to a duel.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.900
You'll die.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.410
<i>This is my chance!</i>

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.420
<i>My chance is about to come...</i>

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.930
<i>In the moment Hisoka goes
to finish off his prey!</i>

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.980
<i>Why?</i>

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.410
<i>Why isn't Hisoka fighting back?</i>

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.750
Hisoka, explain yourself...

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.750
Why won't you attack me?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.780
If I continue to avoid your attacks,

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.010
you'll die eventually.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.570
I can tell from the swarm of
Hemotropic Butterflies

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.310
that your wounds are grave.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.520
Someone else has already dealt
you a fatal blow, yes?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.870
Though I do understand your
desire to die in battle.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.880
If you...

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.780
If you understand so well,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.080
why do you still refuse to fight me?!

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.700
I have no interest in the dead.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.080
What?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.930
I'm not yet...

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.430
You're already dead.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.800
It's in your eyes.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.060
Bye-bye.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840
Sorry about that.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.680
I carelessly let him escape.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.340
Liar.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.120
He probably begged you to grant him

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.740
one final wish, yes?

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.850
Well, I felt sorry for the guy.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.820
Given that he was dead either way.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.500
You should cease pitying enemies
who serve no purpose.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.080
You've done it before, haven't you?

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.860
You've walked away from opponents
before finishing them.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.230
I have standards.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.870
I'm not interested in people
who have no purpose.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.870
I only spare those whose deaths
would go to waste.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.330
What about his tag?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.460
Oh, I already took it.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.850
I have six points now,
so I don't need this one.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.090
You can have it.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.100
Whose tag is this?

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.930
It belonged to some guy
who tried to snipe me.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.700
He ticked me off, so I killed him.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.240
Well, then...

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.380
This is always so fascinating to watch.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.880
It's pretty hard on me...

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.140
I feel much better.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.750
Well, I'll just sleep here
until the final day.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.990
Good luck.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.930
It's completely dark now.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.280
Keep your guard up.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.280
Night provides the perfect chance for
someone to attack their target.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.940
I know that.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.940
Well, I need two more points.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.700
I suppose I should go hunt someone...

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.180
I'll get him this time!

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.240
Found you...

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.740
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.000
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.280
Four days remain before the
exam's Fourth Phase ends.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.100
Next time: Defeat x And x Disgrace!

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.670
Let's shake hands!

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.760
With a firm grip.
