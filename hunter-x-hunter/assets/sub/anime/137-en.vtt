00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
Chairman Netero gathered the top
leaders of the Hunter Association,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.470
the Zodiacs, for the purpose of
electing the next chairman.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.850
The Zodiacs...

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.730
Twelve Hunters whose abilities
the chairman had recognized.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.750
In emergencies, he entrusted
them with leading the Association.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.250
When nothing was happening, they
accompanied him in leisure activities.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500
Each Zodiac is assigned a code name...

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.650
And most members, out of
adoration for the chairman,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.270
made moving efforts to embody their code names,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.510
such as changing their names or personas.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.010
However, there are exceptions.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.020
Debate X Among X Zodiacs

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.020
Chairman!

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.470
Mizaistom (Ox)

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.490
I thought we had all the Zodiacs present,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.270
but the Rat is missing.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.730
Piyon (Rabbit)

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.420
The Vice Chairman is very busy,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.150
even at a time like this.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.690
Geru (Snake)

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.410
It's because it is a time like this.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.290
He's scrambling to secure votes for himself, I'm sure.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.640
Ginta (Sheep)

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.830
Chairman!

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.250
Ginta... You're loud, annoying, and you smell!

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.250
Cluck (Chicken)

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.740
Saiyu (Monkey)

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.660
Even the habitual slacker Ging showed up!

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.760
Guess the Rat's just a scumbag.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.210
Ging (Boar)

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.900
What do you mean, "even" I showed up?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300
I'll kill you, monkey.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.640
Go ahead and try it, dumbass.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.130
Botobai (Dragon)

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.830
I can't accept this.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.020
Why didn't the chairman call us to help?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.470
Kanzai (Tiger)

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.840
Agreed.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.170
Morel and Knov were above that kind of job!

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.520
"Above" is not the word you're looking for.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.100
Cheadle (Dog)

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.150
You wanted to hunt the Ants yourself, did you not?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.520
The chairman wanted all of us together for this.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.150
Saccho (Horse)

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.530
Let's wait for him to arrive.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.430
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.030
Pariston (Rat)

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.040
My apologies!

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.600
Everyone is in a frenzy over what's
going on with East Gorteau.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.180
It's a big problem.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.760
Just sit down.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.250
Oh, sorry about that.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.860
Then let's begin this meeting on the
election of the next chairman.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.270
Hold on!

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.690
Why are you leading the meeting?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.940
Huh? Is there a problem?

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.440
Don't boss us around after you showed up late.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.760
Pariston, you're irritating!
You're a creep! Get lost!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.670
Well, I wasn't sure if I should take the lead.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.330
But you know, I'm the Vice Chairman.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.930
I outrank the rest of you, and I'm
good at coordinating these things.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.650
I'm sure you all want to finish this quickly.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.960
That's why.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.960
If we rank by age, Botobai-san should lead.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.470
Judging by ability to foster progress,
Cheadle-san should lead.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.820
Both are better suited to the task than I.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.470
Would one of you be willing to take over?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.980
I'll refrain. You'd probably give me a hard time.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.980
I concur.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.670
Forget it. Just lead the meeting.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.240
Just come out and say you
want to do it, scumbag.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.170
In that case, if anyone objects
to me leading this meeting,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.910
raise your hand.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.600
I object! I object! I seriously object!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.640
I see four objections...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.950
The majority says I should continue.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.870
Of course, we can discuss any
complaints as they arise.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.920
I'm ready to step down anytime.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.020
Then, I have a proposal.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.890
I will run for the position of chairman,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.270
so let's not bother with an election.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.620
I'm gonna kill you, brat!

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.210
Scary... Everyone calm down.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.530
My point is that we'll waste time and money.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.540
We already know the results.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.960
No one here will vote for you.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.290
That's eleven votes.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.340
Together, you can only muster eleven votes.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.800
Do you know how many Hunters
are in the Association?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.440
The late Chairman Netero was too strong...

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.930
So he couldn't understand
the feelings of the weak.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.430
The same can be said for all of you.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.060
However, I can understand the weak!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.320
That is the kind of Chairman I seek to be!

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.130
The weak end up as your slaves,
working under the name of intermediaries.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.330
How much have you made off
them, Prince of Kickbacks?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.740
Please, you have it wrong. I'm asking
them to contribute to the pool.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.330
It's meant to help the Association expand.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.530
Eighteen people.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.640
Do you know what that number represents?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.010
The number of Hunters who've
gone missing in the three years

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.630
since you became Vice Chairman.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.450
As professionals who risk our lives,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.270
we're obligated to be aware of the
situations our trusted associates are in.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.480
A missing Hunter is more bizarre than
a Hunter's unexpected death.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.120
Before you became Vice Chairman, the
average was 0.6 Hunters missing per year.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.240
It's increased tenfold.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.750
Do you have anything to say?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.250
That number is tragic... It pains me greatly.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.310
Once I become Chairman,
the number will surely decrease!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.430
I'll run for Chairman.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.530
I'm going to carry on the old man's will.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.190
Don't want to vote for either of them!

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.820
Ging-san, I hear something
happened to your son...

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.920
Sounds like it.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.890
Should I visit him?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.210
Sure, he'd probably be thrilled.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.580
Would he even realize I was there?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.230
I heard he's in critical condition.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.320
Maybe I shouldn't go after all...

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.810
If he dies after I do, I'll have wasted my time.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.080
Go visit him.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.340
He isn't going to die.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.570
Uh, can I ask a question?

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.980
First, shouldn't we reevaluate
the process for running?

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.480
You're the one who started it!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.490
What's wrong with your head?!

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.280
I only offered to serve in hopes
of saving us money and time.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.620
If we can't avoid the process,
let's first decide how to go about it.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.370
There we go!

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.380
When he controls the pace,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.250
everything becomes more complicated.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.510
In that case, we can draw lots.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.960
Screw that!

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.260
How can we have our leader chosen by chance?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.510
Are you a scumbag, too?

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.520
I'll give a sheet of paper to each of you.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.140
Hey...

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:24.060
I want each of you to write what you believe to be the optimal election process,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.650
with the prerequisite of achieving
at least 95% voter turnout.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.410
And a third party will pick one
of the proposals at random.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.420
A third party?

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.910
I'm guessing she means Beans.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.330
Each proposal has a 1 in 12 chance.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.040
So there won't be any hard feelings.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.210
That's true...

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.830
Not a bad idea.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.170
That's fine, since I won't lose.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.310
But we should write down our names,
so we know whose idea is chosen.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.480
She said the odds are 1 in 12, but that isn't true.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.980
If the ten of us write something
that puts Pariston...

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.510
and Ging, if possible...

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.490
at a disadvantage, our odds will be 5 in 6.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.080
If we record how each person votes,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.870
Pariston will have an advantage.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.480
Should we use anonymous ballots to allow
for dividing points among candidates?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.590
Would our intermediaries then
betray us with no guilt or fear?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.300
So here we are, Beans-san.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.650
There are twelve sheets of paper inside.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.660
Please pick one.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.310
It will determine the rules
we will use for the election.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.210
You want me to pick one?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.670
This is an important task.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.260
Then I will draw one.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.090
The chosen proposal is Ging-san's.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.730
Ging's rules...

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.990
He's no Pariston, but he's still trouble.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.890
Rule #1.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.500
"All Hunters are both candidates and voters."

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.050
Rule #2.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:53.010
"If the winner of the first election fails
to receive a majority of votes,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.120
the top sixteen will have a runoff.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.090
If a majority is still not achieved, there will
be another runoff with half the candidates."

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.580
Rule #3.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.520
"If the turnout for any given vote is under
95%, that vote must be redone."

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.180
Rule #4.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.780
"Voters must write their name on the ballot.
Anonymous votes will be invalid."

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.450
What are you thinking?!

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.910
Why force people to sign them?

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.100
Are you an idiot? A total idiot?!

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.640
You are the idiots.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.690
When everyone knows who voted for whom,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.670
it's a lot more entertaining.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.440
There's his problem...

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.560
He only cares about having fun!

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.370
Rule #5.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.550
There's more?!

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.440
"The election committee chairman
will be Ging Freecss."

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.600
I didn't think of that!

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.730
I didn't include such a rule...

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.650
That was a mistake.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.900
I was too focused on the actual rules.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.100
This is what Ging really wanted.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.930
Now he can control the election as he pleases.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.270
May I say something?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.480
This drawing was to determine how the
election would be conducted, correct?

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.070
Rules one through four are fine,

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.680
but the chairman should be chosen separately.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.460
I can live with that.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.430
You can?

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.600
This is a Hunter.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.640
Frightening...

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.320
Two Days Ago

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.110
Ging-san!

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.330
Yo.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.140
What brings you here so early?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.200
I'm surprised you actually came.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.330
Yeah, I happened to be in the area.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.700
That can't be true...

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.280
Thank you very much.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.490
I saw the old man's video.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.220
Oh, that pen and notepad...

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.260
Huh?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.510
Can you leave one by the phone
in the conference room?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.610
Oh, there should already be one.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.890
Oh, never mind, then.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.660
Is there also a trashcan like this one?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.490
Yes.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.290
Why do you ask?

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.870
Four...

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.120
No, eight.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.260
Read this.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.110
These are rules for the election, yes?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.450
Yeah.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.590
What is this for?

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.980
In a few days, the Zodiacs will gather here.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.570
Most likely, there will be a drawing.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.190
Why would you say that?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.560
If we tried to hold a vote or come to a
consensus, it would take too long.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.270
Plus, Pariston will be there...

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.430
As far as he's concerned,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.510
1 in 12 odds would be acceptable,
as long as it might give him an advantage.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.280
Either way, it's a win for him.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.300
And everyone else will think
their odds are 5 in 6...

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.530
That basically guarantees a drawing.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.920
I expect Cheadle will propose it.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.450
Saccho may protest.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.140
Piyon would be a long shot.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.560
Kanzai would be a really long shot...

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.810
And they'll ask me to hold the drawing?

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.290
There's no one else.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.360
Everyone else in this building supports Pariston.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.410
If these rules look acceptable, fold it three
times, and keep it until the meeting.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.180
If they don't ask for you or if
I fold my paper differently,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.230
I'll look at the floor, and you should
burn that piece of paper.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:55.210
In my opinion, if you're willing
to become Chairman...

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.910
No, that won't happen.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.360
Zero chance.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.380
Sorry.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.860
I'm not doing this because I
want to change the result.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.770
All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.350
I'm not looking for any trouble.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.860
But what about Rule #5?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.380
That's a decoy.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.480
If I leave that as Rule #5, it'll give people pause.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.680
And if I agree to concede that rule,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.110
they'll be more ready to accept the rest.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.170
This is how criminals con people.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.620
It's nothing special.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.150
If Rule #5 passes, I'll resign.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.500
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.320
to change the result?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.000
That's a strange question to ask.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.590
If I can get my target to move as I want,

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.630
I've succeeded as a Hunter.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.050
I just want to enjoy the process.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.420
That's all.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.150
The election committee was composed
of the twelve Zodiacs.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.660
Cluck, one of the Zodiacs,
sent ballots to every Hunter.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.250
The election for the 13th Chairman...

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.610
The Hunter Association has 661 members.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.930
Which means that is the number of candidates.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.420
Each Hunter must bring their own ballot.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.350
Ballots may only be entered when at least three

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.650
committee members are present,
and identification has been verified.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.820
The voting takes place in the Hunter
Association headquarters.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.240
As long as three or more
committee members are present,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.210
absentee ballots may be entered
at a different location.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.610
The vote will take place

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:03.010
from 12:00 AM on August 8th
to 11:59:59 PM on August 8th.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.470
This will not change.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.640
Any voting that occurs away from headquarters
must follow this schedule.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.300
Votes will be tallied the same day.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.970
And it is now August 8th, 12:00 AM.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.880
The vote begins.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.490
May I put it in?

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.750
This is a surprise.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.110
I wouldn't think

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.310
a murderer would be interested
in such an ordinary event.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.140
Eighty-five points.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.760
Yes, I'm not interested.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.770
See? It's blank.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.900
Then why are you here?

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.280
Ninety points...

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.520
Is someone named Ging here?

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.930
I'd like to speak to him.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.530
He's already gone...

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.260
He said the next time we see
him here will be at the runoff.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.510
Why don't you take your paper and leave?

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.170
Seventy-seven points.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.710
Okay.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.940
Heart is Valuable

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.280
You're bothering us!

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.330
Get lost! Aren't you done here?

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.700
He's assessing the goods.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.850
Ten points, twenty points, forty-five points.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:11.210
Ten points, two points, fifty points, thirty points.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.920
I guess pro Hunters are still nothing special...

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.970
If I want someone to fight,
it'll have to be a Zodiac.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.250
Ninety-five points!

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.000
Ah, I have the results for the
13th chairman's election.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.210
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 249 (37.6%)
2) Cheadle — 42
3) Ickshonpe — 26
4) Botobai, Mizaistom — 17
6) Saccho — 14
7) Ginta — 13
8) Morel — 12
9) Piyon, Cluck — 11
11) Cutie, Sanbica — 10
13) Teradein — 9

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:51.360
Valid votes, 580. Invalid votes, 48.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.760
14) Bushidora — 8
15) Ging — 7
6) Linne, Tsezguerra, Biscuit — 6

26) Satotz, Menchi, 7 others — 3
35) Hisoka, Saiyu, 9 others — 2
46) Gon, Hanzo, 25 others — 1

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.550
Absentees, 33.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.760
(Wrote own name only, misspelled name,
voted for previous chairman, no name given, etc.)
(Gon, Shoot, Kurapika, Killua,
Shalnark, and others, totaling 28)

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.860
None of the candidates received a majority.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.710
The turnout was 87.7%.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.890
As the conditions were not met,
the vote must be redone.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.410
Hey!

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.580
Can't I take a look?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.460
No.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.150
I'm just curious!

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.550
I won't allow anyone to view the ballots.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.130
Since I was designated election chairman,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.660
this is my decision to make.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.320
It's no fun if I can't see who voted for whom!

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.910
Scrooge! Baldy!

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.910
Moron.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.410
Are you bored?

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.170
And yourself?

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.460
So, Hisoka...

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.920
You probably don't watch the news.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.680
The election was held because
Chairman Netero died.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.210
Rumors say he died alongside
the mutant Ants he was fighting,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.820
and the Association received
a lot of land in reward.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.870
Ants?

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.280
As I thought.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.690
A lot's happened around the world,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.700
while you were chasing Chrollo.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.620
If you'd stopped to think for a moment,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.030
you could have fought the
chairman or the Ants.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.460
That would require stopping to think...

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.590
Maybe you can become my manager?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.340
Gon and Killua also joined the Ant hunt.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.840
Gon's on the verge of death, and Killua's
gone to speak to our father.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:23.950
What did you say?

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.100
At this rate, they'll both die.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.780
Both of them?

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.870
I can't have that happen.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.080
Illumi, explain clearly.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.700
There is actually another
younger Zoldyck brother...

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.770
I want to get rid of him.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.410
Illumi, Milluki, Killua, Kalluto...

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.410
Who is the fifth brother they share?

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.040
Next time: Request x And x Wish.
