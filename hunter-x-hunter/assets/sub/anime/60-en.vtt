WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.750
You're really sure? You won't tell them?

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.480
Yes.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.990
Right now, they should be
spending every second training.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.250
Tell them we'll meet again.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.490
Sure.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.970
So long.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.020
Goodbye.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.990
Oh, one second...

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.250
Look after Kurapika.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.690
He acts calm, but he can be rash.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.000
He's smart, but doesn't
always think things through.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.890
It looks like he's opened up to you,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.880
so could you act as a brake?

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.510
Yes.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.260
You're very soothing.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.020
You have the most pleasant
heartbeat I've heard in this city.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.670
It's soft, expansive, and very warm.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.900
You would make an excellent
doctor or teacher.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.810
You're well suited to such careers.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.030
I recommend a career change.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.680
Well, I'll think about it.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.190
I need to get serious about this...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.050
End x And x Beginning

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.640
#16 has won <i>Greed Island</i> for 27.8 billion!

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.650
Thank you very much!

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.540
That bastard's serious
about buying every copy.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.330
And he's aware of my budget.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.570
Only one copy left.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.720
Damn...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.320
I'm going to win this auction!

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.080
What? He left?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.680
We'll see him again.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.580
He said to keep training hard.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.080
What? He didn't have to worry about that...

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.840
Weren't you happy that Kurapika
was leaving Yorknew City?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.670
Sure, but he left without telling us.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.930
Here.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.350
It's from Zepile.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.160
He said that you'll see him again.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.560
What?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.960
Zepile-san's gone, too?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.850
Yeah, and he recovered your
hundred million, as promised.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.390
He really did...

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.000
Now you can buy back
your Hunter License.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.160
Yeah...

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.390
Zepile-san really is special.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.700
Man, that Hunter License is a real gem.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.590
The pawn shop forked over a
hundred million on the spot.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.960
In a proper auction, you could
probably add two zeros...

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.620
I know!

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.890
I should become a pro Hunter
so I can sell the license...

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.010
I could live off the interest alone.
And forget about debt!

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.240
Okay, then let's get crackin'!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.250
And start prepping for the Hunter Exam!

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.150
#16 wins <i>Greed Island</i> for 60.2 billion.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.300
Thank you very much.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.160
60.2 billion..

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.740
That's insane.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.170
And he won all seven copies.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.510
But it cost him half of his wealth.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.920
Recently, an unknown party
stole a copy of </i>Greed Island<i>

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.230
won at auction for 30.5 billion by Mr. Battera.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.790
But, not to be discouraged, yesterday he
won another copy for 27.8 billion,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.690
and another today for 60.2 billion.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.940
He must have some reason
to go so far for this game.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.690
I've heard that upon clearing the game,
you receive a treasure map.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.950
Or a giant dragon appears
to grant your wish.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.950
All kinds of rumors are flying around.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.800
Thank you!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.620
I'm going home.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.460
Mr. Battera was able to acquire
all the copies of <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.030
He's also seeking players,
but today's the deadline!

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.220
There's already an amazing
line outside the venue.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.630
I apologize for keeping everyone waiting.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.230
We will now begin selecting the players.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.600
As everyone already knows,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.180
you must be able to use <i>Nen</i> for this game.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.470
The test will proceed as follows.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.710
First, we need each applicant
to demonstrate their <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.120
We will then make our decision.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.880
The judge will be the
pro Hunter, Mr. Tsezgerra!

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.010
The Money Hunter Tsezgerra!

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.910
If he's involved...

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.720
This game must pay big dividends.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.140
Let us begin the test.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.640
One at a time, come up
and show me your <i>Ren</i>.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.900
A shutter and curtain will block
any view of the stage,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
so other applicants cannot
see what's happening.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.190
The moment we've chosen thirty-two
players, the test will end.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.410
Please step this way to take the test.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.920
That's our only explanation?

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.940
Would the first applicant
please step in.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.240
They only gave us a minimal explanation
and left everything unknown.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.660
But the others are already moving
like it's the natural response.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.490
They must know.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.360
Those guys aren't going to answer any questions.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.800
Our task is simple.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.330
Deduce all we can from the information
provided, and then do our best.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.530
I'm certain they're judging
us on the entire process.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.830
Approximately two hundred are in the hall.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.000
About a hundred have already lined up.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.970
At least fifty are watching from the sidelines.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.470
And twenty haven't moved an inch.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.610
Which group chose correctly?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.230
Next, please.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.600
Next.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.480
Something's wrong...

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.500
Ten people have gone in,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.740
but no one's come out!

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.130
Does that mean they all passed?

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.630
This is bad.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.020
Should we get in line?

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.500
Those guys are hopeless...

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.860
They don't stand a chance.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.500
Huh?

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.040
I'm talking about the ones still in

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.630
line and those waiting nearby.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.390
Especially the ones
standing next to the line.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.060
They're probably waiting
for someone to return,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.140
so they can ask what's inside.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.050
If you did some research
and used your head,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.330
you'd see there's no rush.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.390
In other words, you can't
send in new players.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.240
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.490
I get it!

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.460
This time, they aren't
choosing thirty-two players!

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.000
Exactly.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.120
It's been over ten years,
and no one's cleared the game.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.480
And new players can't begin
if old ones are still alive.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.200
Meaning that they have
to save a few spots

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.020
in case any extraordinary
players appear.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.270
I'd guess they'll choose
around twenty this round...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.340
Personally, I'd say that those in line

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.270
Anyone worthwhile either
got in line at once,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.540
or figured out the trick and stayed in
their seats to focus, like we did.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.910
Wouldn't you agree, kid?

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.200
Gon?

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.830
You realized what was going on?

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.050
Well, it was just a hunch.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:41.300
I thought it was only natural that the hosts
would want to test everyone here.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.120
That's true.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.060
You win, kid.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.620
Yeah, I'm impressed.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.070
Not many people can stick to their ideals.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.820
The steeper and more dangerous the path,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.330
the greater the need for both wit
and ignorance to move forward.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.580
Next, please.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.790
My name is Puhat.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.400
Nice to meet you.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.330
People who act smart usually fail.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.090
He can hear you.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.520
But he's right.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.100
I was too focused on logically
deducing the best method.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.160
I'm heading over.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.730
Yep, good luck.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.170
If I want to advance,
I'll have to take risks.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.860
Because I've chosen a dangerous path!

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.870
Listen to me... Never take risks.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.260
Act only when success is guaranteed.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.310
Otherwise, wait.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.810
Waiting is our most crucial job.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.590
If victory isn't assured, revealing your
strength is the most foolish move to make.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.260
That's how my old man operates.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.010
But I'm no longer an assassin.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.830
I'm a Hunter!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.440
Let me see your <i>Ren</i>.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.270
Can I show you my <i>Hatsu</i> instead?

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.100
That's fine.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.280
You're free to show me anything
that demonstrates your power.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.400
Prove that the <i>Ren</i> I saw previously

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.800
Then, I'll get started.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.550
He changed his aura into electricity!

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.620
In theory, it's certainly possible...

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.340
But it's unbelievable

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.560
that he learned this from
scratch in four days!

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.930
Well? Need to see more?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.120
No, that's enough.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.310
You pass.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.810
Yes!

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.650
However, this technique could not

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.590
You'd require years of
torturous training,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.810
Who are you?

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.030
Strong electricity?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.390
From birth, I've been
exposed to electricity.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.800
Family reasons.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.040
Seven people...

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.320
That guy was right.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.830
The people who passed are those
who moved immediately

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.380
or waited in their seats.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.030
Well, I wonder if Gon will be okay.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.180
Gon.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.640
Killua!

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.980
Good, you got chosen.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.140
Of course.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.310
Was that boom your doing?

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.170
Uh-huh.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.670
Honestly...

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.990
Those kids are scary.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.280
Well, allow me to congratulate you.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.820
The twenty-one people
here have earned the

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.680
right to play <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.690
Upon clearing the game,
you will receive 50 billion Jenny.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.670
The details are in the contract,

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.820
so read and sign it before
you depart at 5 PM.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.330
Cheers!

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.540
You've made it past the first stage.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.400
Could you look at this for us?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.700
What is it?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.330
A contract?

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.610
Looks like it can be summarized in three points.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.480
First, you can't file any claims
if you're injured or die.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.920
Second, any items that you bring out

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.800
Third, if you clear the game,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.600
you will receive a
50-billion Jenny reward.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.740
I don't see any problems.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.420
Yep!

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.370
So once you sign it, you're good to go.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.100
That second point seems important.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.290
"Anything that you
bring out of the game."

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.990
That's why he's paying the big bucks.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.570
Anything? Like what?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.490
I'm willing to hand it over.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.930
I'm not looking for items.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.000
I just want to get closer to Ging!

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.710
See ya.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.410
Good luck on your exam, Leorio.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.930
Yeah, you guys be careful.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.010
Next time we see you,
you'll be a doctor.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.270
Wouldn't that mean we won't see

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.520
We plan to clear the
game much more quickly.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.770
I don't intend to fall behind.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.230
Now, then...

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.400
Before we begin, let me
explain a few things.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.620
The individual game copies
are not independent.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.480
It doesn't matter which
console you start from.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.450
You will all arrive at the same place.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.470
Consider it a virtual area accessible
from any spot on this planet.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.630
Fizz...

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.410
I will now hand out memory cards.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.750
You will head immediately into the game.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.150
But first, we must decide the order.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.140
Order?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.590
Only one may enter the game area at a time.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.300
We will decide the order now,

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.650
Then let's use rock-paper-scissors.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.150
Yes! I'm first!

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.150
Oh?

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.910
You're the boy who had a save file.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.910
Damn, I'm 17th!

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.170
Do you want to use it?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.170
Don't worry.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.320
Your initial destination is

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.180
Ging...

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.510
This game is a message from Ging to me.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.180
I'm going to trust him!

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.190
I'll use my own card.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.690
Then put the ring on,
and start the game.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.440
Gon.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.470
Wait in the starting
area until I get there.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.590
Once you see a "Now Playing" message,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.010
Welcome to Greed Island.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.530
You must be Mr. Gon Freecss.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.380
I will now explain how the game works.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.030
Would you care to listen?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.900
Sure.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.510
In this game, two magic spells are

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.040
Book and Gain.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.920
Place the hand with the ring in
front of you, and say, "Book."

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.760
Book.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.180
In this game, your task is
to collect certain cards.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.180
That book is for storing the
cards you've collected.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.190
Please look at the first page.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.190
Each slot is labeled with a number.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.480
You can only place cards of the
same number in these slots.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.700
These are your "restricted slots."

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.200
Please flip ahead a few pages.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.350
Wait, there aren't any numbers!

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.160
Yes, you may place any
card inside these slots.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.210
These are your "free slots."

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.340
There are 100 restricted slots,
numbered 0 to 99.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.840
Then, you have another 45 free slots.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:42.100
To clear this game, you must
fill the 100 restricted slots.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.920
I just need to collect a hundred cards?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.850
Yes.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.590
Specifically, you must
transform one hundred items

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.970
into cards and put them in your book.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.860
Transform them?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.310
For example, if you obtain a sword,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.040
it will become a card
the moment you get it.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.620
If you wish to use a card as the item,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.720
Gain...

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.450
However, once you've used Gain to return

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.050
a card to item form, you can never

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.380
transform it into a card again.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.070
If you want to make it a card again,
you must reacquire the item.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.830
Do you understand everything so far?

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.890
Yeah, basically...

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.810
There are two other cases in which

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.990
you cannot transform
an item into a card.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.220
The first is when you reach the item's

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.400
maximum card transformation limit.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.620
Card transformation limit?

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.800
Yes, every item in this game has
a card transformation limit.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.660
For example, if an item has a
transformation limit of three,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.380
and three players have already

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.670
the fourth to find it will be
unable to change it into a card.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.300
In the second case...

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.360
Huh?

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.810
If you don't place the card into
your book within one minute,

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.210
it will automatically revert to an item.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.910
In this case, as well,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.060
you can never transform
that item into a card again.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.470
Do you understand?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.570
Yeah, kinda...

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.570
Finally, the most important note...

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.070
I can't remember all of this...

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.430
If a player dies,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.270
their book and ring are destroyed

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.540
Does it matter anymore if you're dead?

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.090
That concludes my explanation.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.040
You'll need to learn everything else

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.600
Uh-huh, got it.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.640
Thanks.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.620
I wish you the best of luck.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.580
Please take those stairs.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.940
Loading save data.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.610
I have a message from Ging Freecss.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.490
From Ging?

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.700
I'm glad to see you've made it, Gon.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.560
My friends and I made this game.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.150
Enjoy yourself.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.200
But if you expected a clue to my
location, you're out of luck.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.630
I just wanted to show
off this game to you.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.380
It doesn't matter what brought you here.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.580
Because you won't be able to leave

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.250
So play away.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.720
Gon has finally stepped foot inside

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.990
A new adventure is about to begin.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:05.360
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.740
The descriptions on cards are written

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.440
in the Hunter language,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.890
but we'll translate them

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.840
into Japanese for your convenience.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.370
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.620
Gain!

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.250
G.I. Tutorial

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue!

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.880
Next time: Invitation x and x Friend.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880
Thanks, Gon.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.130
Thanks, Killua.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.460
Thanks, Gon!

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.800
Thanks, Killua!

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.970
You're embarrassing me!
