WEBVTT

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, for verification...

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.360
Are you Pakunoda, from the Troupe?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.610
Of course.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.710
She's telling the truth.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.210
I will present each of you with two conditions.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.150
If you abide by them,
I will release your leader.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.970
Pay attention, Pakunoda.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.010
He's more concerned about his friends
than killing me for his vengeance.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.730
That is the chain user's weakness!

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.060
Signal x To x Retreat

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.260
I'll begin with the leader.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.460
First, you are forbidden to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.070
Second...

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.060
Am I certain about this?

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.030
If I eliminate the boss,
the spider will fall apart.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.460
That was the whole idea.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.420
But...

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670
I have no value as a hostage.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.770
Everything he says is true.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.750
But the spider can move,
even without a head.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.260
The leader isn't absolute...

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.270
If necessary, the group is
willing to abandon its leader.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.190
That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.190
I can disable their leader,
but that won't cripple the Troupe!

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.160
However, is there any alternative?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.290
Is there some kind of miracle

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.200
that can get me out of this bind?!

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.800
There isn't.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.690
I can think of nothing...

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.380
Yes, this is right.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.270
Right now, this is what I should do.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.670
I must get them back.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.310
That is my top priority!

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.670
I don't want to lose

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.200
any more friends!

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.590
Second, you may not contact
any member of the Troupe.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.070
Those are the two conditions.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.740
And to make certain that you adhere to them,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.040
I will use my Judgment Chain,
the Arbiter Little Finger, on your leader.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.290
You decide if this is acceptable, Pakunoda.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.160
Okay.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.520
You're next, Pakunoda.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.790
First,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.300
release Gon and Killua unharmed,
before midnight, without any tricks.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.030
Second, you may not speak
a single word about me.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.330
If you have no objections,
I will use my chain on you.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.980
Okay.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.300
If Gon and Killua were being
controlled by a Manipulator,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.030
could you tell from their heartbeats?

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.300
It's certainly possible.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.360
I've met Killua-kun, and I know how
his normal heartbeat sounds.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.410
So I could tell if anything had changed.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.680
That's good enough.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.680
I have something to say before the exchange.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.820
Kurapika...

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.250
In the back of your mind,
you sense that something is amiss.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.080
Why did she come alone?

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.440
If the Troupe were as merciless as expected,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.590
this deal would be impossible.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.960
You people are the ones on the ropes.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.720
Their rules are ironclad,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720
and their boss accepts them.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.580
But what about the others?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.230
This woman appears to be different.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.980
This woman you despise
with everything you have

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580
is driven by the same motive that drives you.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.240
She wishes

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.310
to save her companion, her boss.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.010
You must have realized this.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.220
Start by returning to your companions.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.240
Inform them of the hostage exchange.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.570
I want you to bring the hostages to
Lingon Airport before midnight.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.200
Bring no one else.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.860
Tell no one where you're going.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.450
Very well.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.390
You have a deal.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.270
Take me back to the airport.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.020
Why haven't you asked any questions?

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.940
You know who I am, don't you?

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.530
You aren't worried?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.440
You don't find this deal unreasonable?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.040
Do you truly believe I'll return your leader?

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.540
Yes.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.460
You wouldn't ask those questions

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.900
if you intended to deceive me.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.050
Does he really expect us to
accept those conditions?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.350
Tell us where he is, Pakunoda.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.690
We'll kill the kids, then deal
with the chain user.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.190
You're insisting?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.660
I insist.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.190
If you don't tell us, I won't let you leave.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.070
I refuse to tell you where he is,
and I am taking the kids alone.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.820
Don't interfere.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.010
Interfere?

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.330
Who's the one interfering with <i>our</i> plans?!

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.330
Go, Pakunoda.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.080
We'll stop them.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.200
Stop us?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.080
Are you trying to insult us?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.810
You're serious?

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.790
I don't get it.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.340
Have you lost your minds?

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.330
I bet they were defeated by the
chain user before we arrived.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.970
They're probably under his control.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.980
This is a waste of time.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.600
I'll make them talk.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.600
Is it really so hard to understand?

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.620
You don't understand why Pakunoda
wants to leave without a word?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.270
You don't understand why
Machi is stopping you?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.540
You honestly think they're being controlled?

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.650
They want to rescue your boss!

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.330
Is it so hard to understand
the desire to save a friend?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.870
Shut up, kid!

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.500
Are you that desperate to be spared?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.540
I'm not doing this for my sake.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.140
Take back those words!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.280
Good grief.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.010
I refuse.
If you've a problem, come here.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.900
The second you take a step,
I'll rip your head off.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.900
Then I won't budge an inch!

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.400
Kurapika isn't like you.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.990
No matter how much he hates someone,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.330
he wouldn't lose control and
kill them without mercy.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.090
If he makes a promise,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.970
he will definitely keep his word!

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.420
After meeting him in person,
Pakunoda knows this.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.150
If you follow his conditions,
he'll return your boss!

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.220
That's enough, kid...

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.620
Don't think you can say anything you want!

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.810
That's enough.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.800
Let Pakunoda go.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.180
You're siding with them?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.430
Shal,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.530
right now, what would our
worst-case scenario be?

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.660
The boss is already dead,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.970
Pakunoda and the others are being controlled,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.570
we can't find the chain user,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.780
and the two kids escape...

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.030
Then, you've got it wrong.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.720
The worst-case scenario would be that
we all die and the spider perishes.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.450
By comparison, your scenario
would be quite pleasant.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.010
Am I wrong?

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.670
N-No, you're right.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.610
I don't care about your reasons.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.500
You're being too reliant on the boss.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.540
If the Troupe falls apart as a result,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.930
that's the greatest betrayal you
could make toward the boss.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.360
If we keep bickering, that could well happen.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.490
Cool off.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.690
Let them have their way...

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.320
Pakunoda can take the kids.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.870
If the boss doesn't return,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.960
we kill the members being controlled,
and start to rebuild the spider.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.890
It's extremely simple.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.050
I'm fine with that.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.920
If that's what it takes to satisfy you.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.250
Well, I'm not being controlled,
and it won't be easy to kill me.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.920
Hello?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.710
Put the hostages on the phone.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.590
Don't break it!

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220
Are you okay?

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.400
Are they there?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.350
Yeah, they're all here.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.850
Hey!

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.850
We're following your orders.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.900
Aren't you going to follow them?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.430
The chain user can't monitor our location now.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.490
Shut up.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.230
If I give chase, you'll all stop me.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.120
For now, I'll just sit and wait.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.110
If the boss fails to return, I'll kill you, too.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.750
Go ahead.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.590
Board the waiting airship.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.830
The pilot already has his orders.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.170
As promised, it's just the three of them.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.260
We can't be sure until the airship takes off.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.530
Stay alert.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.890
There's someone over there.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.060
That's

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.690
Hisoka!

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.670
Hi...

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.190
Why are you here?!

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.270
Did you sneak out?

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.920
No need for concern...

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.950
I left a dummy behind.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.100
Hurry up.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.950
Without needles, I can only change
my face for four to five hours.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.990
What are you up to?

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.310
Allow me on the airship with them.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.620
If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.460
Bastard...

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.100
Just kidding.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.540
That would be such a waste.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.160
My target is the boss.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.330
Once he's released, I'll get off the airship.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.980
I want to fight him.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.420
That's all I want.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.000
Killua, place the phone next to your heart.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.570
It's fine, nothing's wrong with him.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.010
Okay, let's begin the exchange!

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.530
If you talk to or make any contact
with a Troupe member, you die.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.920
Now you will get to experience the pain

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.540
of losing your home.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.550
I've waited a long time for this moment.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.780
Now...

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.190
Let's do this.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.140
I no longer need this.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.390
This won't be considered an internal spat now,

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.130
so you needn't hold back.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.400
I see.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.410
You aren't a Troupe member,
so we can talk.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.370
I can't fight you.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.920
Rather, I'm not worth fighting.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.930
He used his Judgment Chain on my heart.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.160
I can no longer use my <i>Nen</i>.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.350
We can leave.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.310
Oh...

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.810
Hisoka returned to the airship without fighting.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.520
The leader realized that Hisoka
wasn't a Troupe member,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.320
so he explained about my chains.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.320
I'm not surprised that Hisoka wasn't interested

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.830
in fighting someone without <i>Nen</i>.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.010
He wasn't a Troupe member?

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:11.830
No.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.460
How did you sneak out?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.580
I have a friend who's good with disguises.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.210
Don't worry.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.840
I no longer have any reason to kill Chrollo.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.550
I'm not interested in broken toys.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.850
"You can slip out now..." There.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.960
That's right.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.350
My real fortune mentioned

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.320
I would have a date with the boss on Tuesday.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.890
And when I left,

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.490
the Troupe was supposed to be
down to half its members.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.320
Fate appears to be changing, bit by bit.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.740
I'm sorry for putting you in danger.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.290
Nah...

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.410
You used your chains on the boss, right?

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.000
Yeah, but...

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.030
This isn't the end.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.020
Meow.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.860
Where's the boss?

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.380
He won't be coming here.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.530
Don't mess with me.
Explain yourself!

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.510
Depending on your response...

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.560
Don't worry.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.280
In return...

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.230
I can only shoot six bullets at once.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.090
That's enough for the
remaining founding members.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.040
Feitan.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.290
Phinks.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.290
Machi.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.300
Nobunaga.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.550
Shalnark.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.800
Franklin.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.060
Do you trust me?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.310
Paku, you can't mean to...

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.170
Hey, are you being controlled by—

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.810
Phinks!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.390
Have some faith.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.940
It's Paku.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.450
My memories...

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.160
My feelings...

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.580
I pass them all to you.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.930
Please...

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.750
Let all this

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.720
end with me...

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.840
Paku.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.530
She's dead.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.300
What's going on?

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.490
Let me explain.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.890
I understand everything.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.700
Pakunoda was...

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.770
I hope Kurapika's fever doesn't break.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.370
Yeah...

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.820
Wait, did you just say what I think you said?

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.500
Kurapika shouldn't fight the Troupe anymore.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.440
I thought of something when Kurapika
told me about his powers.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.910
If he'd just wanted revenge,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.250
he would have chosen different abilities.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.190
Really?

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.690
If he'd only wanted to kill them,

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.580
he wouldn't have gone to the
trouble of chaining their hearts.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.950
Maybe if he only had one target.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.750
But Kurapika's dealing with the entire Troupe.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.010
Even if he captures one,
he can't kill them right away.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.670
And he needs to extract information
about the other members.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.730
Oh...

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.130
Personally,

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.050
I think his powers were meant
specifically for revenge.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.900
Oh...

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.400
But that was his original objective.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.280
Kurapika is different now.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.360
I have good friends...

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.630
But you do have a point.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.050
I'd prefer him to stay still for a while.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.370
If their boss doesn't come back,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.390
they'll be even more
determined to find Kurapika.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.540
Yeah.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.970
We'll have to be extremely careful

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.170
when we go to the auction house.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.080
So, do you really have a plan for
obtaining a copy of <i>Greed Island</i> ?

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.200
Your plan is all we have to go on!

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.330
Y-Yeah, but it's a fifty-fifty deal.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.180
Originally, didn't you say it had
a seventy percent chance?

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.680
I get it... That's clever.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.800
Actually, that may be our only shot.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.170
Realistic and sound.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.050
I think it has an eighty percent chance!

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.690
Really?

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.070
Yeah, we can make it work!

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.570
The auction is in Hall B.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.450
That way. Over there.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.060
Wow!

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.920
Huh?

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.700
Why are they here?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.720
How would I know?!

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.030
Hey, that was cold.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.470
No need to run away.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.390
Why wouldn't we run away?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.860
Don't worry.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.410
We're not going to kill you.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.440
Because we can't kill the chain user now.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.020
Huh? What do you mean?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.310
Huh?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.890
Didn't he use his chains on the boss?

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.990
That means we can't kill him.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.020
Why not?

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.030
Isn't it the other way around?

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.140
It's pretty useful to have someone
who's willing to ask questions.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.540
<i>Nen</i> doesn't necessarily disappear after death.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.010
<i>Nen</i> that's driven by hatred and regret
can persist a long time after death.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.550
That <i>Nen</i> will direct itself toward
the target of those emotions.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.860
Since the boss can no longer use <i>Nen</i>,

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.060
he could be overwhelmed by that assault.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.690
Residual <i>Nen</i> can be quite fearsome.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.440
That's why we can't kill the chain user.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.440
I'm talking too much?

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.490
I know.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.230
I won't say another word.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.450
<i>There are</i> Nen <i>users</i>

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.570
<i>who can remove other people's</i> Nen.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.460
East, huh...

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.120
So, we're done with you kids.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.360
We just came to enjoy the auction.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.470
The other members wanted to go home.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.770
Um, what happened to Pakunoda-san?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.980
She died.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.230
Huh?

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.480
Oh...

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.730
Why don't you run away?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.010
Run away?

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.610
Given my injuries, you should
be able to escape.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.660
If you did, I would lose my leverage,

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.260
and the chain user could kill the boss.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.200
So why don't you run away?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.750
Aren't you on his side?

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.870
Because we're his friends.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.210
Because we're his friends,
we don't want him to kill.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.970
So we'd prefer this to be
settled with an exchange.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.470
What's wrong?

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.760
Let's go.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.360
Paku...

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.420
Paku wanted to thank you.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.120
Next week, the story moves
into the Greed Island arc.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:16.080
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.230
Today, we introduce Chrollo.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.980
Boss of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.380
The Phantom Troupe's boss.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.330
A Specialist.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.610
He's a Specialist.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.370
He can steal and use
others' powers,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.900
He can steal other people's powers for himself,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.900
using his Skill Hunter!

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.080
an appropriate ability
for a bandit.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.170
But conditions have to be met.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.460
East, huh...

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.340
Next time: Bid x And x Haste.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.480
A bid in haste makes waste.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.300
Hey!

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.220
That's no good...
