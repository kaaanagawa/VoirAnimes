WEBVTT

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.530
Don't worry.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.160
We aren't here to get in your way.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.030
In fact, you could say we're here to help.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.530
Help?

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.070
Yeah.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.810
If we get the top score on
the quiz and win the card,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.040
we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.270
That's only five percent of your reward.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.050
It's a reasonable price, yeah?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.510
Oh, right...

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.000
They haven't heard about Battera yet.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.810
Sure, if you get the top score.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.840
Everyone else is here for the chance
to sell us the final card, too?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.750
With the game ending,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.320
they're all hoping to share in the reward.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.310
It looks like they're going
to take the quiz in teams.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.500
What should we do?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320
What? We should do it by ourselves.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.320
Yeah.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.760
Whoever scores lower gets penalized.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.210
Okay, I'm in!

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.960
Honestly... They've got guts.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.750
They just came from a fight to the death,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.970
and now they're facing the final event
in the game with such confidence.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.430
I bet those two enjoyed this
game more than anyone.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.150
Keep it up.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.060
Ging's Friends x And x True Friends

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.440
The quiz contest open to all players has begun.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.260
Then I will now start the quiz.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.400
Question one.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.820
What is the name of the elder

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.980
who gives an important hint
about #1, Patch of Forest?

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.330
A: Hira.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.730
B: Hida.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.250
C: Hiso.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.690
D: Mayu.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.830
E: Hima.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.040
Damn! I'm stumped on the first one!

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.240
Five choices?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.050
What is the condition to obtain
#17, Breath of Archangel?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.850
I caught the Bomber.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.360
#84,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.290
Paladin's Necklace, is offered as a prize
in a monthly tournament of what?

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.620
Yes!

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.620
B. Rock-Paper-Scissors
C. Two-Man Tug-of-War
D. Snowball Fight
E. Kick the Can

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.170
Okay!

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.130
And now for the final question...

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.340
What is the name of card #0?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.150
A: Ruler's Banquet.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.180
B: Ruler's Invitation.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.500
C: Ruler's Reception.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.890
Can't remember...

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.890
C. Ruler's Reception
D. Ruler's Welcome
E. Ruler's Blessing

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.650
The quiz is over.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.650
I will now announce the player with the top score.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.510
With a score of 87 out of 100 points,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.040
our top scoring player

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.830
is Gon.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.940
Yes!

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.550
We have all one hundred!

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.990
You did it.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.500
I hate to say it, but you beat us...

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.420
Congratulations.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.560
Thanks.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.410
That means Killua gets penalized.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.500
Damn...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.140
How many points did I get?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.870
Ruler's Invitation?

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.580
Ruler's Invitation
An invitation from
this island's ruler.
The envelope contains
a map that shows the
castle and a badge.
Player must have badge
to enter the castle.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.580
Looks like only the one with
the badge is invited.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.030
So Limeiro is the capital?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.680
I have to go alone?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.770
We'll wait for you by the castle.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.910
Hey, he really got it.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.110
That kid really collected all the cards.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.930
Hey, let's have a contest with
all your cards at stake.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.000
Sorry, but you don't have a choice.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.470
Then I'll take an Accompany card.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.050
Wait, that won't work.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.070
We haven't been to Limeiro before.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.480
So we should use Drift...

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.640
Since we've been to the other cities before.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.180
Drift
Transports you to a
previously unvisited city.
(If all cities have been
visited, Drift is used,
without transporting player.)
[SR][NORM]

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.890
In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.250
then come back for you guys.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.190
Accompany will work after that.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.310
Drift on!

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.990
Bingo!

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.370
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.940
Let's go, Gon.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.370
Yep.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.780
Accompany on!

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.780
Limeiro!

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.250
Those kids are amazing.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.790
They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.780
Of course...

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.350
They even defeated the bombers.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.350
It's true,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.240
those boys are much stronger
than when I first met them.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.610
But they're still weaker than
Genthru in raw power.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.820
They must have executed a brilliant plan...

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.320
Well, no matter.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.610
I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.410
Magnetic Force on.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.730
Chrollo Lucilfer.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.000
I'll head back to reality and
make a fortune exorcising <i>Nen</i>.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.290
I wonder what he's feeling.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.380
What he's feeling?

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.270
He might meet Ging, after all.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.380
The father he's been searching for all this time.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.320
Welcome to Greed Island Castle.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.880
Come in.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.950
This place is a dump!

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.520
I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.650
Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.710
I hear you're Ging's son?

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.150
Why don't you have a seat?

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.500
Uh...

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.370
Where should I sit?

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.450
Isn't there any open space?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.540
Clear some space, then...

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.790
Like this!

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.780
Uh...

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.990
Wait, where did I put it?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.920
Oh! Here it is!

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.230
There you go.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.180
Ruler's Blessing
Castle awarded to the
winner of the quiz.
Comes with capital city
(population 10,000).
The city's residents
will obey any laws or
commands you give.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.270
Ruler's Blessing,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.180
the reward for the top scorer.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.720
How about it?!

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.450
Isn't it cool?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.640
Are you amazed? Well?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.410
There are 10,000 people in this city.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.320
One of them could be...

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.430
Wait, did I get your hopes up?

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.360
Well?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.820
Or were you just thinking that
Ging could be the ruler?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.420
I was not!

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.080
I never considered that Ging might be here.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.900
Oh, really now?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.390
That's good, then...

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.040
Since he's not.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.750
Dwun-san, can we get to business?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.050
Oh, my bad.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.250
Listen up.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.530
You've collected all one hundred cards.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.680
Which triggers a new event.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.560
Hmm...

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.560
Oh, here it is!

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.430
This is it.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.530
Open it up.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.390
You can place three restricted
slot cards in this binder.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.750
You can then take those three back
for use in the real world.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.590
However!

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.990
You cannot take multiple
copies of the same card.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:10.490
You must choose three different restricted
slot cards from the hundred in your binder.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.220
Okay, you've reached the ending...

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.570
Do you want the normal ending,
or the ending just for you?

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.100
Just for me?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.820
Yep, that's right.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.500
Which one do you want? Well?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.940
Then I'll take the normal one.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.110
Why would you choose that one?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.300
I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.860
the normal ending, my friends
can watch with me, right?

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.430
I see...

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.540
Dwun-san?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:41.870
Huh?

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.900
Would you stop teasing him?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.160
I'm sorry...

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.880
There's no such thing as an ending just for you.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.840
What? Really?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.630
However, there's a message we've been told
to give you only after you beat the game.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.330
Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.100
I'm List.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.340
He's Dwun.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.400
As you probably know,
we're friends of your old man.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.340
This game was created by Ging
and ten of his friends.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.330
The name "Greed Island" was created

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.310
from the first letter in each of their names.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.910
Your father was in charge,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.020
so we wanted a word that began
with "G," and settled on "Greed."

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.300
Have you met Razor?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.780
He's the "R," and I'm the "L."

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.860
The girl who explains the game at the start

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.610
is the twin of the girl you see
when leaving the island.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.120
Eeta and Elena.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.320
Both names begin with "E."

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.240
And then, we have "D"!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.150
Wanna hear my story? Well?

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.840
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.150
Y-Yeah...

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.130
Okay, pay attention.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.650
You see, that Ging...

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.890
was a totally mean guy!

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.430
Totally mean!

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.400
My name is Dwun!

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.170
What do you think is the first letter?

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.420
Huh? Isn't it "D"?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.300
Even you, huh?

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.150
Of course you'd think so...

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.330
After all, you're Ging's son.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.180
Weren't we talking about "D"?

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.700
It's "W!" "W!"

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.480
W-d-w-u-n-e.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.450
Wdwune!

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.060
That was my name!

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.570
But even my oldest friends
thought it began with "D."

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.870
So when we decided on the
game's name, I was clear...

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.520
That my name began with "W."

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.080
What do you think Ging said?

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.650
Really?

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.240
Then, ditch the "W."

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.480
Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.530
Dwun.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.960
Can you believe him?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.220
He changed my name without asking.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.360
Just so the title of the game would work!

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.860
What's really amazing

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.970
is that Ging had legally changed
the name a minute later.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.230
He only needed a phone and a computer.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.230
What's worse is that he even removed
the "E" because he got confused!

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.890
But your luck has been better as a result.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.900
I guess! Ever since...

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.040
Once I've chosen the three cards,
I'm supposed to go to the port.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.030
Did they tell you about your father?

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.420
Yeah, but they don't know
where he is right now.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.760
Oh...

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.470
So I guess the game didn't have any clues.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.170
Well, that's what the starting message said.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.190
Yeah, that's true.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.600
So, what will you do for the three cards?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.050
How about we each pick one?

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.930
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.540
Then I want Blue Planet!

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.410
This is still the best one!

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.690
I can't wait to see the real thing...

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.390
Which one do you want, Killua?

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.330
I'm still thinking.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.780
Have you decided, Gon?

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.700
Yeah, I think so.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.220
Really? Which one?

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.950
Let's see...

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.630
This one.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.640
Which one?

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.480
Wait, why this one?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.050
I get it.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.690
That makes sense.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.210
You're only allowed to take
restricted slot cards...

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.590
Yep, that sounds fun!

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.790
When did you have the idea?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.090
The moment I saw this card.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.910
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.340
But this one won't be enough.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.360
Right, we also need this one.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.100
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.100
Eh?

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.250
Do you think this will work?

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.530
Yeah.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.170
And this is the only way to do it!

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.700
Wait, what is this?

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.980
What are you talking about?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.490
You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.490
Let me in on this!

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.460
Congratulations on clearing the game.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:47.470
Please choose three restricted
slot cards from your binder.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.720
You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.700
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.330
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.410
#81, Blue Planet,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.050
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.480
and #84, Paladin's Necklace.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.770
Are you sure these are the three cards you want?

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.600
Yep.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.740
Then I will now return your ring.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.920
Good work.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.180
Thank you...

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.620
Uh, Elena-san!

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.760
You remembered my name?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.870
Thank you.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.180
Goodbye.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.700
Welcome back!

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.620
Yeah.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.020
We're back in the real world now?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.010
I can't tell.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.900
Well, the game was part of the real world.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.450
Hey, hurry up!

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.150
Bring out your binder...

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.210
Book.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.680
Gain!

00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:59.840
This is it!

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.040
This is what I wanted!

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.540
The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.360
I'm so happy!

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.790
What should I name it?

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.830
Pla-chan?

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.220
Maybe Blue-chan?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.270
Planet-chan?

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.750
Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.920
So, are you sure about the two you picked?

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.770
Yeah, these are the best ones, right?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.440
Yep.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.820
Then let's give it a go!

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.950
Yeah!

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.180
Gain!

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.450
Give it to me, Killua.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.690
Yes! It worked!

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.720
Okay!

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.350
I see.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.030
You used Transform to make
Accompany a restricted slot card,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.960
then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.600
That's clever thinking...

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.870
But I'm surprised you'd do
all that for an Accompany,

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.990
rather than choose a restricted slot card.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.750
Yeah...

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.240
Well, if I hadn't been the first
one of us to enter the game,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.340
I probably wouldn't have noticed.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.120
Remember when we played
rock-paper-scissors here?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.780
Rock-paper-scissors?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.500
Yeah.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.250
I was the first to enter the game.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.570
And while I was waiting for Killua,
no one else was around.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.140
Which means the first person I met in the game

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.010
should have been the second
one to go in, Goreinu-san.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.650
But when I checked my binder,

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.310
there was someone I met before him.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.420
Nigg
Goreinu

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.530
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.910
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.420
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.040
He was probably trying to tell me this:

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.280
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.080
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.920
Your dedication is really something.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.440
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.370
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.900
My best friend in the world!

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.300
Stupid! Cut that out!

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.650
It's embarrassing...

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.330
Really...

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.790
Stop it...

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.720
I can't take this!

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.210
It must be age.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.560
It doesn't take much to make me cry...

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.350
Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.330
No, I'll pass.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.540
I'm not interested in men who already have kids.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.770
Okay.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.970
If I stay with you any longer,
I really will get too attached.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.950
Well, take care, Bisky.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.100
Yeah.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.880
You, too.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.360
Thank you very much!

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.260
Osu!

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.770
Accompany on!

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.530
Nigg!

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.680
Bye-bye.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.110
Gon has cleared the game his father created,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.160
becoming much stronger.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.720
Is the one waiting before him really Ging?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:13.270
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.000
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.350
Today, we beat <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.360
We've introduced a whole bunch of cards.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.500
I did all the introducing!

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.610
You just fooled aro—

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.190
Game over.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.170
Killua Zoldyck                                        Gon Freecs

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.610
Next time: Reunion x And x Understanding.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.850
Hey, Killua...

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.180
Re...

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.180
