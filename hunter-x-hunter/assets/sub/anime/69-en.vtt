WEBVTT

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.320
Together, there are five of you?

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.480
Yeah, this is all of us.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.370
There are two others in my group.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.980
This only gives us a total of nine.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.370
Where do you plan to find the rest?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.520
We'll need fifteen members, right?

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.120
We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.880
Invite players who want to return
to the real world but can't.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.140
They won't be able to help,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.380
but they won't care about
receiving cards, either.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.770
Meaning that the nine of us will
have to win the contest.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.950
I don't know how strong our
opponents are, but can we?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.390
We can.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.620
Even if we can't manage eight wins,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.090
we're allowed to switch members and try again.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.400
So whether we can win depends on you guys.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.900
Show us your <i>Ren</i>.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.580
We'll decide if we want you afterwards.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.030
A x Heated x Showdown

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.310
I see our roles have been reversed.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.580
Very well.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.980
Here I go!

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.550
Awesome!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.050
If I use my full strength, I can fly higher.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.060
My record is sixteen meters,
eighty centimeters.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.960
Ready, and...

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.690
They shattered my record with ease.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.780 line:20%
Ha ha, I win.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.700
How much have they improved
in such a short period of time?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.870 line:20%
Darn!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.960
I am impressed.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.240
Although you still fall a bit
short of my full height.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.330
Okay! Let's go again!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.760
No way.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400
You won't stop until you win.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.410
One more time... Just once more!

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.640
Oh, you passed.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.590
Nice jump.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.450
Sorry...

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.410 line:20%
Once more!

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.590
They're only kids, so let it slide.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.590 line:20%
Fine.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.500
We believe that you guys are strong.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.620
But it comes down to figuring out
who to assign to which sport.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.590 line:20%
Killua, once more!

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.150 line:20%
See, I knew it...

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.350 line:20%
No more. I win!

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.350
Do we know all the sports they'll use?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.360
We've managed to confirm these eight.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.860
Beach Volleyball
Wrestling
Boxing
Juggling
Free Throws
Sumo
Bowling
Ping Pong

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.860
Depending on our success,
they may add additional sports.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.280
I understand...

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.120
Hey, this is bad!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.880
What is it?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620
Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.870
Then they're only missing...

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.560
Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.600
Over the past week, we've run various simulations

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.140
and have prepared accordingly.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.770
Given Team Genthru's current situation,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.890
we can't afford to lose.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.800
We have to win!

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.400
Yes, we'll win.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.900
This isn't too bad...

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.080
Okay, let's go.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.660
We'll begin with boxing.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.780
I'll send you packing.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.790
His special ability is teleportation.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.050
He can teleport his uppercut.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.550
Fight!

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.850
H-He's fast!

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.100
An infighter?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.850
If I'm close enough, his Emitter
advantages are worthless.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.910
He'll be so busy guarding,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.360
he won't have a chance to use teleportation!

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.780
Nice!

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.800
The pattern depicted on the ring

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.660
<i>is a sacred symbol that boosts </i>Nen.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.120
Suggesting that he can only teleport

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.040
while standing within the ring.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.540
Essentially, he's revealing that
he isn't all that strong.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.740
An opponent unworthy of us.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.300
The winner is Barry!

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.650
Yes!

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.170
The winner is Rodriot!

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.380
The winner is Kess!

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.480
Yes!

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.330
That's three wins!

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.740
In terms of combat strength,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.020
those six are very strong.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.040
This is getting interesting...

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.250
You guys can toss your matches.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.500
I'll take it from here.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.040
Roger that.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.250
Wait!

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.610
I'm done following your orders.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.260
I'll be doing things my own way now.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.890
Hey, brat! Let's step outside!

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.020
Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.090
I'm done playing around.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.350
Want me to kill you here?

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.560
Hey, Bobobo!

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.360
That's a violation of our agreement.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.780
Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.600
I don't give a damn!

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.190
I'm done playing this stupid game!

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.380
Anyone else with me?

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.910
If we team up, we can crush that bastard.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.170
And then we can use a ship
to get off this island!

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.320
You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.560
Didn't I warn you?

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.210
Y-Yes, you did...

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.970
Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.820
Okay, I'll go next.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.320
Hey, this looks bad.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.010
We can't fight those guys...

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.370
No, hold on.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.150
We'll be doing the fighting.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.850
We explained how this works.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.040
If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.990
you can just forfeit without fighting.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.830
Really?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.670
You guarantee we won't have to fight?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.340
Yeah, don't worry.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.320
That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.570
And judging by the previous conversation,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.160
he must be a Game Master.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.650
Can I ask something?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.570
That guy's dead.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.350
What about the sumo match?

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.840
Hmm? Oh, you get the win.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.030
But we never decided who we were sending.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.040
You're the one who said you
were going to do the sumo.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.580
I don't care who you give the win to.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.110
Just give it to one of the guys
standing in the back.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.310
Okay, you get the sumo win.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.050
Eh? Wait, me?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.620
That gives us four wins.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.550
Now, then...

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.050
I'll go with an eight-on-eight game

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.200
of dodgeball.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.570
Pick the eight members you'll field.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.620
I already have mine.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.690
Hold on...

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.030
How is this scored?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.690
It's one win per person, right?

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.580
Yes, one win per person.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.580
So the victorious team receives eight wins.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.230
Simple enough, yes?

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.890
So that was the plan?

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.160
No matter how many of his weaker members

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.340
we defeat, he can still win
the entire game alone.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.390
Razor and the fourteen devils...

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.850
<i>The devils are his</i> Nen <i>ability!</i>

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.000
I'm against this...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.480
If we have to field eight, you need two more!

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.360
I'm not fighting that guy!

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.730
I'm leaving now...

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.760
Once the match begins,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.410
you can deliberately let yourself be hit—

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.810
Screw that!

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.210
Didn't you see that?

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.620
If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.110
Oh, just so everything is clear,
we'll be using a normal ball.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.130
But with <i>Nen</i>, it's just as strong as
the <i>Nen</i> projectile I launched earlier.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.660
This is crazy... I'm outta here!

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.130
Sorry, but I don't want to die yet...

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.140
H-Hold on!

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.890
We'll think of something real quick.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.630
This is very bad.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.830
We only have six players of any use.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.810
So we're forced to pick two
of these spineless wimps.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.400
We'll do this by ourselves.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.160
If our lives are on the line,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.050
we should only field willing players.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.400
Do you have a problem if we only field six?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.680
Yes, actually, I can't let you do that...

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.800
You will have to field eight members.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.040
Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.630
Saying this to an in-game character
is probably pointless,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.100
but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.390
What did he do to deserve death?

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.480
Burglary-murder and rape-murder.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.150
Eleven confirmed counts alone.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.770
This is the real world.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.030
This place, Greed Island, is located
somewhere in the real world.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.030
This game takes place in the real world.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.330
Revealing that information to a player who
believes they're inside a game is a taboo.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.540
Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.720
This guy, Razor, is a Game Master,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.350
a real human.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.050
Game Master?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.210
One of the people who made this game.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.660
Huh?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.560
Wait, then...

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.220
Bobobo and the other pirates
are real death row criminals.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.750
Not only did he disobey orders;
he attempted to instigate an escape.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.070
Execution was a fair consequence.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.020
This is the real world?

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.820
That is correct.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.590
I never noticed.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.080
I hadn't even considered that.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.010
Well, it doesn't really matter.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.770
Since this island is still isolated
from the rest of the world.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.710
Wait a second.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.340
If this is the real world,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.340
does that mean that Ging is here,

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.720
on Greed Island?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.740
Ging?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.050
Ah...

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.430
So you must be Gon.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.490
Yeah.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.940
I was instructed not to go easy on you

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.980
by your old man.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.160
I've had enough...

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.560
I don't wanna die!

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.790
Count me out! I'm gone!

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.250
H-Hey!

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.210
It's okay, let them leave.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.000
But then we can't have a match!

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.510
I'll count as three.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.320
You're doing the same thing,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.870
so it shouldn't be a problem.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.520
Yeah, that's fine.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.180
Now it's eight-on-eight.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.020
I'll explain the rules.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.620
The game starts with one outside
player and seven inside.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.730
The first team to run out of inside players loses.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.030
Any player inside the court who's hit by
a ball thrown by an opponent is out,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.350
and must move outside.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.040
However,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.530
you may bring one player inside
the court again by saying "Back."

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.290
And if the ball hits an area outside
the court, without any players,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.810
the opposing team gets the ball.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.930
Now, the important stuff...

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.560
The rules regarding hits
employ a cushion effect.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.100
For example, if I throw the ball
and it hits opposing player A, ricochets,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.680
and hits opposing player B
before hitting the floor,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.570
both A and B are out.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.470
But if player B in that scenario
is able to catch the ball,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.700
player A is safe.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.810
Exactly.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.270
But if I throw the ball and it
hits opposing player A, ricochets,

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:31.180
and hits my teammate, player C,
before hitting the floor,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.830
only player C is out.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.590
Then if player C catches the ball,
does that mean player A is out?

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.220
Indeed.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.010
Uh...

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.570
Do you have a question?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.390
If an outside player hits someone
with the ball, is the hit player out?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.100
Naturally, they're out.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.320
But only one player

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.190
can return to the court using Back.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.090
I am Number 0, the ref.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.980
Let's have a clean game.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.170
We will now begin the game.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.990
Ready...

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.870
Go!

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.250
You can make the first move.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.650
You sound quite confident.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.470
Here's a little greeting, then!

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.400
You got him!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.890
Yes! That's one down!

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.400
Good!

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.150
Let's keep this up.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.400
There!

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.780
Okay, that's two down!

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.870
Oh, this is easy.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.030
Okay, all ready to go...

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.030
Huh? What did you say?

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.540
I'm prepared to defeat you now.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.540
Heh, that's funny.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.550
Show us what you've got!

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.550
H-He stopped it with one hand?

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.990
Right, then...

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.770
Time to launch the counterattack.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.320
He's standing so far back...

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.780
Is he going to pass it?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.570
Fast!

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.420
Can I dodge it?

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.320
No way!

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.570
Can I catch it and live?

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.080
No!

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.120
I'll die!

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.080
Death

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.080
White Goreinu!

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.840
Nice rebound.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.600
Goreinu's outside the court!

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.290
I see...

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.110
You have the ability to change
places with your <i>Nen</i> beasts.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.090
<i>The </i>Nen <i>creature was shattered...</i>

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.240
This reflects what Goreinu imagined would
happen when he saw Razor's attack.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.730
He immediately grasped the gap between
our opponent's strength and his own.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.450
He won't easily rid himself of that image.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.120
It'll be impossible for him to
recover during this match.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.130
He's done.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.660
Goreinu's <i>Nen</i> beast is the one that's out, right?

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.640
Yes, the exchange was performed
with <i>Nen</i>, so it broke no rules.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.620
However, Back must be used to
bring Goreinu inside the court.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.730
Damn... Is this how it ends?

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.460
All right, let's move on!

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.690
That pass is so fast!

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.200
I-It's too fast...

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.580
I can't follow the ball!

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.230
Tsezgerra!

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.950
Behind you!

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.510
It's heavy...

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.620
As heavy as a bowling ball.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.990
This is gonna have insane power.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:21.290
He focused his aura in his back,
and avoided a lethal blow.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.230
Hey, patch him up.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.670
I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.740
If a player is unable to continue
playing, they're disqualified.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.720
They won't be allowed

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.240
to play in or outside the court,
so keep that in mind.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.480
Are you okay?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.500
Yeah, I've really lost it...

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.160
Damn, in overall combat ability,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.390
I should still be stronger than they are.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.510
But when it comes to the basics like
agility and reflexes, they have me beat.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.530
It's been a while since I've
had to work really hard.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.520
Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.030
I don't think I've done any basic
training in the past few years.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.800
Ideally, we could knock out
everyone on the other team

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.030
without giving up the ball.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.990
Hisoka...

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.540
Okay, give me the ball.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.540
Oh, that's right.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.030
If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can
retrieve the ball after it hits!

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.000
Now, do try to entertain me.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.300
Surely this isn't everything you have.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.810
Very well...

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.310
Okay, that's three down!

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.810
With Back, the other team still has five players!

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.350
With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.010
All that's left is the order we target them.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.880
Question for the ref.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.880
Can the last player inside the court

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.070
use Back at the second he's hit?

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.780
That's not allowed.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.130
For a moment, there would
be zero players in the court,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.080
so that team would lose.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.080
But someone outside the court may use Back

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.070
at the instant that the last player is hit.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.590
Okay.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.920
Hisoka...

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.590
Yes, I understand.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.840
We leave him for last.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.100
He throws a strong ball.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.850
Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.940
Nice and strong!

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.820
If we're lucky, we can take out
6 and 7 at the same time!

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.270
Th-They combined?

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.760
You're strong.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.360
Is that allowed?!

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.390
It is.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.120
If you're allowed to combine,
are you allowed to split?

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.150
Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum
number of players on the court.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.260
Now!

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.760
It's my turn to attack again.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.120
Now we have to retake the ball again.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.390
If we're going to stop his ball...

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.480
Ken!

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.790
<i>Their </i>Nen <i>is smooth and quite beautiful.</i>

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.100
They must have trained hard.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.040
But if Razor throws the ball at full strength,

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.670
Ken <i>won't be enough.</i>

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.090
They must be prepared for casualties
when they recover the ball

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.540
and try to defeat him.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.820
Is it even possible?

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.210
So you know how to use <i>Ken</i>.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.940
That means you won't die.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.550
However...

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.200
That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.510
Here I come,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.310
Gon!

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.560
Bring it!

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.800
It won't work! Run away!

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.340
You'll die!

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.720
Ko!

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.220
Gon!

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.540
Where's the ball?

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.860
Crazy...

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.840
It's drilled in there.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.160
Gon!

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.340
Are you okay?!

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.650
I'm just fine!

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.850
The hell you are...

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.820
I used <i>Ko</i> to harden my arms and head,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.100
but my legs couldn't take the impact.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.830
However,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.690
next time,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.110
I'll catch it!

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.450
Gon is now fired up.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:04.430
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.860
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.580
Today, we introduce the card Accompany.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:14.750
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.170
It lets you warp everyone within 20 meters.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.100
What if a player is 21 meters large?

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.920
Continue!

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.660
Next time: Guts x And x Courage.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:24.960
Receive!

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.630
Toss!

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.720
Attack!

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.760
But we're using aura...

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.310
Because we're Hunters!
