00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.730
Toho

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.730
Toho Compagnie, Ltd.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.090
I'm Gon, 12 years old!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.090
ヒソカ サミル

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.140
I became a Hunter to meet my father Ging,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.560
and made precious friends in the Hunter Exam.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.080
I'm Killua, 12 years old like him!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.070
I'm from the Zoldyck family
of professional assassins.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.050
I wonder if I could become Gon's friend?

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.770
Obviously! We're friends!

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.220
And,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.420
next comes Kurapika!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.570
He's trying to catch the Genei Ryodan
that killed his entire Kuruta clan,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.370
and get back their red eyes that got stolen.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.680
But the Ryodan are amazing Nen users,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
and can't be caught that easily.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.910
And then,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.470
this guy is Leorio.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.890
At first he seemed to want to
become a Hunter just to get rich,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.610
but actually his dream is to become
a doctor and help those in need.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.830
These three are my friends,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.460
but let's introduce just one more person.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.540
Hisoka.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.250
A strong and creepy magician
we met in the Hunter Exam.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.410
He's an acquaintance of my
older brother Illumi too,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.130
and a super shady guy.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.580
Hisoka lives for fighting strong people,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.180
and to fight Kuroro,
the boss of the Ryodan,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.240
he took out the previous
number 4 and became one of them.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.240
That's creepy.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.160
And now! Time to start
the Hunter × Hunter movie!

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.910
What are you thinking about?

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.400
Big brother.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.640
When did you get there?

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.400
Isn't it obvious?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
I've always been here.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.450
I'm always watching you.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.530
Since it's my cute little brother's important job.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.270
I'm fine on my own.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.540
That won't do.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.110
It's my duty as your big brother to
raise you into a perfect assassin.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.340
Their ride's here.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.590
Don't show your blood thirst
until the moment you kill them.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.300
Think of yourself as nothing
but an object until then.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.130
Yeah.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.450
Are you scared?

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.990
Not really.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.080
This is what makes you
one of the Zoldycks.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.250
Hey! Pass the ball!

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.200
Just for a reminder,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.070
you don't need friends.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.230
Even if you made one,
you would only betray them.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.400
And even if you didn't betray your friend,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.720
they would betray you.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.720
And one day,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.270
you will kill that friend.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.160
Like this.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.230
Stop it!

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.840
Stooop!

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.570
Is something wrong, mister?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.560
No, it's nothing.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.150
It'll take some time still until we
arrive in Shanha City so please sleep well.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.390
Yes, thank you.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.580
Excuse me then.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.990
I would never...

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.850
betray Gon.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.240
Killua, is something wrong?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.510
Like what?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.560
Weren't you staring at my face?

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.560
I wasn't.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.570
You're lying!

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.990
I'm not.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.640
Something's suspicious...

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.270
What is?!

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.070
I wasn't looking at you or anything!

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.070
Gentlemen,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.210
some passengers are still
sleeping so please keep it down.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.270
Yeah, got it.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.650
Thank you very much.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.730
You were snoring.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.210
Snoring?

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.920
You were grinding your
teeth in your sleep too.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920
I was?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
Don't lie!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.050
Aren't you the liar here?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.780
What?!

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.950
Weren't you the one
who was lying just now!

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.950
Shut up!

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.210
It's because you were
saying stupid stuff!

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.000
It's not stupid! It was true!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.340
I said I wasn't looking at you!

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.690
Gentlemen!

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.160
Stay on your seats...

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.870
<i>please.</i>

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.430
Yes.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.430
Excuse us.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.120
Finally we got here!

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.020
Hey!

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.020
Gon, Killua!

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.290
Leorio!

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.530
A survivor of the Kuruta clan?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.290
Yeah.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.390
There was someone in this
city who appeared that way.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.140
But didn't the Kuruta clan...

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.720
The Genei Ryodan annihilated
them five years ago, right?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.220
There was a good chance it was fake,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.060
but I contacted Kurapika to go make
sure just in case.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.160
I tagged along.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.670
Why?

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.670
"Why"?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.880
That guy can get reckless when
the Kuruta clan is involved,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.180
so he needed someone
level-headed like me with him.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.200
You really care about
him, don't you?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.720
Shut up, that's embarrassing.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.050
So how did it go?

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.880
Well...

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.640
Finding someone I only
saw once proved hard.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.760
When we were about to give
up and return to the hotel,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.510
we met a boy Kurapika seemed to know.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.550
Impossible..!

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.460
That voice...

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.930
Kurapika?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.170
Pairo...

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.550
You survived..?

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.250
Kurapika...

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.250
Is that Kurapika?

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.200
Come closer.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.030
Show me your face.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.170
Pairo...

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.910
Me eyes show nothing but darkness.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.380
I did my best to help but,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.810
in the end his eyes got stolen.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.480
What happened to Kurapika?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.050
I gave him first-aid and now
he's in a hospital at the hilltop.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.600
Kurapika!

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.930
His life's not in danger for now,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.300
but he won't wake up.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.300
Why?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.090
Who knows.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.950
Kurapika...

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.990
Leorio, Kurapika is...!

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.990
What?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.040
Kurapika!

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.040
Did he regain consciousness?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040
Kurapika...

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.720
Is it Gon?

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.830
Kurapika! Thank God...

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.880
I'm sorry.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.020
You all came for me?

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.170
Leorio, after that, what did I..?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.700
You've been sleeping since then.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.030
It's been exactly three days.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.870
I see.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.470
Don't overdo it!

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.480
You didn't break any bones,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.570
but your whole body took a beating.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.570
You have fissures too.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.310
But if I don't go now...

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.750
You couldn't do anything
about that Pairo guy anyway.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.900
Your eyes were his goal from the start.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.910
I don't believe it.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.300
That someone like that
would be the real Pairo...

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.170
Kurapika...

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:37.960
No...

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960
Just maybe,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.200
Pairo really escaped that tragedy...
- Wrong!

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.620
If that Pairo was really your friend,

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.750
he wouldn't do something this cruel!

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.000
That's right...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.710
I want to think so too.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.900
Hey.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.290
Could you tell us more about Pairo?

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.040
He's from the Kuruta clan like you, right?

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:04.630
Pairo was my irreplaceable
best friend who shared my dream.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.830
Shared your dream?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.840
Back then,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:15.060
the beautiful forest I lived in with my
128 brethren was the whole world for me.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.690
Until I read that book.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.050
<i>The book a woman named Sheila
gave us after we helped her.</i>

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.930
<i>It had stories about the adventures of a Hunter.</i>

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:47.360
<i>Using a dictionary, we got absorbed in reading
it and dreaming about the outside world.</i>

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.830
But in reality you had to take a
test to go to the outside world.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.760
After passing the tests on language and common
knowledge I took part in the last exam but...

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.790
The last part is a test on self-control.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.460
We'll send you to do some
shopping in the nearest town.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.460
Nearest town?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.460
We're going to the outside world?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.370
Remember that it's for the test.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.630
Your job is to do the shopping
and return within one day

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.340
without using your red eyes.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.480
But you'll share the responsibility
with a partner and go together.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.700
Choose someone carefully.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.700
Partner?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.320
I choose Pairo!

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.540
Don't you understand?

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.790
This is shopping for a huge amount of daily
goods for the clan and takes a lot of strength!

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.160
If you take Pairo with
the disabled eyes with you...

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.690
Even so, I'm fine with Pairo.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.510
If it's with him I
won't regret any result.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.910
Whatever.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.910
I did it!

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.720
Pairo, we can go together!

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.710
Am I really okay?

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.710
Of course!

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.130
It can't be anyone but you.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.700
Well then, I'm going to put
this medicine in your eyes.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:32.260
Once this medicine is in effect, if your eyes
go red even once during the next 24 hours,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:39.290
even if you managed to calm down your eyes
won't turn back for the remainings hours.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.490
If your eyes turn red in the middle of the day,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.550
you'll have to stop doing the
errands and return immediately.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.340
Well then, take the medicine now.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.340
Yes.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.770
Pairo, let me...

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.320
It's fine. I can search for it myself.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.220
As your partner, I'll
do what I can on my own.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.870
Found it!

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.870
Look out, you brat.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.050
You made a fucking mess.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.050
Pairo!

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.690
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.770
I'm fine. I just stumbled a little.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.090
Are you with that brat?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.310
Look, my important suit
is ruined with wine.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.310
What'cha gonna do about it?

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.310
You liars!

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.390
I was watching.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.300
It was you guys who-

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.570
Be prepared for
consequences if you talk.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.380
So, what were you saying?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.930
No, umm...

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.970
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.790
I don't need your apologies.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.790
Gimme money.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:40.790
What?!

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.790
Wait.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.150
Um, if it's just money...

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.670
We only have this much.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.670
That's...

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.090
<i>It's Pairo's savings...</i>

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.370
Hey, what's this?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.260
They're all one Jenny coins.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.670
You can't get shit with this pitiful sum.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.210
Bastard!

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.370
No, Kurapika!

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.600
Let's just apologise and
ask them to let us go.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.770
I'm sorry, please forgive us.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.260
I'm sorry. Please forgive us.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.170
I'm sorry.

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:25.290
I'm sorry...

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.940
Sorry, please forgive us.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.550
Just forgive them already.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.740
They're only children.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.520
Shut up. You picking a fight?

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.800
Here, Pairo.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.960
Thank you, Kurapika.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.970
You got it tough too.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.660
Looking after a cripple.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.080
Gotta suck to live like you.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.010
For real.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.580
You brat..!

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.020
Get up.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.320
Get up!

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.550
I'm telling you to get up!

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.840
Get up!

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.290
Forgive me...

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.490
Stop it, Kurapika!

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.790
Let me go, Pairo!

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.490
That's enough, just stop!

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.900
Let us go, we were just told to do this!

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.290
What?

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.530
What do you mean?!

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:02.260
Yesterday a weird pops
told us to anger you.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.310
An old man with pointy hair?

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.310
Y-yes!

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.800
It's grandpa!

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.400
About Pairo too?

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.830
Did the old man tell you
to insult Pairo's body too?

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.590
No, that was just in a whim...

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.790
Sorry.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.790
Forgive us-

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.440
As if that'd justify it!

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440
Kurapika!

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.220
Granny...

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.500
A red-eyed monster!

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.660
What's with that colour?

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.410
I've never seen eyes like that.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.950
What if he's a devil's envoy?

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.750
Are you for real?

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.010
Keep away, devil!

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.520
Get out from this city!

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520
Get out!

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.750
Maybe we shouldn't go to
the outside world after all.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.160
That's not true.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.160
But I ended up with those eyes.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.770
Kurapika, look.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.990
They're back to their normal colour!

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.620
What are those?

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.960
I switched it with grandpa's medicine.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.970
When I pretended to have dropped it.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.470
That time?

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.960
So, I...

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.180
You pass.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.070
After I had passed,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.610
I went on a journey to the outside world
to find a doctor who could fix Pairo's eyes.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.540
During those six weeks,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.410
the news of the Kuruta clan
getting mass murdered came out.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.000
Mass murdered...

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.660
All 128 forest dwellers were killed,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.590
and on the murder scene there was a
message the culprit supposedly left behind.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.090
"We reject no one."

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.260
"So don't take a thing from us."

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.080
So that was the Genei Ryodan...

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.030
Kurapika...

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.140
I can see something!

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:46.910
What?!

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.560
<i>Your beauty excites me.</i>

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.000
<i>To the point it makes me sick.</i>

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.000
I'm going up a staircase...

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.790
Kurapika.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.220
What do you see now?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.840
A sunset.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.640
Sunset?

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.830
It's not very far away.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.260
Could you be more specific?

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.590
We might be able to identify the place.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.590
Yeah...

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.450
Before the horizon...

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.750
A line of mountains...

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.730
There's a strange rocky
mountain with a round hole in it.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.740
What else?

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.910
A river...

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.250
I see a river on the right.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.990
Wait...

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.990
Someone appeared.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.990
What?

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.180
Is it the culprit?

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.290
What do they look like?

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.790
There's a piercing near his mouth and his
clothes are black and resemble a priest.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.550
Now, go to sleep.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.290
On his palm...

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.290
a spider tattoo!

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.330
A spider...

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.000
tattoo...

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.470
I can't see anymore.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.520
A spider tattoo is the
Genei Ryodan's symbol, right?

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.520
Moreover,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.090
the number on it was 4 just like Hisoka's.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.760
Why are there two number fours...

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.590
Does that mean they
changed Hisoka to a new #4?

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.590
Hold on.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.310
Getting Kurapika's eyes back comes first.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.660
Let's find a location with this
scenery and we'll find the guy.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.360
What's this? I mean...

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.470
It's so bad I don't understand anything.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.530
But it's alright! At times like this...

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.420
Let's use the information
site for Hunters!

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.500
The correct choice.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.500
What's that?

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.330
The search is ready.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.990
The results are too broad like this...

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.380
We need to narrow down
the conditions more...

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.950
What if you only display places that are
about 10 minutes away from our location?

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.790
That's right.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.950
Totoria district?

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.720
Is that man's headquarters
somewhere there?

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.730
Yeah...

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.780
This is still pretty broad but we have
no choice but search them one by one.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.470
With this amount of matches
it'll work out somehow!

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.470
I guess.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.480
I'd want to come with you but...

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.490
You stay here looking after Kurapika.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.410
Yeah, leave it to me.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.610
Killua, let's leave right away!

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.390
Yeah!

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.550
You're forgetting your Hunter's license!

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.210
You can hold onto it!

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.620
I guess I have no choice.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.170
Well then, here goes!

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.190
I'm counting on you!

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.730
I'll call you if something new comes up!

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.240
OK!

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.690
We'll definitely find the place!

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.690
Is everything visible from here
part of the Totori district?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.690
Yeah.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.260
Even if we go through the places
one by one it'll take two or three days.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.260
Let's hurry.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.140
I'll look from that town.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.300
Then I'll start from there.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.270
So, where should we reunite?

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.440
You see that clock tower
in the middle of that city?

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.440
Yeah.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.440
How about there at six tonight?

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440
Got it.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.160
Not here, huh...

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.830
This one's wrong too...

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.730
Amazing!

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.640
Thank you!

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.910
Look out!

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.560
Oh dear!

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.300
Are you okay?

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:17.940
Thank you.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.600
See you, kind misters!

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.490
Sorry 'bout that, lad.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.490
No worries!

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.570
Let me express my gratitude again.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.570
Thank you!

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.190
I'm Retz, a doll maker.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.390
I'm Gon.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.940
Your show just now was amazing!

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.210
It looked like the doll was alive.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.560
Thanks...

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.870
What's wrong?

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.250
Nothing.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.090
"Gon" is an interesting name.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.090
So is "Retz".

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.810
Is it?

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.290
They're both short and easy to remember.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.260
Since they're two syllables long.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.290
That's right!

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.530
Do you know this area well?

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.740
Pretty well, I guess...

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.220
I'm looking for a location...

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.220
Do you know this place?

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.490
Maybe I'll go back to Gon for now.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.060
Killua!

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.590
How did it go?

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.600
What about you?

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600
I couldn't find it.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.190
I see.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.190
Same here.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.190
I'll introduce you, Killua.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.990
This is Retz the doll maker.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.980
We met earlier and became friends.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.980
Nice to meet you.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.190
Friends?

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.790
Retz is amazing! The doll
looks like it's alive-

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.220
Rather than that,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.080
don't we have work to do?

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.590
That's right.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.790
I asked Retz about it too.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.940
He had a hunch of the place,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.020
so we searched together.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.250
We searched around quite a lot,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.900
but couldn't find anything today.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:40.900
Really?

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.900
But no worries!

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.670
He said he'll help me tomorrow, too.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:46.670
Umm...

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.840
It's getting late so I thought we'd
check the remaining locations tomorrow...

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.540
Sounds like a shady story.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.400
Gon. Why did you bring
someone like this along?

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.860
What?!

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.950
The "having a hunch" part
sounds suspicious too.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.340
You could be a pilferer or something.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340
Killua!

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.500
What's your problem?!

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.880
I'm helping because Gon asked me to!

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.800
Why are you so rude?!

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.870
Apologise!

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.290
Shut up!

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.010
Retz!

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.900
Are you alright?

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.290
Did you get hurt?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.930
Stop that already, Killua!

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.990
You...

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.440
could you be...

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.690
A girl?

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.290
A girl?!

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.290
It wasn't my intention
to fool you or anything.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.170
It's dangerous for a
girl to travel alone,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.110
so I pretend to be a
boy when I'm on tour.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.110
I see.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.110
That happens a lot anyway.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.390
Acting like you knew all along.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.090
You didn't know at first either.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.090
Shut up.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.530
You two are really close.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.970
That's enviable.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.830
Not really.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.790
So you travel all alone?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.100
My big brother is a doll maker too,

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.200
but I wanted to become
a professional one myself,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.170
so I'm practising with street performances
while travelling alone for now.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.550
So maybe this guy is my best friend.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.800
Could it be...

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.490
that that doll..?

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.460
I made him myself, of course!

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.490
That's amazing!

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.390
You'll definitely become
a great doll maker!

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.390
Thanks!

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.700
That doll has beautiful eyes.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.570
Gon and Killua too.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.520
Gon's eyes are thoroughly transparent.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.140
Killua's are tinged
with darkness, yet pure.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.410
Stop it. That's creepy.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.850
You're embarrassed, aren't you!

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.540
No way!

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.590
Making eyes for a doll
is the most difficult.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.790
Whether it lives or dies depends
on the quality of its eyes.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.990
If you manage to make a
doll with perfect eyes,

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.090
it will gain a soul.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.910
Or that's how they say.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.910
A soul?

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.390
This person...

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:32.750
Could she really..?

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.750
Killua.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.270
Is something wrong?

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.980
It's nothing.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.970
Alright, let's eat and
hit the bed for today.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.560
Woa, this is delicious!

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.690
That's mine!

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.620
Pairo...

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.290
I'll definitely find a
doctor who can cure your eyes.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.470
Then we'll watch the outside
world as much as we want together.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.890
I'm with you, Pairo.

00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.710
From now on and always...

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.710
Always!

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:19.540
Who's there?

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.550
You are..!

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.120
How lovely.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.710
The smell of antiseptics and your blood.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.550
Hisoka!

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.390
You fucker! What are you doing here?

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.910
Could you stay quiet?

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:38.390
It's alright.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.630
If that's what he wanted, Hisoka
could have killed me any time.

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.600
But he hasn't so he's
got no killing intention.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.370
Correct.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.410
Why did you come here?

00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.210
I thought I'd tell you about
the guy who took your eyes.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.210
What?!

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.340
That's..!

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.790
Uvogin?!

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.470
But Kurapika took him down!

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.660
What's going on?

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.820
Found you!

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.820
You're looking for the chain
bastard's eyes, aren't you?

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.700
How does he know?

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.870
Come down here!

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.650
Idiot!

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.240
As if!

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.040
Crap!

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040
No way!

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.040
Let's run!

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:15.870
Hurry!

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.610
<i>Big Bang...</i>

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.900
<i>...Impact!</i>

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.410
Are you okay, Retz?

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.360
Escape, Retz!

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:52.360
But...

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.120
Don't dawdle!

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120
Hurry!

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.200
Yeah...

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.200
Why has he revived?

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.600
I don't know but if he's
involved with Kurapika's eyes,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.100
we just gotta do it.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.100
Yeah.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.600
I sure can't get enough
of this sensation!

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.400
Let's go all out!

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.640
<i>First we gotta measure
the opponent's strength!</i>

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.270
<i>Intensify your aura on
the arms for protection.</i>

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.030
Ren!

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.110
He's crazy strong!

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.320
That's not just some muscle idiot!

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.380
Here I come!

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.260
That tickles.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.720
You flies!

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.500
He's coming!

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:08.500
<i>Rock Storm!</i>

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.180
Killua...

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.390
Gon...

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.480
Fighting him is...

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.490
impossible...

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.890
<i>Don't fight against
opponents you can't beat.</i>

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.840
This can't be all there is to you.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.070
First we gotta do
something about his punch.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.850
<i>Run.</i>

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.530
Are you listening to me, Killua?

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.960
Let's attack his right
arm simulatenously!

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.960
Got it!

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.070
His bones should
have shattered from that but...

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.290
<i>It won't work.</i>

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.290
<i>We really can't...</i>

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.290
<i>beat him.</i>

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.810
This is definitely the best!

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.050
You should run!

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.270
Now then...

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.920
About the time to finish things off!

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920
Hurry!

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.190
Drop dead!

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.030
You brats,

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.910
what are you doing having such
a hard time against a mere doll?

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.920
Nobunaga..!

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.920
Doll?

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.810
My body is made of steel.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.230
Your katana won't reach my core.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.140
Shut your trap, you fucking puppet.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.790
I can taste the joy of fighting
once more thanks to this.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:37.140
I'm instructed to kill
anyone who got on my way.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.500
Even if the opponent
was a former partner.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.490
I told you to shut your trap.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.790
En, huh?

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.730
Unfortunately it won't
have any effect on me.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.190
What's wrong?

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.490
You just gonna run?

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.880
You were strong back
when we fought as a team.

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.100
<i>Big Bang...</i>

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.210
<i>You never had such an
opening at this point.</i>

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.210
<i>Impact-</i>

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.450
Your powers would be
nothing without Uvo's eyes.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.850
I'm glad.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.660
To die by being cut by you-

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.590
I did tell you to shut your trap.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:49.270
You sure are making fun of
the former Ryodan members.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.590
You're there, aren't you?

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.590
Omokage.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.590
Omo...

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600
kage..?

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.790
<i>His name is Omokage. </i>

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.950
"Omokage"?

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.290
I told you, right?

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.890
Two or three years ago,

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.460
I joined the Ryodan by switching
with the guy who was #4.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.460
Yeah.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.730
That's the guy who stole your eyes.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:26.690
He's a Specialist who calls
himself the doll maker of gods.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.240
He sneaks his way into people's minds,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.520
and makes dolls according
to their innermost feelings.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.690
Dolls?

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.490
The dolls become servants that
strictly follow Omokage's orders.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.390
But even while being controlled by him,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.190
they won't lose memories
of their lifetime.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.860
Memories of their lifetime..?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.790
The dolls capture the
real ones' souls too.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:57.220
Therefore,

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:03.060
the dolls also have a will of their own
while they have to follow Omokage's orders.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.300
It seems he can't get
enough of such tragedy.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.470
So this Omokage person
directed us to a doll of Pairo,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.310
in order to steal Kurapika's eyes?

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.310
Probably.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.340
Since he's a collector.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.640
<i>For such a ridiculous hobby...</i>

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.520
<i>he used my best friend..!</i>

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.000
The Omokage I defeated in
order to become the new #4

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.840
was a doll of him.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.580
You bastard..!

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.490
You knew that and yet...

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.670
Why did I let him go alive?

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.210
Do you know what it means?

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.320
It'd be a waste to put an end to
such an entertaining guy right away.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.440
Your taste is awful as always.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.590
Why are you sharing
this information with us?

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.890
Because together with Gon,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.200
you're also precious unripe fruits.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.600
I won't allow you to get
snatched before you ripen.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.500
Stop saying creepy shit like that.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.990
Be careful.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.490
Omokage is a fearsome opponent.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.790
You asshole...

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.840
How dare you show your face to me?

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.290
Even though I brought
Uvo back to life...

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.330
what unfortunate words.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:38.990
I was expecting you to be grateful.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.870
Shithead..!

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.600
Anger is a sign of being alive.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:47.610
But...

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.360
The Injuu?

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.390
That son of a bitch...

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.440
He's even using Paku..!

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.300
Are you the one who
stole Kurapika's eyes?!

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300
If you are,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.860
give them back!

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.860
Gon!

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:18.790
Eventually,

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.830
I'll add your eyes to my collection too.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.450
Enjoy the short life you have left.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.450
Wait!

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.350
We are your opponents, brats.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.460
We are instructed to steal your eyes.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.890
Nen threads!

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.010
Enough of the shitty tricks!

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.310
Rest in peace now.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.880
What's that?

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.810
That fucking Omokage...

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.670
he dug up Uvo's grave
and stole his eyes.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.960
And he created a Paku
one on top of that.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.930
This means it's not over yet.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.660
Let's go.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.660
Sure.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.590
You seem to be after Omokage too, but...

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.670
you better not get on our way.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.820
Spiders should finish
off what spiders start.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.980
There it is!

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.840
Everything's fine, it's not broken.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:56.790
That's great, Retz!

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.290
Gon.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.290
Let's hurry and leave.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.410
Yeah...

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.500
But...

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.050
we should do something
about Retz's clothes...

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.690
Wonderful!

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.220
Perfection for the Heavens Angels!

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.970
Beautiful!

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.490
Very very excellent right?

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:35.790
It's been a long while since my
stylist's heart has been burning up!

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.790
You're lovely, mademoiselle.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.310
You're just like a doll.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580
Is there some problem?

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.690
Umm...

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:45.390
Not really...

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.980
Well then, take your time.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.000
Isn't this great?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.280
It suits you.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.290
It's a little embarrassing.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.480
I've never dressed like this before.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.790
Who cares about that.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:02.790
Just tell about that place
you've got a hunch of already.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.120
Shut up! I'll guide you there now.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.150
It'll be dangerous
again if you follow us,

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.650
so just tell us the place!

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.260
I'll be fine.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.270
You might end up dead!

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.270
You might turn like this!

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.110
That would be better than
nothing ever starting.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.680
I'm not living real everyday life.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:31.310
I've always wondered when the day
comes that I really start living.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:33.590
What are you talking about?

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.540
You don't... really live?

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.090
When I'm with you two,

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.810
I feel like something's about to start.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.600
Something is...

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.390
about to start..?

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:56.090
Gon.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:57.540
You got a moment?

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.310
Sorry, wait a second.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.060
<i>Soul Doll.</i>

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.610
What's wrong, Killua?

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.980
I really can't trust her after all.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.160
Is that so...

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.160
But you know...

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.070
But, what?

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.890
I feel like there's something
deep within Retz's heart.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.780
So I want to observe
her just a bit more.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:41.590
Don't blame me if she betrays us.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.630
<i>You will betray your friends.</i>

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:49.920
<i>I won't betray them!</i>

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.920
Killua!

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.080
Please. Can't you let me help you?

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.350
Aren't you two doing your best
to get your friend's eyes back?

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.480
I want to be of help for you.

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.480
As your friend.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:14.720
<i>As a friend...</i>

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.720
Please!

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.290
I'll turn back as soon
as I've guided you there.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.090
There's no problem with that, right?

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.090
Killua.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.770
It's not like we have other clues.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:26.700
Let's let her guide us.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.990
Fine.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.310
Well then, Retz! Take us there.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.310
Yes!

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.490
Huh?

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.390
Retz, what about your doll?

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:42.170
I left it for that shopkeeper
in case something happens again.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.420
Come on, this way.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.230
There it is.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:04.680
I see.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.830
It does seem correct.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.970
The scenery here fits
Kurapika's description.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:13.790
Yeah.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.320
Thank you, Retz.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.200
You don't need to come further.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.200
But..!

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.150
I came all this way, let's go together!

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.150
No.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:26.940
To be honest, you would get on our way.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.770
What?!

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.910
I even guided you all the way here!

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:31.910
Retz.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.660
Don't take it wrong,
that's not what we mean.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.260
We don't want there to be a
chance for you to get hurt.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.260
Got it?

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.630
Okay.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.110
This is... pretty nice.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.050
I've always pretended to be a boy,

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:55.040
so this is the first time
I've been treated this gently.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:56.040
Gon!

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.620
What're you doing? Let's go.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.000
I'll go now, Retz.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.290
Take care of yourself, Gon!

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.420
And maybe you too, Killua!

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.850
The scenery Kurapika saw was
from the upper floor, wasn't it?

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.320
Yeah.

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.820
Let's find a staircase.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:16.300
Wh...

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.300
Who's that?

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.930
You are..!

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.090
Big brother!

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.220
Why...

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.080
is he in a place like this..?

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.070
Calm down, Killua!

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.720
That's a doll!

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.020
I know.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.020
But...

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:54.890
Kil.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.300
Why won't you follow my warnings?

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:58.300
Why?

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.920
You disobeyed me and made friends.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.920
Kil.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.350
Even though I told you so many times

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:09.960
that you would only get
betrayed if you made friends.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.700
Or perhaps,

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.080
did you make friends
so you could betray them?

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.190
No...

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.190
Killua!

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.190
Fine.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.450
I'll stop expecting anything of you.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.300
My eyes don't see you anymore.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.750
Because...

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:31.240
my eyes...

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.130
show nothing but darkness.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.350
So,

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:39.240
I was told to take your eyes.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.370
Like I'd let you!

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:52.050
Kil.

00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:56.890
You can't go against me.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:57.890
So many times...

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:01.150
I've told you so many times.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.520
Not to fight an opponent
you can't beat.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.890
Killua, get a hold of yourself...

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:14.290
Nuisance.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.290
You are.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:26.780
Shit!

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.390
Kil.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:32.390
I'll say it one more time.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:36.660
You can't go against me.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.500
Don't fight opponents you can't beat.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.470
You don't need friends.

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:54.220
If you make any you'll
only get betrayed.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.130
And one day,

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.970
you will...

00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:59.430
kill that friend.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.340
Shit!

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.340
Oh, he ran away.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.830
But that's fine.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.380
Running and leaving your
important friend behind

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.650
is the worst deed,

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.440
but that's the correct choice.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:22.450
Shut up! Be quiet!

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:29.080
It's just like I said.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.750
You're not qualified to make friends.

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.780
Fuck you!

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.830
Didn't I say you're a nuisance?

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:13.530
Gon!

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:14.330
Are you-

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:17.150
What a farce, Kil.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:20.910
At any rate,

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.140
you'll just betray your friend.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.460
I wouldn't..!

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.460
Then...

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:28.410
kill me.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:30.150
If you won't,

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.260
I'll kill this guy.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.260
What..?

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:35.780
Don't fall for it.

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.400
This is... just a doll!

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.130
Gon!

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:44.300
Come on, Kil.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.950
Hurry up and kill me.

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.190
Quickly.

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:51.190
Kill.

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.090
Me.

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.420
Kil!

00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.480
Come on.

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.590
Quickly.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:02.590
Kill.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.400
Me.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.400
Now.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.950
Killu...a...

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.660
<i>I can't...</i>

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.920
<i>My body won't move...</i>

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.510
You're fine that way.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.570
That's the correct choice.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:21.190
Don't fight opponents

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.190
you can't beat.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.420
Killua!

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.780
Stop iiiit!

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:39.110
Too naive.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.620
Gon..!

00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:59.790
Different from the instructions but,

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:01.590
this is good too.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.620
What wondrous eyes.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.820
The world looks dazzling.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.160
<i>What...</i>

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:10.940
<i>am I doing..?</i>

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:11.940
<i>Gon!</i>

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.190
Hang in there, Gon!

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.090
Retz?

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:18.870
That's right...

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880
Gon-

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.980
<i>At least...</i>

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.910
<i>I have to get Gon's eyes back.</i>

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.900
Give his eyes back!

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:34.490
That won't do, Kil.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:38.160
I was told to take these eyes with me.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.160
Cut the crap-

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:43.140
Bye.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.820
Gon, get a hold of yourself!

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:48.830
Gon!

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:50.990
I'm fine, Retz.

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:53.930
Retz...

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.710
<i>Don't blame me if she betrays us.</i>

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.910
<i>Aren't I the one who betrayed him?</i>

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:03.840
<i>When Uvogin attacked us...</i>

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.490
<i>and when big brother was
about to take my eyes...</i>

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:09.190
<i>Gon was protecting me..!</i>

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.880
<i>I am...</i>

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:15.170
<i>I'm just like big brother said.</i>

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.920
Killua! Where are you going?!

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.510
<i>I don't...</i>

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:28.130
<i>have the right to be Gon's friend..!</i>

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.460
<i>Gon's Hunter's license...</i>

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.810
<i>That reminds me...</i>

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.750
<i>it was in the Hunter exam</i>

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.570
<i>where I met him.</i>

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.840
<i>At first I just talked to him
because we were the same age but...</i>

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.140
<i>We had the same athletic skills,</i>

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.550
<i>even though I thought
he was a mere softy...</i>

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.530
<i>He was always so honest,</i>

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.290
<i>the exact opposite from me...</i>

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.740
<i>Before I knew,</i>

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:16.660
<i>he had become</i>

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.490
<i>an invaluable friend for me...</i>

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.250
<i>And yet I...</i>

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.240
<i>betrayed him...</i>

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.660
I'm really the worst.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.600
I don't care anymore.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.750
Killua!

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:15.690
Are you alright, Killua?

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.160
Gon...

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.850
How... did you get here...

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.980
I followed your scent.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.250
It was a little hard
because of the rain though.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.490
Why did you, for someone like me...

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.470
What are you saying, Killua?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.280
But I...

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.380
abandoned you and tried to escape...

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.920
You didn't abandon me.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.910
Didn't we fight together?

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:37.910
But..!

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.180
Besides,

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.180
if it was you I wouldn't
mind getting betrayed.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.150
I'll still believe in you!

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.070
<i>Gon...</i>

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:48.070
<i>You..!</i>

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:50.980
Got it.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.110
Where's Retz?

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.860
I just rushed after you
so I don't really know but,

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.740
she's probably gone
back to Omokage by now.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.550
From the moment I met her,

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:07.070
there was something I had a hunch of.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.560
That Retz's eyes weren't her own.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.090
So, the owner of her eyes...

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.030
It's probably Omokage.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.100
Otherwise,

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.140
she wouldn't have been able to make
a doll of Illumi using your heart.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:21.000
Gon...

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.140
you even knew that..?

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:23.680
No,

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.690
there are still things
I don't understand, too.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.360
But now I know where Omokage is.

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.230
We can follow the Nen in
my eyes to track him down.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.230
Don't tell me...

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.790
that's why you let your own eyes..?

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.430
Why'd you do something so reckless?!

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.430
I know right!

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:45.930
Are you really okay, Gon?

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:46.930
Leorio...

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:47.930
Kurapika..!

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:49.600
How did you find us?

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:53.180
We used the GPS function on Gon's phone.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.180
Gon!

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.280
I can't believe you...
Why did you go this far?

01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:58.890
It wasn't a big deal!

01:03:58.890 --> 01:03:59.890
Since we're friends!

01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:05.350
I really have amazing companions...

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.980
It's too early for thanking us.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.250
Right, Gon?

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.310
Let's go, everyone!
I'll guide us there.

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:16.230
It's the real deal from here on.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:17.590
Damn right.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.740
Let's go kick his ass!

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.840
So beautiful.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.200
The world seen through
these eyes truly is dazzling.

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.780
These are quite impressive eyes.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:40.350
However,

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.300
unfortunately, Retz...

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:44.460
They won't fit you.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:49.080
But, they are suitable for my collection.

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.780
Brother... Let's stop
doing this already...

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.790
Retz...

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:57.790
What's wrong?

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.080
I'm doing this all for your sake.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.550
I never asked for that.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:15.860
It's all thanks to you that I
could become the doll maker of gods.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.950
I need human eyes to
bring my dolls to life.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.220
You know that, don't you?

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:33.340
I was able to reach these results
because you became my first victim.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.680
I was still inexperienced back then,

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:43.340
so you ended up losing your eyes.
I'm truly sorry about that, Retz.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:48.040
Isn't that why I
brought you back to life,

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.080
and look for eyes that fit you?

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.800
I don't need them.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.960
Please return Gon's eyes.

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.570
Aren't you stubborn now.

01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.730
I can't force you.

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:05.690
Everything other than my orders
is of your own will after all.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.590
We have visitors.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.740
I'll have you return my eyes.

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:16.580
<i>Eyeball Steal.</i>

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.200
They're definitely here.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.980
Stealing the eyes back from
Omokage is gonna be tough.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.540
What're we gonna do?

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.390
Gon and Kurapika are blind.

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.120
Will we take them back by the two of us?

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:53.590
I'm fine.

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:56.070
I can use Nen to fight when needed.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.190
Yeah.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.460
Since he's a dangerous opponent,

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.920
we won't win without
combining all our strength.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.750
I knew you'd say that.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.760
Alright!

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.770
Shall we go?

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:08.770
Yes!

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.970
I can't sense anyone's presence.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.560
Welcome...

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.800
to my doll mansion!

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.600
<i>So he used Zetsu too.</i>

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.580
Are you Omokage?

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:54.280
Answer me!

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.060
Were you a member of the Spiders

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.440
back when they attacked the Kuruta clan?

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.060
Pairo would know that.

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:09.840
Omokage! It's you
bastard I'm asking from!

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.760
It was splendid.

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.720
I remember it like yesterday.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.240
The warmth of the Kuruta clan's spirit.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.500
And...

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.550
the warmth of that fresh blood!

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:24.550
Asshole..!

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:29.090
Do you have other red
eyes besides mine?!

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.690
Unfortunately yours are the only ones.

01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:36.060
And those are Pairo's right now, though.

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:37.940
Behold!

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:40.140
Pairo's delicate body with

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.390
Kurapika's passionate eyes.

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:44.550
And,

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.530
Illumi's madness with

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.140
Gon's honest eyes.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:54.100
These conflicting elements
can only be combined

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.910
as dolls.

01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:57.590
You barbarian..!

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:59.650
Is Retz there too?

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:06.320
She sprouted my love for dolls.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.540
My precious little sister.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.830
Sister..?

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:12.900
No, rather...

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.380
now she's the creation of
me, the doll maker of gods...

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.470
a living doll.

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:20.910
Retz...

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.170
If you pity Retz,

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.560
you should hand over
even more eyes for her.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.340
Doing that wouldn't make her happy!

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.380
She has obtained eternal life.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.420
If she only lives for your comfort,

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.680
she'll never be truly alive!

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.750
Pairo is the same!

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.970
Pops, hurry up and give
Kurapika and Gon's eyes back!

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.100
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.420
I didn't give you
hints how to reach here

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.790
so I'd give them back,

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.400
but to receive yours.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:00.400
Killua.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.290
Leorio.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.280
Your eyes too shall be mine!

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.790
This is the stage.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.370
You humans are the actors.

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:13.970
Now awaken,

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.150
my dolls!

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.280
Perform for me!

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:33.230
Here they come.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.240
Yes.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:37.590
We won't lose this time, Killua.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.590
Yeah.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.720
Good for you for
having made new friends.

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:47.190
But I thought I was
Kurapika's only friend.

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:50.260
You're not Pairo!

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.120
The real Pairo is dead!

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:53.120
Yes.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.650
Yet I am alive.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:11:00.150
Controlled by a strong
will I can't disobey.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.880
I need to get your friends' eyes too.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.640
I won't let you!

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.990
Of course.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.650
But you know.

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:13.000
I'm ordered to kill anyone on the way.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.390
Though I don't want to do it.

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:28.410
Leorio!

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:32.800
Can I...

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.660
live as Pairo?

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.840
You're nothing but the
Pairo in my memories!

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.290
But I remember everything.

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:45.170
About grandpa,

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.680
and about Kurapika's mother and father.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.900
Even if you died,

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.580
you'd definitely get revived as a doll.

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:03.990
And then we could live together.

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.460
Just like in the old days.

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:09.510
Bastard..!

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.870
Kurapika, get a hold of yourself!

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.590
You have to accept your loved ones'
deaths or you can't move forward!

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:29.090
That's how we both got
over our friends' deaths!

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:31.440
Pairo might have been your best friend,

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.620
but you have us now!

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.050
Live in the present, Kurapika!

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.180
Stop getting in the way.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.190
What-

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.160
Leorio!

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:46.870
We're together, right, Kurapika?

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:49.600
From now on and forever.

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:51.650
Forever...

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.220
Forgive me, Leorio.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.440
I won't hesitate anymore.

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:19.160
He's coming.

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:52.620
Gon!

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.720
Are you alright, Gon?!

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:57.290
Kil.

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:59.530
You still don't understand?

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.360
You are a puppet of
darkness without passion.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.790
That's not true!

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.470
Killua isn't some puppet!

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:10.470
Gon...

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:15.290
The only moment when
you feel real happiness

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.700
is when killing people.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.750
Wrong!

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:25.040
You don't know shit about Killua!

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.890
Even if you made friends,

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:34.290
you'd end up wanting to kill them.

01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:38.180
Since you're a murderer by heart.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.020
Killua's not a murderer.

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.220
He's my most precious friend!

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.730
Gon...

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.590
You can fight!

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.720
When you're with me
we can do it together!

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720
Yeah!

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.590
<i>I also...</i>

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:03.690
<i>trust Gon completely!</i>

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:07.590
Don't fight opponents you can't beat.

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:09.630
I taught you so.

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:39.490
Let's go! Killua!

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:40.490
Yeah!

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:11.790
Gon!

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.060
We did it!

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:31.780
Kurapika.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.220
Was the outside world...

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.990
fun?

01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:41.790
What's wrong?

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:45.590
There were lots of sad
and painful things there,

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:49.630
but I gained friends who share it all.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.530
Is that so.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.530
I'm glad.

01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:56.380
Pairo!

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.490
Thank you, Leorio.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.740
Don't mention it.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.590
A tragedy has the sweet taste of honey.

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:25.200
Sadness is the sign of being alive.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.790
It's all thanks to
the dolls I've created

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:30.790
that you are blessed
to get a taste of it.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.790
Be grateful.

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:35.910
You can't escape anymore.

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:36.910
Come down here!

01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:41.550
Do you want to know
why I joined the Spiders?

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:46.500
Because I wanted dolls of the Spiders.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.000
The reason I left was...

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.790
that I had completed the dolls I wanted!

01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:07.000
The Genei Ryodan!

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.290
My favourite sextet.

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:12.790
Plus...

01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.250
Kuroro..!

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:19.530
There's no way you could beat them.

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.910
This is bad!

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.990
<i>Indoor Fish.</i>

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.430
Why are you having such
a hard time against dolls?

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:02.430
Hisoka!

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.290
Rather than beating
the dolls one by one,

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:08.490
blocking Omokage's Nen would be faster.

01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:13.010
Playing a knight in a
shining armour, Hisoka?

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:17.090
I'll add you to my collection too.

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:18.290
Omokage!

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:20.750
I won't allow you to do that anymore!

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.590
I'm not asking for your permission.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:28.290
You don't have the right
to dishonour the deceased!

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:30.790
I will clear Pairo's heart.

01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:33.310
Retz is sad too!

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.310
Retz?

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:38.090
That's right! Retz is in pain!

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:40.690
Don't you understand that?!

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:41.690
Silence!

01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:44.720
What would you brats understand?

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.790
I don't care about your reason!

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:50.200
All you'll do is become
part of my collection.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:53.870
As if you'd understand

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:55.980
the beauty of these dolls!

01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:00.370
<i>Emperor Time.</i>

01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.540
Fine. I'll be your opponent.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.230
<i>Doll Catcher!</i>

01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:30.080
Now. Shall we begin?

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.100
<i>Double Machine Gun!</i>

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:41.290
Then, the one playing with me will be...

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.540
you!

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:06.590
If it's one against three,
even dolls might be some fun.

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:14.440
When I fuse with the dolls,
I can use their Nen abilities!

01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:17.160
Now..!

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.650
<i>Chain Jail!</i>

01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:31.190
I know about this.

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:33.770
It's the Nen ability that
defeated Uvogin, right?

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:34.770
Let's go!

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:55.300
Shit! He'll get us at this rate!

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.290
Our only chance to win
is Kurapika's Chain Jail!

01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:00.490
But I can't get close to him!

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:01.650
Don't worry!

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.650
Me and Killua will
do something about it!

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:05.790
How?

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:11.090
Let's combine our Nen and
become a shield for Kurapika!

01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:12.090
Gon...

01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:13.430
Combine your Nen?

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.300
If it's with Killua, we can do it!

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.190
Yeah!

01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:19.820
If it's with Gon, I can do it!

01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:23.390
Don't forget about me!

01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:25.420
Alright. Let's do it!

01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:58.660
Thanks for the treat.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.290
Well then...

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.020
only you left?

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.120
<i>Bungee Gum!</i>

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:37.590
In the end, without a soul
this is as good as you get.

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:39.570
How disappointing.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.840
I'm finished here.

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.190
Fuck you, Hisoka..!

01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:54.820
How dare you do that to my dolls!

01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.290
Let's go, Killua!

01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:00.290
Yeah!

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:05.060
Gooo!

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:08.510
Come!

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.210
Listen, humans! I'll crush
you like rotten apples!

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:21.170
Go drown in your own lukewarm blood!

01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:41.390
<i>Chain...</i>

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:42.390
<i>...Jail!</i>

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.490
It worked!

01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.840
Now he's in a Zetsu state!

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:11.490
I decided that this ability
only works on the Spiders.

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:17.420
But since you were involved in attacking
the Kuruta clan and have the Spider tattoo,

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.240
I consider you a Spider too.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.550
You think you've got
me captured like this?

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:24.550
Quiet!

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.450
<i>Judgment Chain!</i>

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.710
I'll set you a condition.

01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:36.050
If you obey it, I'll release you.

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.610
What are you planning
to do if I disobey?

01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:45.650
This chain inserted in
you will crush your heart.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:55.350
Why can't you understand
the brilliance of my dolls?

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.540
On top of gaining an eternal life,

01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.790
your beautiful eyes
would continue to live.

01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:03.220
Don't you find that wonderful?

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:06.790
Pairo didn't wish for anything such!

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:09.790
You only forced your
crooked will on him!

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:10.990
That's right!

01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:15.790
You only let Retz keep suffering
for the sake of your own desire!

01:26:16.290 --> 01:26:17.590
Retz?

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.530
"Suffering"?

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:22.680
She doesn't want anyone's eyes!

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:24.550
Shut up.

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:25.550
Shut up, shut up!

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.620
Give up already, Omokage.

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:33.550
I'm prohibiting you from using your
Nen ability ever again hereafter!

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.390
So... I can't create dolls anymore?

01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:42.740
You choose whether you say yes or no.

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:51.750
If I can't make dolls,
I'm as good as dead.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:53.890
But,

01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:56.490
don't think you've won with this.

01:26:56.490 --> 01:27:01.790
Even if I died, the
dolls will stay alive.

01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:04.170
And they'll kill you.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.450
My answer is

01:27:06.450 --> 01:27:08.330
<i>no!</i>

01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:09.870
Then go ahead and die!

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:17.710
Killua?!

01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:21.660
Kurapika shouldn't kill any more people.

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.750
I'm fine doing the dirty work.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:24.830
Cut that out!

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:27.410
I don't want you to kill anyone for me-

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.490
The only thing I can do

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:31.860
is this much.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.680
Retz!

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.990
Retz...

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:47.090
why...

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:48.820
me..?

01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:54.190
Becuse if I was alive, I would
definitely have done this.

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:57.590
What are you saying, Retz?

01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:00.860
You have an eternal life...

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.860
No.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.830
Brother.

01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:07.290
You aren't...

01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:09.570
a doll maker of gods at all.

01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:22.090
a mistake...

01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:31.060
To the filthy humans that
live like rotten garbage...

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.350
death.

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:39.480
<i>Ripper Cyclotron!</i>

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.830
Be it dolls or whatever...
this isn't very pleasant.

01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:10.550
The ones beating your asses...

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.980
will be us.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:16.630
We won't let the chain
bastard touch the dolls.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.260
If possible, I'd want to
finish you off right now.

01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:31.860
Cut the crap.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.860
We can't kill the chain bastard since his
chain is still wrapped around Danchou's heart.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.390
You guys knew about it too, didn't you?

01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:45.640
It's agonising but we
can't do anything for now.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.260
You selfish fuckers!

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:50.110
I won't just let you out
of the leash like this!

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120
Kurapika!

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.030
He used too much of his Nen!

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.850
We'll definitely settle this
once you're done with Danchou.

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:06.660
We'll let you taste suffering worse
than Hell when that time comes.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.340
Remember that.

01:30:11.170 --> 01:30:13.450
You too, Hisoka.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.050
What an honour.

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.730
Kurapika, are you alright?

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.570
I'm just a little tired.

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:43.870
Retz!

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.910
I'll return with my brother.

01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.850
To the memories.

01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:54.850
Retz...

01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:00.790
Gon, Killua, thank you.

01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:05.480
Thanks to you two, I can
finally really live.

01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:09.690
<i>Really live..?</i>

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.690
Retz..!

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:32.120
What the hell?

01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:49.970
It's better this way.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:55.900
Memories are something
to shut inside your heart.

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:00.680
"Really live", huh...

01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:04.730
What did she mean by "real"?

01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:09.330
Wouldn't that be
living the way you want?

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:13.290
Like you want to become
a doctor, right, Leorio?

01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:16.090
I'll find my companions' eyes.

01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:17.970
That's where everything starts.

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.880
I'll meet my dad!

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.660
I will...

01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:27.330
<i>I... don't have anything.</i>

01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:30.460
You should be by my side.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.140
I want to be with you.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.350
I guess I have no choice.

01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:42.360
<i>For now, I'll be by Gon's side...</i>

01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:45.040
<i>That's where it'll start...</i>

01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:46.600
<i>my reality.</i>

01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:05.390
Gon, Killua, Leorio.

01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:07.190
Let me thank you one more time.

01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:08.490
I'm indebted to you.

01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:10.680
Don't be so formal!

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.090
Of course we'd do this much.

01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:16.190
From now on too, just call
us when you need help.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:18.210
Since we're friends!

01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:20.410
Thank you.

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:22.640
Well then!

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.090
Someday, again..!
