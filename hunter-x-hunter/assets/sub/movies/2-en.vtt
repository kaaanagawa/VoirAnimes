00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.900
This hate I feel...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.590
I will never forget!

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.240

darkness will survive.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.070
Darkness you say?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.210
I will send you rest in peace, you and your darkness

Present

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.690
Impossible...

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.690
This is not poss-

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.730
What are they?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.150
The organization of Hunters!

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.380
We need to contact-

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.160
It's time.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.330
It is time for revenge.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.770
I'm talking to you, who hate the organization of Hunters.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.840
The anger that you wear against those who inflicted this enclosure to you,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.890
your aversion,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.330
your hatred...

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.940
All these feelings that you feel,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.750
release them!

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.890
The shade is made to rule over the light.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.280
This is for you!

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.480
One for me too!

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.430
Well, thank you and see you soon!

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.070
Too good !!

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.800
Ho!

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.760
Sorry!

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.800
Ha!

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.390
Hoo...

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.600
Ho ..

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.370
Here!

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.010
Ho! Thank you!

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.460
Bye-bye!

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.960
Well, it's been a while...

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.960
I forgot what it was a city!

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.700
 Of course it's been so long that we are in the jungle...

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.780
There was a lot of weird creatures!

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.190
A city is a city,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.520
but you can see all sorts of strange creatures...

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.480
Hmm?

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.780
Hee!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.070
Princess...

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.820
To knock on people like that

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.690
and to put it like that,
you don't find it rude?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.760
Do not falsely accuse us please...

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.400
We barely grazed...

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.990
What !?

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.270
You have guts to dare to challenge me!

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.680
If you don't understand when I speak to you with words,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.160
I have to explain to you with my fists!

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.270
Fucker!!

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.840
Osu!

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.110
Thank you very much!

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.120
How can we thank you...

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.790
Accept this.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.250
This is out of the question!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.200
It is quite natural to do what I did.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.540
Apologize.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.300
Zushi!

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.010
Gon!

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.750
Killua!

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.940
Long time no see!

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.230
Long time no see!

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.100
Osu!

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.970
Hello, Gon, Killua!

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.920
You look well!

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.720
Wing-san! Cookie!

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.280
Biscuit?

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.140
So this is "Wing-san"

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.760
and I'm just "Cookie"?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.820
What rudeness!

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.090
Well, you know...

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.320
This is yourself who told us that "Cookie" was enough.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.140
You have not changed at all, is it Gon!

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.580
Incidentally, you either...

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.930
You are also neglected as usual...

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.460
Hey?

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.500
No...

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.690
Put ​​your shirt into your pants!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.690
It makes me nostalgic  Do not you?

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.560
Yeah.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.090
It brings back memories.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.600
Celestial Tower!

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.710
To all the fighters from around the world,

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.820
thank you for waiting!

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.610
In this celestial tower,

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.460
in a few moments, the biggest competition

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.680
of World of Martial Arts, Battle Olympia, will begin!

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.760
Of course, all matches will be

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.890
broadcasted live on TV and radio.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.290
Only a few lucky spectators

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.980
who received a VIP ticket will

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.820
attend directly to matches.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.560
I'm so jealous!

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.270
Many leaders and officials

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.440
who wanted to see with their own eyes the fights

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.790
are also present.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.190
Neon, what a pity!

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.750
It's a shame, but...

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.600
From what I was told,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.370
your father is ill.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.820
I really wanted to meet him.
This is regrettable.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.400
Thank you.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.700
Well, I apologize.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.140
Over here, over here!

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.190
As you can see,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.000
The more floor we go, the more opponents are stronger,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.530
this Battle Olympia

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.900
is a tournament organised by the floor masters

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.050
level 230 to 250.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.520
Oh by the way,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.730
you have not managed to meet Jin isn't it?

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.450
Indeed.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.420
But I met Kaito!

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.600
I even introduced him Kirua!

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.690
I was really happy!

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.340
I'm glad to hear it!

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.160
When we finish watching the <i>Battle Olympia</ i>,</i>

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.040
we will find it.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.980
And now,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.480
participants come into play!

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.000
They're coming!

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.240
All participants will enter.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.500
Zushi is there, impressive!

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.680
Incredible, it has become a floor master!

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.690
Because he never stopped training.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.520
The <i>Ki</ i> that emerges is awesome!</i>

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.560
So he's the opponent of Zushi...

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.370
We can't count the number of wrestlers he crushed,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.680
and the same for the referees !?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.740
No problem!

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.530
Zushi

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.110
is strong!

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.030
I wonder how much he became strong.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.050
Wing-san, thank you for inviting us!

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.630
're Welcome!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.460
There is also another surprise guest...

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.510
Ho?

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.360
I said that we should offer medical coach Zushi to come...

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.060
Looks like I'm late!

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.230
What's the game where plays Zushi...

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.690
Looks like Gon and company come too.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.520
I want to show them my Nen quickly!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.510
Ai-e!

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.100
This is dangerous !

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.460
Close this!

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.980
If a kid gets sucked,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.970
how do we do it?

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.720
Huh?

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.740
What do we do?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.850
Nothing, here to be killed.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.690
Okay.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.530
This kind of morons can't be a Hunter...

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.690
They are all gathered.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.000
Now we will choose which is the most powerful of the 21 floor masters here today!

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.410
On this historic day,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.950
a man of tradition makes us the honor of coming.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.940
The President of the Hunter organization, Mr. Netero!

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.980
This is Netero-san!

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.890
The old made the trip?

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.800
Hmm...

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.860
To introduce myself to floor masters in the tournament <i>Battle Olympia</i> :

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.360
I am Netero, president of the organization Hunters.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.610
Stop chatting!

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.090
In this regard, I would like to tell you that...

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.260
For Netero is a very serious speech.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
This is that it is an official event!

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.470
Win a battle and rise to the top means

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.420
the same to enjoy the solitude.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.260
When a battle ends and there is a winner and a loser,

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.960
I'm away for a minute.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.940
this is the end for one of the two

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.770
And difficulties encountered so far are immediately relegated to the past.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.430
Okay.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.750
There are still before my eyes, but a vast empty desert.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.480
When something like this happens,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.160
we can ask the utility to determine who is the strongest.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.760
Is that what we have done so far really make sense?

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.050
We may have lost sight of our primary objective.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.990
Ah?

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.570
Ah?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.820
Finally, have fun!

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.020
What?

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.960
Huh?

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.770
It's over?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.910
He ended it?

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.230
It looks more like the President!

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.290
What is this?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.280
Isn't it?

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.690
You have heard what the president said !?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.370
His message is he come to you?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.140
Let's have fun!

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.800
Let's enjoy this moment, in this room,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.280
here is the message of the President!

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.710
On this,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.170
let's start the show

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.030
dancing mascots Battle Olympia!

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.230
It's Show Time!

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.530
To brighten the banquet of our fighters,

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.000
fairy spirits come into play.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.540
We can feel the heat

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.120
their iris glass.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.120
Gon. Come see the old during this time.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.970
Yes !

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.840
"Have fun"...

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.510
Rengoku,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.650
you are strong.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.460
We'll meet at Nirvana.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.190
Go.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.750
And if we had fun...

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.570
President!

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.390
What made you stop your speech presentation in the middle?

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.980
I asked you to make a good speech intr...

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.440
Here monitoring station at the entrance of the elevator.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.090
Childrens ordered me to let you meet you,

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.660
- Ah, hell, stop that! Hold on!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.650
- Come on, it's good...

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.530
This is good, this is good.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.330
It's been a while since I have not seen the old.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.490
I wonder if we ca manage to steal the ball today...

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.670
Ah... You have made good progress!

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.850
Hold it!

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.050
You drink tea in my room?

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.230
It is hard...

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.730
Good luck!

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.500
Say, Kurapika!

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.300
Huh? Kurapika?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.070
Welcome.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.770
Why have you brought me?

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.990
This year we are entitled to the very poor participants... I'm disappointed.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.210
I was free and then...

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.730
I do not intend to help you pass the time.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.070
Also colder than your usual, isn't it...

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.620
You want to make a house of cards with me?

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.580
If you have nothing to say to me, allow me to retire.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.670
If you are here,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.090
Gon and his friends also...

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.390
I know.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.150
They have not contacted me.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.600
I always work alone.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:24.990
Hmm.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.100
What's the problem bastard!

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.600
This hasn't started yet?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.390
I can't wait to stretch my legs.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.520
They are ready !?

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.620
Huh?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.800
The first big fight can finally begin!

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.780
Here, the fighters make their appearance.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.670
What kind of confrontation will they give us?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.280
Osu!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.840
What you got now?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.540
Hey, asshole, are you listening to me or not?

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.680
Argh...

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.730
I finished.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.200
No problems at all here either.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.710
Eater machines!

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.020
The electricity generated at the top of the tower

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.000
is then distributed to each floor so.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.200
Protection lifts unlocked.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.150
Taking control of the system...

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.920
End of process.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.500
It was awful!

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.280
This is not because you think of something you have to do it.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.360
It's you who could not stop to throw <i>Risky Dice</i> !

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
This is my problem.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.280
I see I see.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.660
Netero-san.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.590
What, grandfather?

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.040
First game :

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.780
Zushi against Kanjiru!

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.340
A historical weight difference.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.820
An ultra-heavy weight class against a mosquito.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.000
Zushi suddenly began

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.030
to win many victories!

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.030
As for Kanjiru 

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.660
Oh!

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.530
Hmm?

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.790
What's going on?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.740
This is not Kanjiru!

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.800
The man who came out of this coat?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.580
Who is he?

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.630
So this is the Celestial Tower.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.940
Not bad.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.160
Well, it's broken or what?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.100
Hurry up to put the picture!

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.130
They are annoying.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.780
Oh! What is that?

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.890
The situation here... gas!

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.950
Something happened Netero-san?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.190
<i>This aura... !</i>

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.940
59...

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.160
58...

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.170
57...

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.080
 <i>Non... </i>

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.820
<i> But this time... </ i></i>

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.210
54...

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.860
53...

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.840
I'm sure I killed him with my hands!

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.840
52...

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.210
51...

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:07.920
... 50

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.790
You !?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.060
Ecstasy of the shade!

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.060
Onbasara

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.380
Netero-san!

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.590
Let's go...

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.330
That we can lock me in such a cage,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.080
is that I'd become senile?

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.030
We should help him!

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.960
Do not touch!

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.460
But what is this thing?

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.960
This is the oath under the conditions dictated by the darkness.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.240
What's going on?

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.820
What is this?

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.520
I can not contact Kurapika?

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.090
Arriving late is not it?

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.990
Stop!

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.560
I have nothing to do with it!

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.830
Hey, what's going on here?

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.210
What are the floor masters doing !?

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.200
It was easy.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.020
Do you think I'm a coward?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.100
No.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.820
You can use weapons, it doesn't bother me!

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.790
If you attack fighters from behind without honor,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.290
you aren't an opponent for me.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.390
This person has to sacrifice his life

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.810
to seal my <i>Nen</i>.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.720
It means

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.490
you can not use your <i>Nen</i>?

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.860
How to...

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.930
Do not try to help me stupidly.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.870
If we do it wrong, everyone will be killed.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.460
Why?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.620
Why did we not realize that these types approached?

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.490
It's true!

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.140
Even if they use the <i>Zetsu</i>, it can be felt with the <i>En</i>!

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.720
If the forces of darkness are used to conceal its presence,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.270
any detection using <i>En</i> is useless.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.890
But what is these "darknesses" in the end?

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.030
Gon?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.470


00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.470


00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.470
On

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.240
There is a school of thought that differs from <i>Nen</i>

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.470
 Nen

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.730
based on a deep hatred.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.100
A  long time ago, I thought I had buried this doctrine, however...

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.400
At the same time this man.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.350
You finally decide to leave?

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.840
That's it?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.470
What they are weak.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.960
However...

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.630
A nudge?

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.840
I am a little amused.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.700
Spectators, look!

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.150
Zushi!

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.660
He is in charge?

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.500
How could you do that to Zushi...

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.670
You'll pay for this!

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.500
Pay him ?

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.940
Hooo that sucks!

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.420
Gon?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.340
Looks like it won't work here either.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.990
The safety control room

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.490
is in the 230th floor, I think.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.980
At least there is no risk to lose sight of those two.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.920
Someone just passed the wall of the 50th floor!

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.600
Intercept him immediately.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.230
The hate of those days are gone...

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.540
Has she brought you back to life in another appearance?

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.210
But you...

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.470
are wearig the ring of Jed, aren't you ?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.710
You see him, hunters?

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.640
Do not move.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.720
This is not only the hostages around the ring, Netero is also in danger.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.280
Is that okay?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.560
Gon and Kirua ?

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.500
No need to worry about these two!

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.170
But...

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.000
For Netero...

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.380
<i>These types...</i>

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.250
<i>What are they</i>

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.530
We are on the 50th floor?

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.100
Looks like there is one person.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.340
During the tournament <i>Battle Olympia</i>,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.260
the floor would be denied access?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.140
Say, Gon,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.120
what is this darkness?

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.650
What are these guys?

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.990
They will pay!

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.100
To put ​​Zushi and Netero-san in this state...

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.040
They will pay me!

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.120
Yes I do.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.040
Live from the scene

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.850
one after another, war chariots of the government army arrive.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.170
They are extremely numerous.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.170
What happens, then,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.630
within the Celestial Tower?

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.820
Here is the organization of Hunters...

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.810
Yes, hello...

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.910
I can not answer you.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.510
Yes.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.780
This is why I can not answer your query.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.000
Ah...

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.470
Damn...

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.240
What is this thing?

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.190
Yes.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.200
I can not answer you...

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.470
Help us a bit!

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.330
A communication from their leader!

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.570
At last!

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.450
I relay it!

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.670
To theresponsibles of the organization of hunters.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.320
It's been a long time isn't it ?

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.180
We are "The Shadows".

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.450
We captured Netero, and we occupy the Celestial Tower.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.380
Tomorrow at dawn,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.790
we will execute Netero and the hostages.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.520
I never heard of these "shadows"...

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.540
Me neither.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.420
<i>The shadow</i>

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.810
<i> A dark section that once existed</i>

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.870
<i>They realized missions that military officials couldn't do.</i>

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.050
<i>However,</i>

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.130
<i>when their activities have become extremists,</i>

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.340
<i>President Netero was quick to act, </i>

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.430
<i>and it isn't only the writings of this time,</i>

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.550
<i>but also their existence that he sealed</i>

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.510
<i>Shadow is supposed to have been destroyed !</i>

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.550
What is your request?

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.520
Public disclosure

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.690
of <i>Dark Memory</i> that the organization of Hunters hold.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.440
Who are you !?

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.120
You have up to five hours.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.010
You have only 10 hours.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.690
Until then, I'll be here.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.310
With Netero, of course.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.920
Yes ?

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.790
This phone...

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.790
Yes?

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.530
This is the line of

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.240
the emergency communication government.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.290
This is the first time I see it ringing.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.750
This is to say...

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.210
Yes!

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.460
This is understood.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.980
I am truly sorry to leave you in this time of crisis, however...

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.440
I'm in the obligation to leave.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.490
This man is hopeless...

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.500
Who's them?

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.420
Seriously?

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.880
Looks like we don't have the choice, we have to fight!

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.020
We know

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:42.020
how the organization of hunters has blood on his hands.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.350
Hey! Free me!

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.290
What does it mean?

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.340
Help!

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.930
If it is money you want, I have all that you can wish!

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.370
You can call for help as much as you want

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.880
from the President of the Hunter organization, of course.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.610
I see.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.730
It reacts automatically by an attack

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.530
against anyone who tries to touch me?

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.780
Even after his death, it is still handled by the <i>On</i>...

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.530
Poor child.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.830
This brand !

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.540
This is the hallmark of the prison of <i>Kanan</i>.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.200
This is it.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.110
This is a descendant of the shade.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.350
She got locked in a detention center because of the Hunters organisation.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.350
Today, we no longer do this kind of stuff.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.180
I ...

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.960
gave the orders.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.960
I asked a hunter to keep this

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.730
whole secret history.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.130
This is hardly one example among many others.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.940
In order of all nations,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.730
where the shadow was secretly sentenced

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.480
aren't counted anymore.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.250
The <i>Dark Memory</i>

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.510
contains evidence of all this.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.740
You want to show it to the world?

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.920
But what does that mean?

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.960
<i>The Dark Memory</i> wasn't completely sealed?

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.050
Their leader was aware of their existence.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.000
Maybe it is

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.040
a descendant of Jed, who inherited the shade.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.640
We can not settle for a "maybe".

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.040
Disclose the <i>Dark Memory</i> could have implications for national security.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.650
It could even destroy the country!

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.650
A new world war could start.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.390
What are the Hunters organisation doing ?

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.450
Apologize.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.230
Yes?

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.120
I see.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:02.370
Yes.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.330
This is understood.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.810
There were informations about their leader.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.140
There is absolutely nothing.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.140
There is absolutely no track

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.070
concerning the presence of a potential parent of Jed.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.620
But in this case...

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.630
In this case...

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.460
Who is this guy ?!!

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.050
Ah, what band it was fierce!

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.690
We will eventually get to the 200th floor...

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.430
Just a little bit!

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.010
Looks like they are gone.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.500
Looks like it.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.410
Well,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.270
this place...

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.580
From the 200th floor,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.780
the use of any type of weapon is allowed.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.680
And as it is impossible to know when a weapon will break...

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.130
There is an access code?

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.550
With a little luck, you can open it with-

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.770
Yosh!

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.460
Sometimes you do not think...

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.870
What an awesome stock!

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.640
Kirua, I found something nice.

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.720
Tadaaam !

00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:29.100
What, they also sell this kinf of stuff?

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:31.440
Certainly

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.200
this is because I used it during a fight, right?

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.480
Well,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.470
I found a good feeling!

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.740
It makes me nostalgic everything...

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.770
But what are these guys?

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.080
Some like others seem to seek to come here...

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.170
However,

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.350
you are unable to reach far up here.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.270
<i>Gas ?</i>

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.470
How to tell, from earlier,

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.380
it seems that all our movements are anticipated...

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.160
We got stuck!

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:47.790
Gon, it's poison gas!

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.330
Yes !

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.810
This is not that kind of poison that will make me something but...

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.510
I can win!

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.140
I can win. I can win. I can win. I can win!

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.410
He says something ?

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.920
I feel it!

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.740
I feel it!

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.210
He's fast!

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.340
He dodged!

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.040
He dodged my attack!

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.410
I can not win?

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.630
I can not win!

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:24.930
What is this?

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.930
But hell...  This power

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:30.100
I'll get to the top floor of the floor masters!

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.940
Sweet...

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.380
What are these guys?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.400
Looks like it fights!

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.800
Say!

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.040
The martial art you used against the child.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.780
I remember seeing it once.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.490
Is it possible that you're

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.340
a descendant of the shadows?

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.770
This is it.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.950
Do not tell me that a child like you is aware of the existence of the shadow?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.480
She is so young that she has the-

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.430
Shut up!

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.990
The shadow descendants had withdrawn

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.930
deep in the mountains and had built a remote village isolated of all, right?

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.770
Yes.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.740
We lead a quiet life.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.950
However, the country

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.640
and Garcia did not accept our existence.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:50.510
There have persecuted us and forced to revolt,

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:55.460
and pretext to contain the clashes in the name of justice

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.690
they slaughtered us.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.040
Then,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.800
legally, via the organization of Hunters,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.630
he locked us in a detention center.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.080
Many of my companions

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.330
had to work endlessly.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.520
In a terrible environment,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.190
they could've just wait a tragic death.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.490
We will carry out our revenge.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.570
Using this person,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.760
Note: On = darkness

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.760
by the power of <i>On</i> !

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.520
The organization of Hunters

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.270
can not decide, it seems.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.310
No.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.840
I may be wrong.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.390
Fuck!

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.240
We've been detected.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.320
Note: No meanings.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.320
Ameiba!

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.500
What is this aura?

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.250
That's the <i>On</i> ?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.720
Hundred demons curse

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.720
Hyakkijuon

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.340
Rasetsu

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.740
Wha-

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.090
What is this monster!

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.940
This is bad!

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.210
This is it.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:35.350
I thought you were an avatar of darkness of yesteryear,

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.980
The hatred you have towards this world was too big and you have not been able to ascend to Nirvana,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.420
and feelings are not only take the form of your soul,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.730
they also took your body!

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.020
I never thought to see you again

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.720
in such a form.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.730
Jed !

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.980
It seems that there is movement.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.910
Something just fell!

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.610
The smoke is very dense, I can not see anything at all!

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.080
What is it?

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.300
The terrorist...

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.200
Dancing ball!

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.640
But what might be going on?

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:06.640
Ha!

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.480
Hmm, it feels good.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.920
Excuse me,

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.030
what may be your goal?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.690
I ended, Shura.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.200
Congratulations.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.190
However, you could have done less conspicuous.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.280
This is not even a warm up

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.300
against guys too low.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.700
And the other types, what are they?

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.710
Looks like they're fighting...

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:46.460
Hmm?

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.370
Hey, hey!

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.260
Show me too.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.530
Hey!

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.590
There is nothing to do with you...

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.380
I am sending you this.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.730
What a bunch of stubborn these guys!

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.870
I am strong! I am strong!

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.260
I can't...

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.870
What is this guy!

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.380
I can not finish?

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.370
No way!

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.680
This is the opponent of Zushi.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.620
Ah?

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.740
So what do we do?

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.810
Hold up!

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:24.990
Ah?

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.590
It's heavy...

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.660
Kirua, it should be easy for you.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.710
Stop saying anything!

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.880
If you not try, we'll never know...

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.190
What are the kids doing ?

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.770
Shura!

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.610
Let me fight these two!

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.630
By any means?

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.840
Yes,

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.480
by any means!

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.690
No way to get serious!

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:06.880
But at this rate, we'll be killed!

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.070
Yet he did not move until just now.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.400
Obviously, this is a trap.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.340
This is exactly what we need! 

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.520
Yeah, here we go!

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.380
I am strong!

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.830
I am strong!

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.290
I am strong?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:49.530
Men sucked into the darkness have a sad fate.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.810
You sold your soul to a demon treacherous.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.020
You are an organization of dogs that are only barking.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.370
The ten rules of hunters, 4th rule:

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:01.780
Those who call themselves Hunters

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.340
can only target another Hunter.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.640
Yo!

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.430
Despite everything you've killed your brothers in front of my eyes.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.990
You are...?

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.060
I will not let you go further!

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.630
<i>Battle Olympia...</i>

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.670
We will make trouble out of the ring.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.640
A transmitter types.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.370
There is an exception.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:30.870
Except for those who have committed

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:33.810
premeditated crimes

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.690
This is just an excuse for hunters!

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.320
This is...

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.060
This is good!

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.160
This is more like it!

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:45.500
After becoming a shadow, I saw the many hells of this world,

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.860
and I realized something.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.280
The hunters are evil.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.300
In order to achieve their desires,

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.860
they flatter the powerful  major countries.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.750
The <i>On</i>,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.810
is the strength of the weak and oppressed, so they can get revenge.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.250
Finally,

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.540
we meet.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.750
Hop here!

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.760
As expected,

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.110
it is not the same level as the others.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:17.590
Yeah!

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.400
Anyway,

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.200
this is why we will lose.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:33.680
We must go up here,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.210
to save Netero and others.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.610
You're funny, both.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.060
Yeah.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.160
Hey,

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.340
why are you doing this?

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.370
You can't understand...

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.510
The depth of our sorrow.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.730
Don't kill him.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.600
We were ordered to bring them back alive.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.820
They saw us!

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.020
Hey!

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.670
The kids flee.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.540
You may be able to bring this person in this world.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.920
Jed.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:31.550
Wind.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.870
Desert covered in blood. Hear our request.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.380
We hate this world.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.800
We curse it.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.870
We want power.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.980
Show yourself in front of us.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.680
We swear loyalty to you

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.120
and we promise to kill all the hunters.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:35.810
I swear.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:36.990
I swear.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.020
I have seen your hatred.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.800
I'll give you power

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.250
to eliminate hunters.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:03.350
We had a contract and sworn to achieve our revenge.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.760
I can't lose to the hunters.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.730
Oh.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.500
I don't care, anyway.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.270
Your attacks are always the same from earlier.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.160
You too.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.770
Do not compare me to you.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:30.340
Shit.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:37.580
Gon!

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.200
You're doing good.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:09.050
It was just.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.250
Gon, it comes from above!

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.760
You can do it when you put yours.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.250
<i>It looks like It was him who manipulates them.</i>

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.430
<i>It's not the type transmitter, but transformation</i>

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:47.470
<i>After receiving such a punch,</i>

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:49.550
<i>if he still manages to stand,</i>

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.020
<i>that means he is also building type ?</i>

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.230
I don't understand.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.370
<i>Why is it that there are no cables for the elevator inside</i>

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.100
Even beating you,

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.220
looks like you can continue to control the security program.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.070
You are able to control the entire security system of the celestial tower.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.860
A n user of type manipulation.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.220
That means I'll have to kill you

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:31.130
to restart the system that you paralyzed.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.150
With your limited use <i>Nen</i> capacity,

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.290
you're wrong if you think you can understand the depth of <i>On</i>.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.940
I've never heard of <i>On</i>

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.960
but I understood something fighting with you.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.670
Ah?

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.400
We see this technique to your melee,

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.910
you are a son of the shadows.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.740
I also know the way of shade.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.920
This is a sad story.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.320
This is why you cause trouble here?

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.470
I don't need your pity.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.440
Changer form

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.440
Shape Shifter

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.490
I see... You're a Kuruta.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:37.070
When a <i>Shape Shifter</i> creates a body,

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:40.970
it thoroughly analyzes its target.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.200
What strength!

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.040
Strengthening type ?

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.840
You were not a manipulation type ?

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.760
I told you.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.050
You can not compare the strengths of <i>Nen</i> and <i>On</i>.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.040
There is no type for those who live in the world of <i>On</i>.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.330
Users of the <i>On</i> can exploit

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.540
potential of each type to its fullest.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.700
I see.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.650
This was it.

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.000
Holy Chain

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.200
What good wind.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:04.200
Here?

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.950
Hi.

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.450
Hisoka.

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.460
Let me go!

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.430
Are you sure?

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:28.800
No !

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.970
Do not let me!

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:33.300
I stayed here because it is noisy inside...

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.360
But you're still louder.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.680
What !?

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.780
What do you want ?

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.780
Three of a kind is stronger than a pair.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.260
And a square is stronger than a set.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.030
What do you mean?

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:51.970
When all the cards are gathered,

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:55.040
the game becomes much more funnier.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:58.810
Shall we?

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.670
Finish playing.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.080
<i>What a mess</i>

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.540
<i>I wanted to kill him in broad daylight and in front of a crowd of people watching,</i>

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:20.260
<i>not in a narrow and dark place like this place</i>

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.360
Kirua !

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.600
Hey, ho! Gon.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.130
Looks like you're in trouble.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.820
Even. 

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.470
How did you move it ?

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.980
This is a magnetic elevator.

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.280
It moves with magnets.

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:50.620
Really?

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.800
Gon!

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:55.130
Shit.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.720
<i> Wow </ i></i>

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.930
<i>He's still up here</i>

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.990
<i>It is tied for fist fight</i>

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.180
<i>But I'm faster than him</i>

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.070
Over!

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.130
Impossible.

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:47.910
Why I can't move?

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:51.610
Rock, paper...

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.120
When is he...

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:22.040
They have grown up...

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.780
We success.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:28.720
Yeah.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.120
For...

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.270
Why?

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.590
How?

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.860
How did you stop me?

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:38.460
This lift moves through

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.470
magnets that are fixed in the walls and form an axis

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:45.370
wherein magnets attached to the cage can move.

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:46.370
So,

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:49.870
I just had to remove the magnet that connected the elevator.

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.110
Welding is easy.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.740
Shit.

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.020
When did you do that?

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.110
This is because you stayed focused on Gon.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:05.090
A real battle going on in one against one.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.080
You participate in the <i>BattleOlympia</i> ?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.160
Huh?

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.510
No.

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.610
But one of our friends is involved.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.440
He's called Zushi.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.890
Whatever you slurried,

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:36.820
small bald karate.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.010
I see.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.200
He had a good punch.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.840
He's still inexperienced,

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.300
but if he trains, he will become stronger.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.370
Yeah,

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.380
your melee technique was not bad for an old man.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.220
Yes!

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.460
Instead of doing that,

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.960
You should have to participate in the <i>Battle Olympia</i>.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.440
You might have been able to go further.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.240
What up?

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:38.320
Stay away!

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.590
This is my oath to <i>On</i>.

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.610
But...

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.450
Gon!

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.410
When he loses

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.120
really explodes.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.290
What for?

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:23.780
What for?

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:25.860
Dis...

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.760
I can not understand.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.480
How can we swear it to his companions?

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.680
These are his companions!

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.820
What for?

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.140
I can not forgive.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.490
If we do that to become strong with <i> On </ i>, they are wrong!</i>

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.630
Gaki!

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.040
Fellow with whom I shared my blood.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.910
Your death will not be in vain.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.870
I will avenge you!

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:20.450
He disappeared.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:27.280
He is gone.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.050
Gaki.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:34.060
I am now alone.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.640
Why do you fight?

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.840
If you are a survivor of Kuruta,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.280
like me,

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.010
you must be angry and want revenge.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.840
At the bottom of your red eyes,

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.680
on your anger feels like to have lost your family

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.520
and your hatred towards those who you have taken.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.060
This is the same for us.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.290
I do not!

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.360
It would be a shame to kill you.

01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:19.140
SignUp.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.990
Be like us,

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:25.810
user <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:30.050
I refuse.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.870
I see.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.060
In this case,

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:39.480
die.

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:45.940
Kurapika!

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.040
Hey!

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.290
Pull yourself together!

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.670
What is this?

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.030
From <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.260
<i> On </ i>?</i>

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.730
He is obsessed with avenging his companions.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.230
Revenge?

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.540
Yes I do.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.550
Just like me.

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:22.690
Do not talk crap!

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.780
This is nonsense.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.050
You're not at all like him.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.010
Listening.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.350
If you allow yourself one day carried away by hatred,

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.420
Gon, Killua, or I

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.020
we will you a good punch in the mouth

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.020
to wake you up!

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:44.830
Do you hear me?

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.240
Pull yourself together!

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.210
If you are already left you away,

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:52.430
I'll wake you right now...

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.600
I am not yet fallen so low

01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:58.970
to let you hit me.

01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.980
What?

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.340
I found new companions.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:07.980
Now

01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:10.740
I will fight for them.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.520
Ah?

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.040
Now we can play a little more.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.760
This is not good.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.970
This is what your <i> On </ i> can do?</i>

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.970
<i> It hurts </ i>!</i>

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.220
Even  <i> protecting me <i> Ten </ i>, I take as much damage </ i></i>

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.520
<i> He has tremendous strength </ i></i>

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.020
He was less than expected.

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.730
Jed...

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.300
Sama...

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.920
What is this thing?

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:02.930
It does not look very good for the body.

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:09.090
You can not use Nen <i> </ i>.</i>

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:10.430
What?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.710
What hast thou done?

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.890
Take it as an honor.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.320
This is the blood of Jed-sama.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.010
With this blood,

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:23.080
you can awaken you to the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.450
It's okay?

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:34.420
You can live only for your revenge on the strength of <i> On </ i></i>

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.580
and to fight only to accomplish.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.250
I refuse.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:41.860
Kurapika.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.860
I'm fighting for...

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.840
Do as you wish.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:52.830
However,

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:55.680
If you are not ready oath <i> On </ i></i>

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.650
there is only death awaits you.

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.210
Jed-sama...

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:07.920
I proved my loyalty to you.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.920
Then

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:15.120
get a complete vengeance with your own hands...

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.460
Kurapika.

01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:22.900
Hold on!

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.320
Kurapika!

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.780
It lacks excitement, everything...

01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:29.410
It was worth about 65 points.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.720
Shura.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.040
Your death

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.870
thy wrath

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:56.430
will become my strength.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.740
I will have our revenge!

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.580
By giving them your blood

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.610
hast taken in thy <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:13.170
Yes I do.

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:15.010
Upon receiving my blood

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.720
and swearing,

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.300
they got strength <i> On </ i> that exceeds <i> Nen </ i>.</i>

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.740
So why do not you use your blood on me?

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:31.710
For this force,

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:34.520
I had sworn.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.730
Netero.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.820
There are only about you that my blood has no effect.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:44.330
Place the one I hate the most

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.490
outside my ability

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.260
is evidence that in addition to wanting to fight,

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.060
I am ready to die to accomplish my goal.

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:58.040
The influence <i> On </ i> makes you mad.</i>

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.120
Think what you want.

01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:02.690
But I want you to stay conscious,

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:04.880
until the end.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:08.080
See with your own eyes the fall

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.120
and the destruction of the Hunter organization you have created.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.530
Kurapika!

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.500
Yo!

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:24.430
Hisoka.

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:25.500
What about me?

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.410
Kurapika!

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:27.780
What happened?

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.160
Apparently he received the blood of a Jed.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.500
I have not yet fully understood, but it looks like he can no longer use <i> Nen </ i>.</i>

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.420
And he will die if he does not enter into a contract with the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.560
How?

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:45.160
Do not worry.

01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:51.020
I do not spend a contract with the <i> On </ i>, even if I have to die.</i>

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.200
Kurapika! You must not die!

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:54.480
So

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.190
he must enter into a contract with the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:57.460
He can not do that either.

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.840
Kurapika, hold on!

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.020
Do not worry for me.

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:09.500
Sauve others.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.400
I will save everyone.

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:15.230
And I'll save you too!

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:17.620
Because we're friends!

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:23.510
Then he'll have to beat this guy, Jed...

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.540
All cards are there.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:32.110
You'll have to give everything you have to beat the last enemy. 

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.440
If you want to win the game,

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.800
must choose when you will use your joker.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.480
What do you mean?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.930
The enemy can be as loud as he wants,

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.350
I will use all means

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:54.220
to beat Jed!

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.210
Wait here, Kurapika.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.320
I'll save at all costs.

01:12:58.690 --> 01:13:00.510
Leolio, take care of Kurapika.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.300
Yeah!

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:02.830
Killua.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.220
Yes I do.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:08.970
Shall we.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.880
I trust you more,

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.470
Gon.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.490
<i> Kurapika's heart beats almost... </ i></i>

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:25.880
<i> But... </ i></i>

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:29.520
<i> I can not leave alone Neon &lt; / i&gt;</i>

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.120
Come, come!

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.520
Viewing.

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:59.130
It seems that no spectator was injured.

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:02.960
So I thought I could rest for once

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.750
it made me tired.

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:08.190
The attack is not yet finished. 

01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:12.680
They will take care of the rest.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.820
No doubt.

01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:19.910
Well, we must evacuate the audience.

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.460
Hee...

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.080
Zushi!

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.330
Shall we.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:25.710
Osu!

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.660
What power.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.780
In fact, this place is dangerous.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.650
I will destroy you!

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.280
Life My friend is at stake

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.320
Ah?

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.530
A friend?

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.020
This is a shame.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.020
Your friend is hunter, right?

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.460
All users <i> Nen </ i></i>

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.850
will disappear from this world to the last.

01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:17.020
The <i> On </ i> will lead everything.</i>

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.530
I will not let you do it!

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.860
More energy?

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.200
I'll go first!

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.310
Pierre

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.540
Paper

01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.020
Killua!

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.090
It's okay!

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.910
Pierre

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.620
Stop using your power!

01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:56.920
Gon!

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:03.900
Can not even touch.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.140
We can not win with emission techniques.

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.720
But if you touch his blood, that's it!

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.710
Stone... First

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:12.500
I told you to stop!

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.720
Pierre, paper...

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:14.890
Scissors!

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:25.620
<i> It is very </ i></i>

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.730
<i> How to win against him </ i></i>

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:29.230
Gon!

01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:35.540
If we do not kill, it is Kurapika will die.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.090
Not necessarily,

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.550
sufficient that a contract with the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.600
I will not let that happen!

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:44.880
So

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:47.920
I have a contract with the <i> On </ i> and beat you!</i>

01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.900
What?

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.790
Ah?

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.630
Do not say bullshit.

01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:56.190
Jed, I'm your enemy, I will give everything!

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.980
Killua, okay?

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.780
Gon.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.010
It was a good attack.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.850
Idiot! What for?

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.380
Good. You have nothing.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.510
Killua!

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.210
Peter

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.480
Ah!

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.980
I can not use Nen <i> </ i>.</i>

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:49.840
Hehe...

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.970
At this rate...

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:02.430
Killua,

01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:03.960
Kurapika,

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.790
even Netero...

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:15.340
<i> He is strong, incredibly strong </ i. ></i>

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:16.840
<i> But, </ i></i>

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.880
<i> I must beat </ i></i>

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:26.890
<i> He hurt my friends </ i></i>

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.910
I need to

01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:31.820
beat it!

01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:38.010
If it is like that,

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.150
What?

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.980
I have to use the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:48.570
I sworn,

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:50.740
And I pass the contract.

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:56.410
Do not do that, Gon.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.180
Stop!

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.880
I have to protect my friends!

01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:08.430
Okay! Tastes the same pattern as me.

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.330
This is how?

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.720
This power that pervades your whole body.

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:16.750
You changed your anger into strength.

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.770
That's <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.620
<i> It is hard, but thanks to the <i> On </ i> </ i></i>

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:32.460
<i> If this continues, will Gon... </ i></i>

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.410
You're one of us now.

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:40.030
I'll never be with you!

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.230
Pierre, paper...

01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:46.490
Pierre!

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.980
If you do not join us, I'll just eat you,

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.910
everything  become the source of my strength.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.980
<i> Even with the One he could not win </ i></i>

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.950
<i> I can not do anything </ i></i>

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:06.960
Huh?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.900
Killua ,

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.980
There are more than you can use <i> Nen </ i>.</i>

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.000
Papy...

01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:29.010
If this continues, you will die.

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:32.280
Come on, takes the oath of last <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:35.410
Your anger and your hate become your strength.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.850
You want me to kill your friend?

01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:42.360
Either way, the hunters who will not join me

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.690
will all die.

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.090
Do you really want to die here?

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:53.700
Gon and Killua do their best.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.410
If you're their friend, do not die!

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.720
Killua.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.080
I fought with your companions.

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:29.940
Even without the force <i> On </ i></i>

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:33.390
it was quite strong enough.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.460
I do not want my companions

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.550
become stronger through the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:46.040
Put ​​an end to all that.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.630
Well,

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.410
Aaaaargh...

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.680
Aaaaargh...

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.630
Hundred arms Buddha

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.630
Hyakushiki Kannon

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.740
Hmm...

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.100
Aah!

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.640
Gon.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.270
What did you do?

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:56.500
<i> Hyakushiki Kannon </ i> is the force diametrically opposed to the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:00.530
The winner is simply the strongest.

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:08.040
Open your eyes, Gon!

01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:20.210
Gon's fate is in his own hands.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.450
Let's settle our accounts!

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:33.530
It's been a long time since I did not fight with you.

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:37.200
Hyakkijuon

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:38.560
Rasetsu 

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.760
I'll never let go of the side of the shade.

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.760
If you wanted power in the <i> On </ i></i>

01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:14.330
is to avenge the weak.

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:16.580
This is what you said, is not it?

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.910
Absolutely!

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.920
But I realized something watching you.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.080
You gather just the sorrows of others.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.750
You are like me.

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.410
You'll always be a hunter!

01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:33.750
I do not!

01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:37.260
This is probably me

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.430
who put you on the road.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:43.370
We are like two sides of a coin.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.110
We're no different.

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:47.830
Our roads are just separated.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.240
Although this is true, our roads will cross again.

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:55.810
At this point,

01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:57.940
I should stop.

01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:00.940
You were my friend.

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.960
This is my sin of not being able to save you.

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:09.290
Continue to attack me until you liberate yourself

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.630
Sorrows, anger and hatred

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.850
whom thou hast borne, and are dead.

01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:18.470
Nonsense!

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:26.640
Return, Gon!

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:29.260
Do not forget we're friends!

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.640
What?

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.290
What...

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:52.060
Gon.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.290
I'm back, Killua.

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:05.680
Jed, it's me who'll take care of you.

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:07.450
What?

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:10.310
I'll...

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:14.120
I'll...

01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:24.640
Motherfucker! Mischief!

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:26.970
Hyakkijuon

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:28.080
Rasetsu 

01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:30.670
Rock... Paper...

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:34.410
Rock!

01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:52.230
I can not understand.

01:26:52.230 --> 01:26:54.220
Revenge for which

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.730
you're ready to kill your friends.

01:26:57.370 --> 01:27:00.240
But even if I can not express it well,

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:02.760
The fact that you can not do anything alone,

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.970
resentment, sadness,

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.910
I can not accept what you did,

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.480
and I still do not understand everything,

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.220
but I understand your pain.

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.490
I never let it happen again.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.860
From now on we will manage,

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.590
so do not worry about the future.

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:25.930
Rest in peace.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.100
Impossible.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:32.770
The only thing that can win against the <i> On </ i></i>

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.100
is a pure and compassionate heart can forgive everything.

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:41.670
We were caught in the past,

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.610
but these kids have the power to shape the future.

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:51.620
I lost? Against this kid?

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.790
But Netero...

01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:56.800
I do not regret

01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.290
it will be finished as well.

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.640
Our Fight

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:05.300
is not yet finished.

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:10.970
The next time I'll...

01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:40.830
Today, we'll say it was a draw.

01:28:42.210 --> 01:28:45.600
But one day we will end this fight.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.580
Yeah.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.330
Until then,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.450
Face?

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:13.000
I will argue in the shadow organization of hunters.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.770
Take care of the other side.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.210
This suit you, really?

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:33.090
Yes, for now.

01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:37.230
But one day...

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:04.250
At Nirvana, without losing or winning,

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:06.160
doing good trip

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.180
and rest in peace.

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:15.310
Hey!

01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:18.060
Kurapika!

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.100
I'm glad you're safe !

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.610
This is a thanks to you, thank you.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.210
This is normal, we're friends.

01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:32.850
You will remember me a little?

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:36.420
Ah? And what did you do this time Leolio?

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:39.290
Well...

01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.420
I heard you.

01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:47.170
Your encouragement when I was poisoned by the <i>On</i>.

01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:48.180
Ah?

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.440
These were sentences with rose water.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.470
Well, actually...

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.140
More importantly,

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.300
how did you beat Jed?

01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.970
Well?

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.480
You have a contract with the <i> On </ i>?</i>

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.810
What?

01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:07.520
But Killua brought me to reason.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.980
Thank you, Killua.

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.480
You really are crazy!

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.820
You exaggerate,

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.930
even if it is for your friends.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.420
I thought I would die!

01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:30.930
The oath will remain Gon?

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.470
Jed's death is the death of the <i> On </ i>.</i>

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.850
His heart was purified.

01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:39.070
There is more concern.

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:42.190
The darkness disappeared.

01:31:57.670 --> 01:31:58.970
Dawn arrives.

01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:00.560
Yes I do.

01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:10.630


01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.040
朝をむさぼり　夜を吐き出し

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.040
 Asa wo wo hakidashi musabori york

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.040
 Devouring morning and spitting my nights

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.220
生かんとする　我が性(さが)

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.220
 Ikan to suru waga saga

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.220
 I doubt nature

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.820
沸き立つ　この感情は

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.820
 Wakitatsu wa kono kanjo

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.820
 This will end in my heart

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.980
白か　黒か

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.980
 Shiro kuro ka ka

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.980
 Is it black or white?

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.950
To all fans of the world

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.080
No...

01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:29.900
