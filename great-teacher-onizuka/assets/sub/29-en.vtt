CAMPING SCHOOL INFORMATION

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:44.683
Are you going on the school trip?

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.830
If you're going,
we're thinking of going too...

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.956
Why do you ask me
every little thing?!

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.795
Do whatever you like!

00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:52.868
Miyabi!

00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:55.466
She's not in a good mood.

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:56.900
It's no surprise...

00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:59.940
...because even her last chance,
Urumi, didn't work.

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:03.178
Wow! Move! Move away!

00:02:04.314 --> 00:02:06.282
Hey, hey!
Unless you speed up a little more...

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:07.907
...we won't have
enough room to make it!

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:11.053
Are you sure you're going
to give me the money...

00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:12.553
...if I reach 60km/h?!

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.418
You've been luring me with stuff...

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:16.515
...and making me pick you up
every morning...!

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:18.150
Hey, it's almost 60km/h!

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:21.055
Really?! Wowwwww!

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:27.797
Move, move!

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:29.996
Is he going to run us over?!
They'd better be more serious!

00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:35.410
Urumi, Onizuka!

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:36.567
I'm coming!

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.271
Comaneci in the air!

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:43.349
Your reference is out of date!

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:44.420
Uncool.

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.488
Shut up!

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.982
They're so stupid!

00:02:48.658 --> 00:02:50.888
You guys are so easy.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:56.728
I can teach you a real dive!

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:57.959
Stop!

00:02:58.068 --> 00:02:59.592
It isn't a good idea
to jump from there!

00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:00.963
Here I come!

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:03.966
Moonsault Dive!

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.882
Is he okay?

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:17.410
Doesn't look good...

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.144
Is he dead?

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:29.565
Felt good!

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:31.065
All right. One more time!

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.361
You're bleeding from your nose!

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.561
- Don't do it anymore.
- You'll die!

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:35.871
Let's do it. You too!

00:03:35.972 --> 00:03:36.996
- Stop!
- Leave us alone!

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:39.432
Let's go!

00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:41.968
You've changed, Kanzaki.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.741
You used to force
yourself to smile...

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.908
...and you usually had
a blank expression on your face.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.754
Onizuka is a really mysterious guy.

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:55.884
He's stupid, simple-minded,
lewd and a punk...

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.817
It's hard to believe
he's a teacher...

00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:01.223
Yeah...

00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:04.399
I, who hated
the school that much...

00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:07.027
...can't help coming here
every day now.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.898
It's really strange.

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:10.836
I wonder if I owe him for that...

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.373
This is the first time
I've ever thought school is fun.

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:22.749
I hope this lasts long...

00:04:24.954 --> 00:04:27.445
Of course it will,
as long as he's here.

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:33.728
You! Get serious!
We almost died!

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:35.862
LADIES' ROOM

00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:41.396
You've got
many friends now, Urumi-chan.

00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:44.940
It's good for you
to enjoy school.

00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:46.705
It's hard to believe...

00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:48.572
...you didn't come
to school for a long time.

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:51.175
If you envy me that much...

00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.647
...I don't mind
including you in our group.

00:04:55.618 --> 00:04:59.486
How can you enjoy yourself
with a teacher?!

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:00.987
You traitor!

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:02.614
Did you forget about our friend?!

00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:07.085
We had one more person
in Class 2-4!

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.590
Did you forget about that?!

00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.190
Sorry.

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.467
I didn't come to school
at that time...

00:05:15.572 --> 00:05:17.563
...and I don't know the details.

00:05:17.774 --> 00:05:18.968
What did you say?!

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:20.834
That's enough.

00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:24.505
If you want to get Onizuka
fired that much, do it by yourself.

00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:27.916
Or can't you do anything alone?

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:31.211
I guess you can't,
because you're a princess.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.654
Shit!

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.318
That woman makes me sick!

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.562
She called me a princess!
Don't mess with me!

00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:48.465
Now I'll get Onizuka fired
no matter what method we use.

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:50.797
Crap! I'll get him fired!

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.964
Definitely!

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:55.376
But how are we going to do it?

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:58.605
Our last chance was Urumi,
and she's on Onizuka's side.

00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:01.613
Even if we want to get
our homeroom teacher fired...

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:04.952
I don't think we can do
anything serious enough...

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:06.851
...to get Onizuka fired
by ourselves...

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:11.590
I have an idea.

00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:14.696
I've got
some interesting information.

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:18.023
Wow! It's WCCS Frogman!

00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:20.627
I've always wanted that.

00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:22.430
How did you get it, Kusano?!

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:25.338
Well, when I went
into a shop in Kichijoji...

00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:26.772
...they had only ten in stock.

00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:29.572
I couldn't help buying one,
even though it cost me 50,000 yen.

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:31.338
50,000 yen?!

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:33.448
You were definitely cheated!

00:06:33.883 --> 00:06:35.282
Don't you know it?!

00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.182
When it lights up,
a manta ray shows up.

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:39.152
It's a limited edition
and extremely rare!

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:41.150
They'll be sold out soon.

00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:42.747
Why don't you buy one now?

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:46.189
How can I buy one?!

00:06:46.663 --> 00:06:48.790
Please let me have it just today!

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.431
Oh, stop it.
You're going to scratch it.

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:51.761
- Let me have it!
- Don't touch it!

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:54.698
- Don't touch it!
- Fujiyoshi!

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:57.836
Sakurada wants you
to come to the faculty room.

00:06:58.508 --> 00:06:59.634
Sakurada said?

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:02.311
Collecting money?! Me?!

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:03.839
That's right!

00:07:04.147 --> 00:07:07.776
I want you to collect
everyone's money for the school trip.

00:07:08.418 --> 00:07:11.717
But isn't that a job
for our class representatives?

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:14.820
Think about it!

00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:18.993
Class 3-4 has a lot of problems
including their unbelievable teacher.

00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:22.297
You are the only one I can trust.

00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:23.499
Understand?

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:24.566
But...

00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.128
I'm counting on you. All right?

00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:33.398
Why do I have to do this...?

00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:40.248
28,000 yen per person
times 40 people...

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.847
1, 120,000 yen!
1, 120,000 yen! Wow!

00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:50.119
Let's escape to a foreign country
with this money, just us!

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:51.193
Idiot!

00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:53.192
If we do that...

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.628
...the others can't go
on the school trip.

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:57.255
If we invest
that money in junk bonds...

00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:58.732
...and leave them for ten years...

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:00.699
...then it would turn quite a prof it.

00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:03.203
Rather than that,
why don't we make pamphlets...

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:05.365
...saying "Japanese cattle
owners needed" and trick them?

00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:07.304
What are you thinking of?!

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.001
I'll bet 1, 120,000 yen
on No. 2 to show.

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:11.943
Combination with 3, 4, 6 and 8.

00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:13.743
Yeah, I got cash.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.615
It isn't your money!

00:08:16.085 --> 00:08:21.148
As Sakurada said,
they are terrible.

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.591
But if I had this money...

00:08:24.694 --> 00:08:26.924
...I could have bought
the Frogman with no problems...

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.730
What am I thinking...?!

00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:33.096
Excuse me.

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:35.927
Where is Sakurada-sensei?

00:08:36.406 --> 00:08:38.601
He already went home.

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:39.675
What?

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.708
They'll be sold out soon.

00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.508
Why don't you buy one now?

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:54.155
I guess I can just look at it...

00:09:00.963 --> 00:09:02.794
Thank you very much!

00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:07.165
I did it. I bought it!

00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:11.299
Unbelievable!

00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:15.107
It's genuine!
Real Frogman WCCS!

00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:16.735
Wow, cool!

00:09:19.382 --> 00:09:22.374
I guess I have to ask Mom...

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:25.153
...for an advance on my allowance
and return the money.

00:09:25.254 --> 00:09:26.687
Then it won't be stealing...

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.456
Wow, I'm glad I bought it!

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.527
Oh!

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:34.229
The manta ray is shining! Wow!

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.698
Hello. Yes, It's me.

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:41.626
Are you going home now?

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:43.466
I still have a lot of energy.

00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:45.541
You haven't done it for a long time.

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:47.074
He's frustrated...

00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:48.336
Oh, shut up, kids!

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:51.339
By the way, where is Fujiyoshi?

00:09:51.914 --> 00:09:53.245
We did it! Perfect!

00:09:53.783 --> 00:09:54.875
I don't know.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:58.647
I haven't seen him since he left
with the money for the faculty room.

00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:01.082
Did he split with the money?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.758
No way.
He doesn't have the guts to do it.

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:05.455
That's true.

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:08.627
Okay, I'll be waiting for you then.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.767
- Bye, Teacher!
- See you!

00:10:11.868 --> 00:10:12.835
Yeah!

00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:17.830
- Return to me!
- No.

00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:20.768
Hey, don't run in the room.

00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:22.401
He took my Dean!

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:23.945
You lost in the game!

00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:25.513
Miyako, where is Mom?

00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:26.741
Working.

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:33.450
I'm home now.

00:10:33.556 --> 00:10:34.955
Welcome back, Koji.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:39.719
I have a favor to ask.

00:10:40.096 --> 00:10:41.791
Yes? Allowance?

00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:44.656
How did you know?

00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:55.140
Please!
Please advance me 50,000 yen!

00:10:55.444 --> 00:10:57.241
I'll collect my New Year's
cash present from relatives...

00:10:57.346 --> 00:10:58.404
...and pay you back.

00:10:58.781 --> 00:11:00.476
Please!

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:02.647
We can't afford that much.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:05.479
We just paid the fee
for your school trip.

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:10.083
I'm sure
you know our money situation.

00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:20.793
As I thought, it's hopeless...

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.799
This isn't good...

00:11:23.005 --> 00:11:24.165
I have to do something.

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:25.240
Otherwise...

00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:27.172
... I'll have to return
the Frogman to the store...

00:11:31.314 --> 00:11:33.305
Oh, no,
I can't find the collection bag!

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:36.641
I'm sure it was here
when I bought the G-Shock...

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:37.853
Did I....?

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:38.921
No way...!

00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:40.918
Did I lose it?!

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.623
SHUKIN BUKURO
(COLLECTION BAG)

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.915
What's going on, Sakurada-sensei?

00:11:48.827 --> 00:11:51.853
The third-year students' grades
are really low...

00:11:51.963 --> 00:11:53.396
...compared to the other years.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.037
That's because...

00:11:56.212 --> 00:11:57.941
If it continues like this...

00:11:58.414 --> 00:12:01.679
...it hurts the reputation
of our prestigious...

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:04.912
...Holy Forest Academy
and the PTA will start to complain.

00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:07.985
I'm telling you, Vice Principal,
there is a reason...

00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:11.691
No excuse is necessary.
This trash! Useless man!

00:12:12.128 --> 00:12:15.825
I did you a favor making you
the head teacher of the third year...

00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:18.332
...and this is how you repay me?

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:21.827
If this lasts,
you need to resign...

00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:23.735
...as the head teacher
of the third year...

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.502
Or you may need to leave the school
and take full responsibility.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.273
Be prepared.

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:33.171
No! Please don't do that!

00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:35.982
Oh, it makes me sick!
It makes me sick!

00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:38.848
God damn it!
Damn it! Damn!

00:12:39.222 --> 00:12:41.349
What's the matter, teacher?

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:45.316
Your work seems really hard.

00:12:45.728 --> 00:12:48.891
In order to lessen your stress,
you did this...

00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:50.496
Wow! What a big lump!

00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:55.768
As you said, I asked Fujiyoshi
to collect the money.

00:12:56.406 --> 00:12:59.170
So you've kept it secret,
haven't you?

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.137
I have another favor to ask...

00:13:02.245 --> 00:13:03.234
What?!

00:13:03.346 --> 00:13:04.836
Don't get carried away...

00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:07.142
...just because I listened to you
the first time...

00:13:07.283 --> 00:13:10.116
You're a damned girl!

00:13:10.219 --> 00:13:11.914
I won't listen to you anymore!

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.579
Okay, then.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.591
You won't mind if I distribute
this photo all over the school.

00:13:19.796 --> 00:13:20.785
You?!

00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:24.161
Is this what's called cross-dressing?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.131
You have a nice hobby,
Sakurada-sensei.

00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:29.534
Oh, my God!

00:13:30.773 --> 00:13:33.936
This, this was the time
I thought I needed to have...

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:36.978
...some different
experiences as a teacher...

00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:41.641
If other people find out,
I wonder what will happen.

00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.385
The PTA will accuse you...

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.717
...you may get demoted,
or even fired...

00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:48.484
That won't be enough.

00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:51.492
If his children find out
their father is like that...

00:13:51.594 --> 00:13:53.653
...they'll be ashamed
and his wife would leave him, too.

00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:56.288
She'll divorce him,
and the family will be destroyed...

00:13:56.933 --> 00:14:00.391
No! Please don't do that!

00:14:00.503 --> 00:14:01.731
I beg of you!

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.440
Then you'll help us,
won't you, Sakurada-sensei...

00:14:06.576 --> 00:14:09.170
...the head teacher
of the third year?

00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:13.312
Idiot!

00:14:15.418 --> 00:14:17.079
Shoot!

00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:20.779
Remember!
When I bought it, it was in my bag!

00:14:21.724 --> 00:14:22.986
That's right!

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:29.155
Wow... I'm bored.

00:14:29.298 --> 00:14:31.266
The only way I can kill time
is to watch porn videos...

00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:32.334
Onizuka-sensei!

00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:35.232
Boy, I was looking
for you everywhere.

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:38.100
Sakurada-sensei. You're still here?

00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:39.866
As a matter of fact...

00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:43.739
I want to take you
to a special place...

00:14:44.413 --> 00:14:47.143
What?!
A secret school uniform bar?!

00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.714
I've heard that young
and energetic girls...

00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:51.753
... provide a good time...

00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:56.655
As part of social study for a teacher,
I thought we should check it out...

00:14:56.793 --> 00:15:00.923
Sure! We have to go!
It's a social study!

00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:04.891
I'm going! Definitely going!

00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:07.936
Please wait a minute.
I'm getting my jacket!

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.006
Oh, cologne. Cologne.

00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:16.644
I'm ready!

00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:20.140
Energetic gals' great time...!

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:23.275
Then I may be...

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.381
Wow! I can't wait!

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:38.295
Welcome!

00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.999
- Lost and found?!
- What?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.635
Why is this in my jacket?

00:15:48.044 --> 00:15:50.877
Well, Onizuka-sensei,
we have to go soon... Wow!

00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:54.009
What?
What's this 1, 120,000 yen?!

00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:55.875
Is this 1, 120,000 yen?

00:15:55.985 --> 00:15:59.045
How do you know
the exact amount?

00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:05.126
Oh, no, but we have to go now,
or we'll be late for our reservation...

00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:08.297
Yeah, yes, that's true, but...

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:12.835
Oh, well.

00:16:12.935 --> 00:16:14.732
It isn't a problem to have it anyway.

00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.469
Let's go, Sakurada-sensei.

00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:23.143
We don't have it.
No one left any cash here.

00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:28.012
You should have it!
It's in a shabby paper envelope!

00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:30.244
I can't think of any
other place but here!

00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:33.851
No matter how many times
you look for it, nothing is here.

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:39.318
Sometimes
we see people look for problems...

00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:43.192
Don't screw around with me!
Oh, shit!

00:16:46.502 --> 00:16:47.560
Here we are.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.867
Wow, they really get into it.
I'm even blindfolded...

00:16:51.974 --> 00:16:55.501
Because this is a secret bar
with real high school gals.

00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.374
It's pretty severe...

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:02.283
Here we are.

00:17:02.385 --> 00:17:04.046
Wait a minute!

00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:05.848
Okay now!

00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:10.616
Welcome!

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.389
Welcome to the secret infirmary
of Pink School!

00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:17.864
How about it, Onizuka-sensei?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.399
Secret infirmary?

00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:21.902
This is exactly the same
as the real one.

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:25.970
Here we go, Teacher.
Please. Teacher...

00:17:27.076 --> 00:17:29.874
I've heard that you're a teacher.

00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:31.913
Today please enjoy all the things...

00:17:32.014 --> 00:17:34.642
...you can't do with your students.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.877
What is the size of this glass?!

00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:38.613
- Please.
- What?

00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:42.551
Drink in one gulp!
Go, go, go, go!

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:45.125
Go, go, go, go!

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.622
Here.
Please enjoy yourself, Onizuka-sensei!

00:17:50.733 --> 00:17:53.031
A teacher needs some
excitement once in a while.

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:56.770
I'm so grateful
that you took me here...

00:17:56.872 --> 00:17:57.930
...Sakurada-sensei.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.270
It's heaven. Heaven!

00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:03.368
I thought you were a serious guy,
but you like this stuff...!

00:18:05.448 --> 00:18:07.006
Okay, everyone!

00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:09.242
Go, go, go, go!

00:18:09.352 --> 00:18:10.944
- Go, go, go, go!
- All right!

00:18:13.589 --> 00:18:15.853
There are
different kinds of lost items...

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:19.757
It's cash.
About 1. 1 million yen.

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:23.231
What? Are you joking?!

00:18:23.632 --> 00:18:25.691
It's not a joke. I'm serious.

00:18:25.868 --> 00:18:27.529
What are you talking about?

00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:30.698
Are you saying
that much money is yours?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.007
No.

00:18:32.274 --> 00:18:34.401
Then whose is it?
Explain that to me.

00:18:34.677 --> 00:18:36.076
It's for school...

00:18:36.212 --> 00:18:38.612
School?
Which school do you belong to?

00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:40.040
... Holy Forest...

00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:42.174
What? I can't hear you.

00:18:42.752 --> 00:18:43.844
What's up?

00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:47.386
This kid is asking if 1. 1 million yen
is in Lost and Found.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.718
1.1 million yen?

00:18:49.392 --> 00:18:51.189
How did you get that much money?

00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:53.318
Why were you carrying it?

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.363
You! Answer me!

00:18:57.767 --> 00:19:00.463
You didn't steal it, did you?

00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:04.163
How could I steal it?
Don't make a fool of me!

00:19:04.974 --> 00:19:06.965
Shit police!

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:10.168
Hey, wait! Hey!

00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:12.973
Crap!

00:19:13.783 --> 00:19:15.546
Out! Safe!

00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:17.118
Here comes a result!

00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:21.086
Shit!

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.091
This time, I'm going to beat you!

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.858
All right. Here we go.

00:19:27.563 --> 00:19:29.554
When you play baseball...

00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:30.757
This is what you wanted,
right, Aizawa?

00:19:30.866 --> 00:19:32.663
-... let's do this way.
- Thank you, Sakurada-sensei.

00:19:32.835 --> 00:19:35.827
Your performance was pretty good.

00:19:35.938 --> 00:19:39.430
- Out! Safe! Here comes the result!
- Please stop here, I beg of you.

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:44.209
Deceiving someone really
bothers my conscience.

00:19:44.313 --> 00:19:46.941
Are you all right
if everyone knows your secret?

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.615
Are you still going to use me?

00:19:52.154 --> 00:19:55.920
Miyabi! He's pretty wasted.

00:19:56.525 --> 00:20:00.552
Don't worry. Make him drink
until he can't remember anything.

00:20:00.663 --> 00:20:02.824
I'll give everyone a good tip!

00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:03.899
Okay!

00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:07.169
Look at him. Idiot.

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:09.601
He's enjoying himself
without a doubt.

00:20:09.705 --> 00:20:12.970
Out, safe, here comes the result!

00:20:17.012 --> 00:20:19.378
Oh, shit! Where is it?

00:20:19.582 --> 00:20:22.210
Yeah, limbo! Limbo!

00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:25.782
How could I lose
that much money...?

00:20:26.622 --> 00:20:28.317
What should I do...?

00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:31.423
How could I tell my classmates...?

00:20:31.694 --> 00:20:33.924
Help, please help...

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.888
Onizuka-sensei...!

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:41.225
It'll be a lot of fun tomorrow.

00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:46.241
All right! Next is
the Moustache Dance! Oops.

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:50.274
Wow, strange...

00:20:51.313 --> 00:20:53.213
It's spinning...

00:21:05.294 --> 00:21:06.818
Hey, isn't he dead?

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:08.123
No way...

00:21:12.668 --> 00:21:13.726
Stinky!

00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.235
Drunk guy?

00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:16.531
Bad habit, really.

00:21:23.312 --> 00:21:24.301
What's this...?

00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:31.412
Why am I here?

00:21:48.068 --> 00:21:52.835
Subete no hito wo aiseru wake ja

I beg of you! Please!

00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:25.462
Onizuka! Hey, Onizuka!

00:23:26.467 --> 00:23:27.434
So study by yourselves!

00:23:28.102 --> 00:23:29.592
It seems I was the one...

00:23:29.703 --> 00:23:31.534
