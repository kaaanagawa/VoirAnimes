00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:47.440

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.669
Nomura...

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:50.775
... is absent.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.478
Here!

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.752
I'm sorry.

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:03.524
I was reading a script last night,
and I couldn't get up this morning.

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:04.688
Toroko!

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.427
Didn't you tell me you couldn't
come today because of filming?

00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.209
Noooooooo!

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.417
Wow, that's Mayu Hazuki.

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:30.249
When I was the president of
the Idol Fan Club at Meiji University...

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.589
...she was traveling
to the hot springs...

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.162
... as a member
of this sexy group.

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.165
I'm so glad that she has become
such a big star now.

00:02:40.502 --> 00:02:42.834
I'm going to get her autograph.

00:02:43.138 --> 00:02:46.904
Oh, no. I'm in the industry now.
I can't do that.

00:02:47.943 --> 00:02:51.242
But I may be the only one
who has all three autographs...

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:55.305
... she used when she was
a member of the group...

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.079
Pink Elephant,
your girl hasn't come yet?

00:02:59.021 --> 00:03:02.218
I'm sorry. She's coming soon!

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:04.519
We're going to start
rehearsal in 10 minutes.

00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:05.660
Yes, sir.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:11.632
What?! Your girl?!
Her name is Tomoko Nomura!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.395
That's why I didn't want to take
an unscheduled role.

00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:19.236
Plan to make Tomoko Nomura
a superstar...

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:22.967
In order to make Tomoko
a star of the 21st century...

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.706
I didn't sleep for three days
concocting this plan.

00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:31.013
Soon she'll be a siren
of the silver screen!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.954
Of course, it will be a big hit!

00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:36.251
She'll be a star!

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.857
She'll appear on popular talk shows
like "Waratte litomo... "

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:43.830
... and "Tetsuko no Heya. "
She'll be set as a star!

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.864
And, and...!

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:46.599

How do you feel having the No.
1 star in Japan as your bride?

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:52.739
I'm happy!

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:57.338
I'd better call her again.

00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:05.847
She's still not answering.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.388
Just in case, check her school...

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.020
What's this?!

00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:13.385
Hellooo!

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:14.587
Hellooo!

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:18.856
Why do I have
Tomoko's cell phone?!

00:04:19.434 --> 00:04:20.492
That's right...!

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.172
During the photo session yesterday
I was holding it for her!

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.705
That's why I didn't want
to take an unscheduled role.

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:32.645
How can I contact Tomoko?

00:04:32.848 --> 00:04:34.645
Tomokoooo!

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.308
Hurry up, Toroko!

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.387
Yes!

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.812
Well...

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:44.991
Thank you very much!

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.489
Tomoko!

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:50.728
Tomoko!

00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:58.464
Okay, everyone! Stand by!

00:04:58.573 --> 00:04:59.972
We're doing a run-through.

00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:01.871
Lights!

00:05:02.678 --> 00:05:04.839
What do you mean
there's no scene for her?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.646
I apologize that she's late.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.979
Well, I feel sorry for you,
but the writer, Ashida-san, said...

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.712
...she wanted to change
the scene suddenly.

00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:16.848
Ashida-san said?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.092
Off the record, she doesn't like
girls with big breasts.

00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:24.565
What?!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.834
Anyway, that's all for today.

00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:29.403
We'll give you
another chance next time.

00:05:29.504 --> 00:05:31.904
Okay! Let's run through it!

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.571
Wait, Kojima-san!

00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:35.370
Four, three...

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.242
We're leaving, Tomoko.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.339
What?

00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:45.313
Oh, it makes me so mad!
A scenario writer?!

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.980
She's just a selfish old woman!
Don't play with us!

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.490
We did them a favor taking it...

00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:52.583
... because Tomoko's air time
would be more than a minute!

00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:55.492
Okay, then, I'm going to eat
all their staff's lunches!

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:59.226
As our revenge
I'm going to eat at their expense.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:02.702
Hello!

00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:05.136
Were you in time for work?

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:09.468
Onizuka-san!
What are you doing here?!

00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.906
I was just hungry.

00:06:12.114 --> 00:06:14.139
Amazing lunch for a TV station!

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.443
It's so good!

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.040
I'm going to have another one.

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:19.086
Why is everyone here?

00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:21.748
Onizuka asked us to come here.

00:06:21.857 --> 00:06:24.325
We're taking a field trip
to your workplace.

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.753
Other students took
the Visitor's Tour.

00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:31.261
We're here because Kanzaki
insisted on waiting for you.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.766
Because I'm her best friend.

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:35.131
Urumi!

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.704
Are you done?
Or are you on break?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.908
Well, I...

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.369
We've decided not to take this job.
It's meaningless anyway.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.447
What?!

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:47.515
Toroko!

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:48.605
Tomoko!

00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:50.617
You don't need to worry!

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:51.886
Tomoko!

00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:53.921
What's going on?

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.751
Let's find Toroko first!

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:01.056
I'm telling you,
I didn't see a woman in blue clothes!

00:07:01.163 --> 00:07:03.688
Not blue clothes.
A woman in red clothes!

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.426
And with yellow hair!

00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:07.900
With yellow hair...I know
only Hiyoko (baby chicken).

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.730
Okay! Check the monitor!

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.828
Teacher!

00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.533
I'm sorry. You even gave me a ride.
But I was cut.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.812
Why is the person
who was cut still here?

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:24.209
This story is really interesting.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.580
I read the script
over and over last night.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.086
So I overslept...

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:33.220
Then it's too early to give up.

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:36.824
The show hasn't finished taping yet.

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:39.666
- Did you find her?!
- No!

00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:42.062
Where on earth did she go?

00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:45.438
Please don't kill yourself, Tomoko!

00:07:46.308 --> 00:07:50.369
Thank you for waiting.
Oolong tea float &amp; plum milk ice.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.046
Tomoko!

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:53.114
Toroko!

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:57.049
I'm telling you! The light
on Ultraman's chest changes...

00:07:57.152 --> 00:07:58.881
...from blue to yellow, then to red.

00:07:59.154 --> 00:08:00.143
Kikuchi...

00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:01.482
No.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.357
Ultraman's...

00:08:05.494 --> 00:08:06.722
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:10.963
All right! Cut!
Not bad...!

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.334
Thank you very much!

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:16.861
What's going on?
Wasn't Toroko cut?

00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:18.599
Onizuka did it.

00:08:19.074 --> 00:08:21.065
How did you do it?

00:08:22.777 --> 00:08:25.439
That old lady said
you're her type.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:26.536
What?

00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.045
Do you mean...?

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:36.046
Everything is experience.
Good luck, Kunio-chan!

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.919
Why me?!

00:08:39.327 --> 00:08:43.855
Just drive the metropolitan highway
and drink morning coffee together...

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.366
What?!

00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:48.495
Mom...!

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.102
Eikichi!

00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:52.397
Bow wow!

00:08:52.707 --> 00:08:53.935
Teacher...!

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.532
Bow wow...!

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:56.536
OBEDIENT DOG

00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:58.306
OBEDIENT DOG
I'm asking you about that.

00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:04.119
OBEDIENT DOG
Good boy, Eikichi.
What do you want for your prize?

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.450
OBEDIENT DOG

00:09:05.554 --> 00:09:08.853
You want me to give her
more work time?

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:13.218
Okay, then. I'll make her role
a semi-regular one.

00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:16.562
What are you doing?!

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.878
I finally got Toroko some work!
Don't interfere!

00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:26.623
All right...

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.385
No! I'm her manager!

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:34.192
Don't accept any work
that's not in my plan!

00:09:34.632 --> 00:09:35.929
Plan?

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.590
Do you mean this?

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.499
Don't look!

00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:44.632
Here...

00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:50.276
This is an unrealistic plan...

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.273
Can he do that?

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.544
I have 20 years of experience
following stars.

00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:56.517
I was the president of
the Idol Fan Club at Meiji University.

00:09:56.621 --> 00:09:58.350
Nothing is impossible for me.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.982
You shut up and watch me.

00:10:02.927 --> 00:10:03.985
I don't like it.

00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:05.062
What?

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.796
As long as things go the way
you planned...

00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:09.797
...you don't care
what Toroko wants, do you?

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:12.532
What Tomoko wants...?

00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:15.701
We can't leave Toroko with you.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.574
Oh, my plan...!

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.138
From now on, we, Eikichi Onizuka
and these five students...

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.581
...will take care of Toroko.

00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:28.652
What?

00:10:28.953 --> 00:10:31.421
Are we joining him, too...?

00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:33.490
Sounds like it...

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.351
What can amateurs do?

00:10:36.727 --> 00:10:40.629
Although we're amateur, we know
Toroko's charms better than you.

00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:44.059
Interesting. If you say so,
I want you to do it.

00:10:44.969 --> 00:10:46.266
However...

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.928
... if you fail...

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:50.906
...you promise to never show up
at Tomoko's workplace.

00:10:51.008 --> 00:10:52.498
That's fine.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.546
I'll show you Onizuka's way!

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:00.702
FUJI TV! WOW!

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.640
The first step toward becoming
a star is doing a commercial!

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.847
Kyonkyon, Gokumi, and Hirosue...

00:11:07.948 --> 00:11:09.745
...all of them became famous
through commercials.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.508
I was in a commercial
for cell phones!

00:11:13.854 --> 00:11:16.880
One is not enough.
You have to do a lot!

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:22.857
That's easy for you to say.
Can you get commercials so easily?

00:11:23.097 --> 00:11:25.793
Yeah. I think it's pretty hard.

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:27.924
Who do you think I am?

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:32.296
I'm the legendary Onibaku.
I have many connections.

00:11:32.406 --> 00:11:35.204
Many connections
in many different areas.

00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:36.503
Then...!

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.477
I already have a job for her.

00:11:40.314 --> 00:11:42.043
Let's start rehearsal!

00:11:42.282 --> 00:11:43.340
Yes!

00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:46.719
Delicious daikon! Fun daikon!

00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:49.378
The best daikon I can find...

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.948
...is daikon in Gunma!

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.091
It's thick and hard.

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:00.064
Let's check the monitor.

00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:04.702
Thick...and hard...

00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:09.501
Where do you run this commercial?

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.599
Gunma Local.

00:12:12.412 --> 00:12:15.279
It'll be a long road to stardom.

00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:18.718
You can't be serious!

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:22.584
Many years from now,
people will use this commercial...

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:24.520
...to make fun of Tomoko!

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:27.889
I can't allow that!

00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.494
Tomoko, let's go back.

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:32.689
It's delicious!

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.494
Please eat as much as you want.

00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:36.362
It's good!

00:12:37.404 --> 00:12:39.702
Why don't you join us,
Manager-san?

00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.640
To...Tomoko...

00:12:43.377 --> 00:12:46.505
She's enjoying it.
Don't disturb her!

00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.405
Then let's take it!

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:50.683
Three seconds!

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.289
Delicious daikon! Fun daikon!

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.154
The best daikon I know...

00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:02.456
...is the daikon in Gunma!

00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:06.028
It's thick and hard.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.260
Okay!

00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:14.767
Don't get so mad.
We got a lot of daikon, too.

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:18.605
I will never allow a local
commercial like this!

00:13:19.112 --> 00:13:22.445
Don't worry.
The next one is a major commercial.

00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:27.917
Please eat with me!

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:30.418
Please eat...

00:13:30.524 --> 00:13:32.048
...with me...

00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:38.020
KOSHIHIKARI
Where do you air this commercial?

00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:42.603
KOSHIHIKARI
Niigata Local.

00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:45.936
Don't worry.
The next one is a major commercial!

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:50.671
Mellow melon!

00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:53.175
Mellow...

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.508
...melon...

00:13:57.484 --> 00:13:59.145
Hokkaido Local.

00:14:01.188 --> 00:14:04.180
We won't be out of food for a while!

00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:06.122
Hooray!

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:12.095
What is Onizuka thinking?!
He got only local commercials!

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:15.300
Major commercials are
an impossible dream.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.165
No, not really.

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.628
What?

00:14:20.474 --> 00:14:24.342
I totaled the areas
of the commercials Onizuka got.

00:14:24.578 --> 00:14:25.772
It's amazing.

00:14:26.813 --> 00:14:29.043
They cover over 80% of the country.

00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:30.240
What did you say?!

00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:34.114
We can expect the same effect
as a nation-wide commercial.

00:14:34.988 --> 00:14:37.513
Did Onizuka really plan that well?

00:14:39.893 --> 00:14:42.020
Everyone, get ready!
We got another job.

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:44.455
Which local commercial
are we doing this time?

00:14:44.998 --> 00:14:48.900
What? Local commercial?
No more of those.

00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:50.663
It's meaningless now.

00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:54.402
This time, it's a bigger job.
Radio station!

00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:55.839
Radio station in Shibuya.

00:14:56.043 --> 00:14:59.012
ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION &amp; TALENT
AGENCY PINK ELEPHANT A job at a
radio station in Shibuya!!

00:14:59.012 --> 00:15:01.003
The only radio station
in Shibuya is...!

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:08.549
I can't believe he got
such a major job...!

00:15:09.122 --> 00:15:11.590
I haven't even
contacted that station...!

00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:13.357
Here it is!

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:15.728
What? Isn't it a little bit further?

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:20.698
What's this place?

00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:22.063
Is this the right place?

00:15:24.571 --> 00:15:26.630
This is a Mini FM Station!

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.831
What's a Mini FM Station?

00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:31.810
It's a broadcasting station
anyone can establish easily.

00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:36.581
But the range of reception
is at most a few kilometers.

00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:39.776
Then it's meaningless...

00:15:40.053 --> 00:15:42.385
I thought it was too good to be true.

00:15:42.489 --> 00:15:45.287
No complaining!
Let's get to work!

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:49.786
Toroko's finished changing.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.421
But... is this really the right one?

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:03.673
What's this outfit?!

00:16:03.777 --> 00:16:05.836
I borrowed it from my friend.

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:07.607
It looks good on her, doesn't it?

00:16:07.748 --> 00:16:10.683
That's not my point!
This is a live broadcast in public!

00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:14.028
People can see it! Her pa-pa-

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.229
Don't worry about her panties.

00:16:16.334 --> 00:16:18.962
It's a sort of service.
A service for the fans.

00:16:20.204 --> 00:16:21.762
Fans...?

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.142
This is...!

00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:30.271
This program is well-known
for debuting future stars...

00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:32.315
... before their big break.

00:16:32.483 --> 00:16:35.816
Think about if all of them submit
their photographs to magazines.

00:16:36.153 --> 00:16:38.883
About 20 magazines soliciting
photographs from the public...

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.652
...will be filled with Toroko's photos.
Good advertising!

00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:46.559
Get serious! If she becomes famous
like that, my plan won't work!

00:16:46.864 --> 00:16:48.832
Cancel this job!

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.228
- Let's go back, Tomoko.
- What?

00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:55.062
Wait a minute!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.201
This is Toroko's job.

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:01.701
If she doesn't like it,
I have no intention of forcing her.

00:17:02.046 --> 00:17:03.445
I...

00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:07.377
Tomoko,
you don't need to take this job.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.716
They're going to take pictures
of you in your panties.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:16.825
Well...that's okay.
I've put on some nice underwear.

00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:18.929
That's not the point!

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.122
Toroko.

00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:24.462
What do you want to do?
Tell us. Be honest.

00:17:25.903 --> 00:17:26.995
Well...

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:32.131
Since you became my manager,
I've had many different jobs.

00:17:32.943 --> 00:17:34.911
I've enjoyed every single day.

00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:37.373
I've felt a sense of fulfillment.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.478
They might not be big jobs
like Manager-san said...

00:17:44.088 --> 00:17:48.286
... but even if it's little by little,
I want everyone to see me.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:54.095
If they like me little by little,
I will be very happy.

00:17:54.498 --> 00:17:57.695
So I will be happy...

00:17:57.802 --> 00:18:02.171
...if someone likes me
because of today's job...

00:18:04.308 --> 00:18:09.610
I'm sorry!
I know you care about me. But...

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:12.712
I remember...

00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:16.116
...Mayu Hazuki got her start
from a dinner show at hot springs...

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.781
Then, that's it.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.820
Now I'm introducing the guest
of the hour! Tomoko Nomura!

00:18:26.764 --> 00:18:29.824
How do you do?
I'm Tomoko Nomura.

00:18:35.106 --> 00:18:39.065
After all, that's my selfish dream...

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.844
I should have come up
with a marketing method...

00:18:43.948 --> 00:18:45.882
...suitable for Tomoko.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.482
Look! What's that?!

00:18:52.156 --> 00:18:53.214
That is...!

00:19:00.064 --> 00:19:01.759
Look! Right there!

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.500
The beauty of our dreams
really exists, Kibayashi!

00:19:05.736 --> 00:19:07.101
Yes! Let's go!

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.264
Who are you?!

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.336
Are you with the girl
who's on the air now?

00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:16.068
Yes...

00:19:20.418 --> 00:19:22.852
I'm Kibayashi
from Weekly Shonen Magazine.

00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:25.955
We've been receiving...

00:19:26.157 --> 00:19:28.785
...a lot of letters
about her commercials...

00:19:28.926 --> 00:19:33.124
...from readers all over Japan
for a long time now.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.494
"There is a cute girl
in the daikon commercial."

00:19:37.701 --> 00:19:40.534
"I want to know about that
beautiful girl in the rice commercial."

00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:45.469
"I've become mellow
from the melon commercial."

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.635
When we investigated...

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:52.510
...we found that it's the same
beautiful girl in all the commercials.

00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:56.113
Tomoko Nomura, it's you!

00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.221
From these facts,
we've hypothesized...

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:03.419
...that she may become
the top star of the 21st century!

00:20:04.094 --> 00:20:05.220
Weekly Shonen Magazine...

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:09.129
...the most widely circulated
magazine in the world...

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.030
...recognized Tomoko...

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.363
Great, Toroko!
No doubt you can be the top star!

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.334
But this is just a hypothesis.

00:20:19.443 --> 00:20:22.674
We need to research more deeply.

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:26.413
Research...?

00:20:27.418 --> 00:20:31.616
We've found 11 other
potential top idols.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.624
Adding Tomoko-kun Nomura...

00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:37.592
...we want these 12 to compete
for true star status.

00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:39.529
How...?

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:44.225
Magazine Glossy Princess Contest!
In short, MGPC!

00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:45.697
MGPC?!

00:20:46.303 --> 00:20:50.103
Yes. We'll introduce
all 12 girls in our magazine.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:55.611
We'll ask our readers to vote
for the top star of the 21st century.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.716
The winner will appear
in a 20-page layout...

00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:03.150
...in our magazine,
and we'll give her full support.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.118
We want her to compete.

00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:14.926
What do you want to do?
It's up to you to make the decision.

00:21:15.533 --> 00:21:18.366
I trust you.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.370
Okay!

00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:23.666
Let's do it together!

00:21:23.774 --> 00:21:25.799
Yes! I'll do it!

00:21:48.227 --> 00:21:52.994

Let's show them a miracle!

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:29.458
If you say so,
a miracle will happen again!

00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:32.758
