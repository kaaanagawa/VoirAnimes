00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:12.181
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:17.370
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:24.178
This street makes me love

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:27.947
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:33.086
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:38.459
Cars don't look they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.736
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:49.304
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:55.378
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.784 --> 00:01:01.154
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:06.520
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:11.688
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.568
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:23.141
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:23.244 --> 00:01:26.941
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:45.411
Uh... nothing really...

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.143
It was just a little mischief
by a student...

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:51.176
Really... it's nothing major
to bother the police with.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:55.482
Fortunately there were no injuries
to the students...

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:58.459
... but under these circumstances,
we won't be able to resume classes.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:00.927
Indeed. There is no way
we can get back to class.

00:02:01.898 --> 00:02:04.662
Kanzaki...
What in the world happened...

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:06.367
... with that teacher?

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:14.270
Yes!

00:02:17.947 --> 00:02:19.710
Good evening, Fujimori-sensei.

00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:23.785
Nomura-san...
and everyone?!

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:29.688
Hello. Eikichi Onizuka.
22 years old. A bachelor.

00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:38.055
Oh! It sure looks like
a mature woman's room.

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:39.824
Whoa!

00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.000
I'll get tea ready.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.673
Ah, no. Please don't bother...

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.203
Hey, Tomoko!

00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:50.437
Since you're a girl,
go help your teacher.

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:51.605
Yes.

00:02:52.282 --> 00:02:55.308
Teacher...I've come to help.

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:57.379
Uh, thank you.

00:02:57.587 --> 00:02:59.487
So, what can I do?

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.855
Hmmm...
this drawer looks suspicious...

00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:07.391
What are you doing?

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.523
Don't you want to know, too?

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.931
The appeal of a mature woman...

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.401
The appeal of a mature woman?

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:22.600
How can you do that?
You're a teacher!

00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:25.078
Uh... is that so?

00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:27.810
Then it's O.K.
I'll look by myself.

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:31.746
Wait! No one said
we wouldn't look!

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.289
Yeah, right.
Underwear...great!

00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:35.847
We WILL look!

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.556
Unbelievable...
What are we here for?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.490
Here we go!

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:42.997
Yeah, sure!

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.766
Huh? Differential calculus?

00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:52.900
Integral calculus?

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.904
INTEGRAL DIFFERENTIAL
CALCULUS CALCULUS

00:03:54.978 --> 00:03:56.673
Those are math subjects.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.711
Didn't you study them
in high school?

00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.873
Hmmm...

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.744
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:07.323
What are you doing, Teacher?

00:04:07.657 --> 00:04:08.885
Uh...those are...

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.517
Uh...um...it's not like...

00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:14.859
...I found those while looking
for your underwear or anything like that.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.165
But you're an eager learner.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.463
You're an elementary school teacher,
and yet...

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.401
...you have such high-level
reference materials...

00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:24.999
Kanzaki-san...

00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:29.002
I bought them
for the sake of Kanzaki-san.

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.341
URUMI KANZAKI

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:34.814
That girl used to come to this room
and study.

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.578
It's already been four years...

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:41.812
Could you tell us...

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:44.793
...what happened to Kanzaki?

00:04:47.764 --> 00:04:52.861
Back then I was fresh out of college
and I was her homeroom teacher.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.898
All right. I'm returning the exam
papers from the other day.

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.573
Yuck!

00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:02.233
I had heard from the principal
that Kanzaki was a prodigy.

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:06.042
In fact, she got a perfect score
on every single test.

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:08.441
Kanzaki-san, you did a great job.

00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:12.146
But she never showed...

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:13.712
...any happiness or emotion.

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:19.452
Kanzaki-san?

00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:23.696
Are the classes at school boring you?

00:05:25.802 --> 00:05:27.326
You can be honest.

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:29.364
A little...

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.440
Then would you like to come
to my place?

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.271
I can teach you higher-level subjects.

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:41.809
To be honest,
I bought these for you!

00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:44.110
Let's begin!

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.187
Ever since that day, she started
coming to my place every day.

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:55.494
Great!
You did such a good job!

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:00.393
As a reward, I'll give you
strawberry short cake!

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.800
Whoa! It looks delicious!

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:05.136
Gradually, she became cheerful.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:06.175

But one day...

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:13.482
Teacher, there are two ways
to solve this problem.

00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:15.380
Which one should I use?

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:18.578
What?
Um...let's see...

00:06:18.888 --> 00:06:20.617
It was such a shock...

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.683
...when I realized she excelled
far beyond the level I could teach.

00:06:25.828 --> 00:06:30.856
My pride would not allow me to say
"I don't know" to a student's question.

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:34.835
I studied extremely hard
to answer her questions.

00:06:38.174 --> 00:06:41.405
But I'm not a genius like she is.

00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.570
I soon reached my limit.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:52.046
I'm out right now. Please leave
a message after the beep.

00:06:53.923 --> 00:06:55.584
Hello. This is Kanzaki...

00:06:55.825 --> 00:07:01.525
I wanted to ask you a question.
I'll call you back later.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:06.461
What you are solving are
entrance exams for Tokyo University!

00:07:06.602 --> 00:07:08.695
There is no way I can solve them!

00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:16.142
Each time I saw Kanzaki's face
or heard her voice...

00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:19.010
... I felt as if I were being blamed
for my inabilities.

00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:23.983
My pride was completely shattered.

00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:27.421
Then that day came...

00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:32.961
Compared to this old pyramid,
King Khufu's pyramid is still intact...

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:35.224
...and looks great, doesn't it?

00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:36.354
Umm...yes...

00:07:36.466 --> 00:07:37.558
Teacher!

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:40.963
What...
What is it, Kanzaki-san

00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:43.837
That fallen pyramid belongs
to Senwosret III...

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:47.398
...and it was constructed
during the Middle Kingdom Dynasty.

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:49.638
So it is much newer
than King Khufu's pyramid...

00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:51.543
...built in the Old Kingdom Dynasty.

00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:54.249
It's the new one that's crumbled.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.719
It fell down because construction
skills had regressed and it is said...

00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:02.622
...that the regression is due
to the decline of the king's authority.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.991
Due to the decline
of the king's authority....

00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:11.795
Something inside me snapped
at that moment.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:16.031
Shut up! You SHUT UP!

00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:21.034
Shut up! You SHUT UP!

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.547
What is it? Are you saying my
authority as a teacher has declined?

00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:31.519
That's not what I...
It's just...you said something wrong...

00:08:32.188 --> 00:08:34.554
It's true that you are smart!

00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.988
But if you think about it,
it's natural, isn't it?

00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:42.186
Well, Teacher,
shall I tell you my secret?

00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:43.265
Because...

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:46.768
My mother told me never
to tell anyone, but...

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:47.803
You are...

00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:49.235
To tell you the truth, I am...

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:08.355
It was her secret which should
never have been revealed.

00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:20.233
It started several days later...

00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:24.296
...classroom terrorism
targeting the school and teachers.

00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:35.007
It's all my fault.

00:09:42.992 --> 00:09:44.084
Hmmm...

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:50.356
Would you like to sit down?

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:51.661
Huh? No.

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:52.928
Petty...

00:09:53.002 --> 00:09:53.969
What?

00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:56.328
That's unworthy of a prodigy.

00:09:56.506 --> 00:09:58.064
It's so small-minded.

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:01.005
You're wound too tight,
Urumi Kanzaki.

00:10:01.777 --> 00:10:03.074
Tight?

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.277
Nice room.

00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:08.076
Very feminine and warm.

00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:10.616
So different from my room.

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.481
Uh...thank you.

00:10:12.989 --> 00:10:19.519
Deep inside, you knew
why she was coming here every day.

00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:23.365
That's...but in the end...

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.528
...I was at fault.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:30.196
Teachers are human, too.
We make mistakes.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:35.066
But if you are stuck there,
you can't move on. Right?

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.042
Here we go!

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:41.041
My class at the end of the day
tomorrow is Social Studies, isn't it?

00:10:41.117 --> 00:10:42.106
Yeah.

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:46.219
O.K. Drag Kanzaki into that class
no matter what!

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:49.686
What are you going to do,
Onizuka-sensei?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.425
What am I going to do?

00:10:53.162 --> 00:10:55.722
I'm gonna teach Kanzaki a lesson...

00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:59.229
...on how to lighten up!

00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:01.167
As a teacher!

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.594

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:11.237
What...what are those sounds?

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:18.055
What...
What...is that?

00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:22.159
- Aren't they motorcycle gangs?
- I can see that myself!

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.900
Yesterday there was a chaotic
explosion and now motorcycle gangs...

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:29.503
Could this be a moon wobble
or bad biorhythms?

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:31.095
Call the police!

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:36.185
If we do that, it would bring
shame to our school!

00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:37.651
But...

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:40.979
Fukuroda, you go out there
and talk to them.

00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:43.250
You mean... me?

00:11:43.424 --> 00:11:46.825
It's a P.E. teacher's duty to take care
of this kind of situation!

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:48.528
Go!

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:50.392
But...

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.101

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:03.835

Come on out!

00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:06.839
Why do I need to dress like this...

00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:09.572
Kanzaki!
I'm telling you to come out!

00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:12.015
Is that...could it be...?

00:12:12.152 --> 00:12:14.347
Definitely! It's Onizuka!

00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.288
What is he doing?

00:12:16.357 --> 00:12:19.019
What are you gonna do?
Your teacher is calling you.

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:21.388
It's stupid!

00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:29.301

00:12:38.112 --> 00:12:41.673
Get on.
I'm gonna take you to a special class.

00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:43.011
Special class?

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:45.745
That's right.
Absence is not allowed.

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:47.116
Do whatever you like.

00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:49.816
Hurry up and go, Fukuroda-sensei.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.018
No. At a time like this,
someone with authority should...

00:12:53.093 --> 00:12:55.152
I'm nothing but a mere teacher...

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:56.355
They're leaving.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.397
What?

00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:04.968
What are we gonna do?

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:06.097
They're gone!

00:13:06.173 --> 00:13:07.367
We'll go after them.

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.007
How? They're on bikes!

00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:11.678
Hmm...

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:15.039
Good!
Heaven listened to my prayers!

00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:21.215
Vice Principal, Vice Principal,
please move your Cresta immediately.

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:25.053
The motorcycle gangs
are aiming at your Cresta.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.126
What?

00:13:26.193 --> 00:13:28.354
I repeat.
Please move your Cresta immediately.

00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:30.792
Did I hear they are aiming
at my Cresta?

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:34.358
I just got all the repairs done yesterday!

00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:36.926
I will never let even a finger touch it!

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.844
In this day and age
it's hard to believe...

00:13:44.912 --> 00:13:46.777
...there's someone
who would fall for this kind of trick.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.245
Get the car key before he wakes up!

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.249
You guys, what are you doing?

00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:52.780
Good! Saves us energy!

00:13:52.953 --> 00:13:54.147
What?

00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:01.058
How is it? Is it...
hitting you hard at all, Kanzaki?

00:14:04.732 --> 00:14:07.360
How is it? You must have taken
a good, hard look at yourself.

00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:10.830
What's significant
about that mannequin?

00:14:11.572 --> 00:14:13.563
Shut up! It's just for show!

00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:15.268
How do you like it?

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.204
It's silly.

00:14:18.278 --> 00:14:22.681
It will be a waste of time to make me
repent by scaring me! I'm not scared.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.843
Before I get scared...

00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:26.010
What?

00:14:26.353 --> 00:14:28.913
...I try to understand
the logistics behind it.

00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:32.421
Ghosts can be explained...

00:14:32.493 --> 00:14:34.791
...as illusionary images
created by autosuggestion.

00:14:34.862 --> 00:14:37.660
UFOs can be explained
with ignition of plasma.

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:42.498
Curse is a typical example of minus
placebo effects created by obsession.

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:44.161
Also, death is explainable!

00:14:46.373 --> 00:14:49.809
Teacher...
you know about my father. Right?

00:14:51.311 --> 00:14:53.506
That's right.
My mother didn't want to marry.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.107
She just wanted a smart child.

00:14:57.184 --> 00:14:59.277
I'm just a composite of protein...

00:14:59.353 --> 00:15:01.548
... born to a loveless union.

00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:05.391
A human being is nothing
but an ark of genes.

00:15:06.326 --> 00:15:09.420
So when you die,
you dissolve back to a mass of protein.

00:15:10.597 --> 00:15:11.689
That's all there is to it.

00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:16.964
You get scared because you wonder
what will become of you when you die.

00:15:17.604 --> 00:15:20.368
I see.
So you have nothing to fear...

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:21.966
That's right.

00:15:22.242 --> 00:15:25.405
But you were scared when you
were abandoned by Fujimori-sensei.

00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:26.741
Weren't you?

00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:31.716
What's that?
Don't joke with me.

00:15:32.352 --> 00:15:35.583
Why were you going
to Fujimori-sensei's place all the time?

00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:38.721
It... It was because of my pure
desire for knowledge.

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.953
She was teaching me
higher-level subjects.

00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:42.119
You're lying.

00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:46.432
Ugh...How can you say that?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.968
If you wanted, you could have
studied all by yourself.

00:15:49.737 --> 00:15:51.967
In fact, afterwards you were studying
by yourself, weren't you?

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:54.967
What's with an ark or protein?

00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:58.539
In short, you just wanted that teacher
to become a substitute parent.

00:15:58.612 --> 00:15:59.943
Isn't that right?

00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:02.445
It's a lie.
Don't make things up!

00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:06.344
You know all too well
that it's not a lie.

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:09.679
Didn't you want a room to go back to...

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.883
...a warm room to go back to?

00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:15.624
The time you got hurt the most was...

00:16:15.763 --> 00:16:19.164
...when Fujimori-sensei
abandoned you. Wasn't it?

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.701
You're out of your mind!

00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:24.132
What's with a genius?

00:16:24.204 --> 00:16:26.263
If you insist you didn't know...

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.400
...I'll make you notice
that you're just a student!

00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:30.500
What?

00:16:34.548 --> 00:16:36.243
Are you really all right?

00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:38.151
Don't talk to me!

00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:41.776
I can't believe you ask
a paper driver like me to drive!

00:16:42.322 --> 00:16:45.052
Whoaaa! Ouch!

00:16:45.292 --> 00:16:46.259
Oh, look!

00:16:46.827 --> 00:16:48.021
Right there!

00:16:48.095 --> 00:16:49.084
What?

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:53.628
Don't tell me this street is...

00:17:06.914 --> 00:17:08.609
Hey...
What do you think you're doing?

00:17:10.584 --> 00:17:13.519
Let's go...
Cross over to the other side!

00:17:16.824 --> 00:17:20.260
I've become a teacher,
but my students don't listen to me...

00:17:20.327 --> 00:17:21.954
...and I can't find a girlfriend.

00:17:22.095 --> 00:17:24.928
I'm getting kind of tired of living.

00:17:31.138 --> 00:17:33.197
Hmm...I see.

00:17:33.273 --> 00:17:35.332
You're going to hit the brake
at the last minute, aren't you?

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:37.240
You might think
you are threatening me...

00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:38.972
...but I'm not scared at all!

00:17:43.383 --> 00:17:45.214
You're not scared. Right?

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:47.478
People die at least once anyway.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:50.751
Let's smile and die, Kanzaki.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.613
Teacher!

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:29.320
- He's done it!
- Onizuka-sensei!

00:18:29.696 --> 00:18:32.392
- Teacher!
- Onizuka! Onizuka!

00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:37.234
Hey, are you alive? Eikichi!

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.271
What?

00:18:38.338 --> 00:18:39.965
All right.
We're gonna pull you up!

00:18:41.008 --> 00:18:44.671
Here you go. Pull harder!

00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:46.938
Phew. It was scary.

00:18:47.114 --> 00:18:51.175
We almost turned into a protein mass.

00:18:51.752 --> 00:18:54.653
Who said she wasn't afraid to die?

00:18:54.855 --> 00:18:57.847
Someone who pretends to understand
everything intellectually...

00:18:57.925 --> 00:18:59.017
... is very annoying!

00:18:59.393 --> 00:19:01.452
She's a coward!

00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:06.663
Such a coward, that she's afraid
even to live!

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.170
Everything he does is so elaborate...

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.298
Phew!

00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:17.604
I was really scared!

00:19:20.614 --> 00:19:21.581
Hmm?

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:23.081
Ah! The car!

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.875
Shit! Catch it! Whoa!

00:19:25.953 --> 00:19:27.011
Wait!

00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:29.647
Outrageous!

00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:32.292
I can't believe
that was the special class!

00:19:33.327 --> 00:19:35.090
But somehow I feel relieved.

00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:40.598
I haven't cried this much in years.

00:19:57.184 --> 00:20:00.051
You wanna go back...
to how you were, right?

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.799
With that female teacher...

00:20:06.105 --> 00:20:08.801
You want to cleanse yourself,
to tell her the truth. Right?

00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:13.112
You're so dumb!
Who, at this age...

00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:17.206
You want to have a piece of cake
like you used to, right?

00:20:17.314 --> 00:20:18.372
Who told you?

00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:20.982
You said so.

00:20:21.051 --> 00:20:22.109
I didn't.

00:20:22.185 --> 00:20:23.174
You did.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.324
I did NOT!

00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:30.505
Petty...Kanzaki...

00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:36.611
It's understandable
that you've lost trust in others.

00:20:37.053 --> 00:20:39.317
But it's such a loss
not to enjoy the moment...

00:20:39.422 --> 00:20:41.083
...just because you're
still stuck in the past.

00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:45.426
Come on.
How come you still look sad?

00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:46.653
Cheer up.

00:20:47.863 --> 00:20:49.626
You're a kid. Act like one!

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:55.133
Grin and move on.
All right, Kanzaki?

00:21:01.377 --> 00:21:05.404
O.K., this is the end
of the special class by Eikichi Onizuka.

00:21:05.781 --> 00:21:06.748
Teacher...

00:21:06.816 --> 00:21:07.783
What?

00:21:08.284 --> 00:21:10.309
Could you teach me
how to ride a bike?

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.753
Fuyutsuki-sensei,
did you put the emergency brake on?

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.056
What's that?

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.620
My deepest sympathies.

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:26.199
Look at that, everyone!

00:21:26.268 --> 00:21:28.361
What are they doing?

00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:29.661
It's fun!

00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:33.436
Hey, wait!
My clothes are stuck! I'm gonna die!

00:21:48.651 --> 00:21:53.384
You can't love everyone

00:21:53.556 --> 00:21:56.616
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.893 --> 00:22:00.795
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.963 --> 00:22:06.196
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:10.764
Just stay innocent

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.976
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:15.244 --> 00:22:23.117
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:27.914
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:33.186
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:37.422
What is there for me to do?

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:41.467
It may be small now

00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:45.630
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:49.470
A tear is about to drop

00:22:49.812 --> 00:22:53.748
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:54.016 --> 00:22:57.611
Live strong every moment

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:03.759
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:17.473 --> 00:23:19.100
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:19.175 --> 00:23:22.269
Make sure you respond to her.
She's waiting for your reply.

00:23:24.013 --> 00:23:28.643
My student's in love.
Got to help him.

00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:32.513
That's not the point!
It's feelings! Feelings!

00:23:32.755 --> 00:23:36.247
You're not gonna understand
my feelings!

00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:38.985
If I can be of any help, go ahead
and do it until you're satisfied.

00:23:40.229 --> 00:23:41.253
Whoa...

00:23:41.664 --> 00:23:44.462
Girls are like that.

00:23:44.533 --> 00:23:47.127
We can't be confident
in front of someone we like.
