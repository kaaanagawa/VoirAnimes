WEBVTT

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:11.197
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.919
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:23.408
This street makes me love

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:27.121
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.123
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.666
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.567
And today, I get on the subway
like always

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:49.677
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:54.879
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.288 --> 00:01:00.385
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:05.757
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:11.501
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:19.639
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.305
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.374
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:48.859
Good afternoon. It's July 22nd.
This is the news at noon.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.227
First, we have a report
about a groom imposter...

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.268
... who appeared
at the chapel in Kichijoji...

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.373
... around 3:00 p. m. yesterday.

00:01:57.342 --> 00:02:00.709
The unidentified imposter
disappeared from the chapel.

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.070
He has been missing ever since.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.380
The real groom is also missing.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.652
There is a possibility
that foul play may be involved...

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.381
... and the police have
begun an investigation.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.687
Next on the news.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.053
The other day...

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:20.325
... a bride came to Tom-Tom,
the panda at the Kitano Zoo.

00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:23.292
He hasn't shown
any interest in the bride...

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.965
... but is instead interested in
a female polar bear in the next cage.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:27.736
- What's wrong with everyone?!
- If this continues, people worry...

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.329
... his offspring
won't be black &amp; white...

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.907
... but will instead
be a plain white bear.

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:32.532
The Zoo staff are discussing...

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:34.975
- Everyone makes fun of me!
-... what measures to take.

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:39.649
This Zoo had a similar
incident once before...

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.945
What?!

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:43.311
... when a penguin
was attracted to a swan...

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:45.956
Yes, you can choose your swimsuit.

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.490
But you should avoid...

00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:50.117
...anything that isn't
appropriate for your age.

00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:52.719
I'm glad! For this trip to Okinawa...

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.628
... I was worried that we could
only wear a school swimsuit.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.165
Excuse us.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.099
Let's go to Marui on the way home.

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:01.968
Shoot! What a shame!

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:04.631
Kadena-sensei
isn't going to Okinawa.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.801
I want to see that
nice body in a swimsuit!

00:03:07.912 --> 00:03:11.075
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, but Fuyutsuki-sensei is going!

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.514
Idiot! Why would I want
to see Fuyutsuki-sensei's body?

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.608
Well...

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.655
Her face is cute,
but with those small boobs...

00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:21.224
...even if she wears a swimsuit,
she won't look sexy at all.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.519
That's true. Her shape is
like a kid in elementary school.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:28.061
Some of the girls in our class
have much bigger breasts.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.164
She would look better
in the school swimsuit.

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:31.235
You're right!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.277
Well, I can understand
the kids' focus on women's breasts.

00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:49.386
A woman's appeal is not
based just on her breasts.

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:52.946
I don't want everything
to be determined by the breasts.

00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:57.092
I'm going to Okinawa.
How can I be depressed?

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:02.356
All right. I'm going
to get a new swimsuit.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.634
Good. I'm starting to feel better.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.367
Well, which one should I take...?

00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:20.077
Well, as an adult, and a teacher,
I can forgive the students.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.084
I can't forgive this man!

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:26.952
What?!
Aren't you going, Kadena-sensei?

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.820
It won't be fun!

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.520
I've heard you'll be staying at
a posh hotel with an excellent clinic.

00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:33.425
So whatever happens,
you don't have to worry.

00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:36.195
I just feel bad that
I can't show off my swimsuit.

00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:39.231
That's it! That's the point!
Everyone was looking forward to it.

00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:43.437
Huh, are you interested in it, too?
Me in my swimsuit?

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.040
Of course.

00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:47.542
Is it as great as I imagine?

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.346
Of course!

00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:52.972
Wow! Just imagining it
gives me a nosebleed.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:57.180
You're disgusting! Even though
I can't, Fuyutsuki-sensei's going.

00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:58.680
Fuyutsuki?

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:01.951
Yeah, that's true. But...

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:07.689
Just between you and me,
Fuyutsuki's boobs are small.

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.798
So even if she wears a swimsuit,
she won't look like a real woman.

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:14.701
That's a terrible thing
to say about Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:19.970
But a great swimsuit is
a result of the breasts.

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:23.614
If a body has big breasts
and a narrow waist...

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:25.683
... I'll get excited!

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:29.844
But if it's a straight line
from the top to bottom...

00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:30.988
... it's like a burdock root.

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.920
STRAIGHT LIKE A BURDOCK ROOT
(FLAT-CHESTED)

00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:41.461
Darn you! I'm sorry
that I'm a burdock root!

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.331
Just watch me!
Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old!

00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:46.536
I'll show you how the burdock
root survives in this world!

00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:48.830
And watch out, Okinawa!

00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:50.965
With my new swimsuit...

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:52.872
...all of the men's eyes
will be glued on me!

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.847
I wonder if this is too flashy...

00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:09.659
Look at that! That older woman
is trying to look young...

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:11.955
Quiet. She can hear you.

00:06:12.063 --> 00:06:13.690
But she's choosing
a really flashy design...

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:17.029
...that won't fit
unless she has a nice body.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.735
The sunflower
on the chest may wither...

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.102
If you're wearing one in Okinawa...

00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:30.044
...it's better to choose one which
reflects the sunshine, because...

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:32.778
...the light gives you
a sense of proportion...

00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:34.476
...and your body looks nicer.

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:36.217
Kadena-sensei...

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.412
What a coincidence!

00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:42.590
Well, with which swimsuit
should I attack the summer...?

00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:44.926
What about you?
Did you find anything good?

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.996
Well...

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.195
Nothing is quite right for me...

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:49.655
Really...?

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.001
There isn't a swimsuit that looks
good on a burdock root, is there?

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:57.672
Oh, you heard him...

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.469
That's all right.
Onizuka is the bad one...

00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:03.040
You defended me...

00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:06.412
He didn't say that
with any mean intent.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.143
It was just a joke.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:12.049
I hope Onizuka gets eaten
by a shark in Okinawa.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.159
But because of him
everyone can go to Okinawa.

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:18.351
And you're staying at a luxurious
resort hotel on the beach...

00:07:18.463 --> 00:07:20.055
...with a show of habu
and mongoose.

00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:21.597
Habu is good, too.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.257
I hope it bites him.

00:07:25.703 --> 00:07:29.298
I thought Onizuka was great...

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:30.441
What?

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:35.004
To tell you the truth, I've heard that
the students initiated the incident.

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:37.007
This is a secret, you know.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:40.382
But he didn't let on about any of it.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.577
He is amazing.

00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:45.050
He accepted all responsibility...

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:48.557
...and he made allies of the students
who were denouncing him.

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:55.031
I can't follow in his footsteps.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.258
Whether being silent about
the incident is the right thing to do...

00:07:57.368 --> 00:07:58.494
...is a different issue.

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:02.633
But I wonder what gives him
the ability to draw people to him.

00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:06.165
It really is a mystery.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:11.639
But he called me a burdock root!
I can't forgive him!

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:13.273
- Onizuka!
- Well, well, calm down.

00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:17.248
For whatever reason, you can't
help thinking of Onizuka-sensei.

00:08:19.023 --> 00:08:21.048
I see.

00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:23.754
You like Onizuka-sensei, don't you?

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:28.226
No, no!

00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:29.856
He's just my colleague.

00:08:30.067 --> 00:08:32.467
When just a colleague speaks
about someone behind her back...

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.763
...she shouldn't get mad like you do.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.132
I'm just...

00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:38.970
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:42.139
What's wrong with a love affair
at the workplace?

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:45.147
There are some people hiding
their relationships at our school.

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:47.444
- But I'm saying...
- Here!

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.985
In this case, leave
choosing your swimsuit to me!

00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:52.385
Here we go.

00:08:52.557 --> 00:08:55.617
I'll pick a great one
dripping with femininity!

00:08:56.694 --> 00:08:58.355
Femininity!
I can't wear something.!

00:08:58.462 --> 00:08:59.429
You can't win like that!

00:09:00.298 --> 00:09:02.323
Listen! Your swimsuit
is a battle uniform.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.994
Battle uniform?

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:11.165
- I'm not going to Okinawa for war...
- No!

00:09:11.442 --> 00:09:13.239
This is your war.

00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:15.707
We have to pick your battle
uniform with lots of thought!

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.939
You must show your
feminine side once in a while.

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:19.016
Otherwise, you'll never attract him.

00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.682
Feminine side?

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:23.820
Now...

00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:27.818
I'll make you try on many of these.
Hold this and this...

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:29.927
But I am...

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:32.120
Never mind! Hey, Miss.!

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.629
- Well...
- We'd like to try some...

00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:37.030
- Which one would you like to try?
- All of the ones she's holding now...

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.691
Come this way.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:41.130
Feminine side...

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.775
BURDOCK ROOT FOR LIFE

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.748
What do you think?

00:10:01.398 --> 00:10:02.626
One moment.

00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:05.092
I'm going to imagine Okinawa.

00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:14.976
Well... How is it?

00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:20.212
I'll be blunt...

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:22.242
It's weak.

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:24.020
Weak?

00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:27.149
You look like a pupil
on a school trip to the sea.

00:10:27.557 --> 00:10:29.149
It's on the level of Katsuura beach.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:33.390
Really? For me this is a much
more adventurous suit than usual.

00:10:33.563 --> 00:10:34.530
Where?!

00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:37.667
Look. Here the leg is cut a bit high.

00:10:38.034 --> 00:10:39.626
You don't have something showy...

00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:45.974
Something flashy...
Like an aphrodisiac to attract men...

00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:49.905
Next! You bought
two more, didn't you?

00:10:51.114 --> 00:10:54.015
Do you always buy
several suits like this?

00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.419
This is the first time
I've bought three suits at once.

00:10:57.521 --> 00:10:59.614
These are battle uniforms.

00:10:59.723 --> 00:11:02.521
Based on the conditions,
you need to change them.

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:03.593
Conditions?

00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:07.089
For example, if you take it off
right away in Onizuka's room...

00:11:07.197 --> 00:11:08.255
...a bikini is better...

00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:09.693
I won't take it off!

00:11:11.668 --> 00:11:12.635
You won't?

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:14.064
Of course not!

00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:17.103
If you're not serious about this,
you should say so!

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.071
There's no need to pick a swimsuit.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.003
No, that isn't right. I mean...

00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:24.103
You want to show your
feminine side, don't you?

00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:26.282
Yes...

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:28.444
Then this is next!

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.654
This may be a bit too much...

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.124
I'm a teacher
supervising the students...

00:11:40.397 --> 00:11:42.695
It isn't too much, it's too little.

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:48.300
Oh, no. I won't comment because
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

00:11:49.873 --> 00:11:51.602
What's the matter, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:11:52.843 --> 00:11:53.810
Nothing...

00:11:54.244 --> 00:11:56.235
Cheer up! Let's try the last one!

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:03.508
I tried to be different
and went with a classical look...

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.054
... but this looks more like
a prisoner from the old days.

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.987
Sorry, sorry. I guess
I was thinking too much.

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:16.254
Fuyutsuki-sensei...?

00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:21.236
Kadena-sensei, are you
enjoying making fun of me?

00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:25.701
No, not at all! I'm thinking of you!

00:12:26.276 --> 00:12:29.803
What should I do?
We're leaving tomorrow.!

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.446
I guess we have
to go with this swimsuit...

00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:39.647
But if I look like
a pupil on a school trip...

00:12:40.557 --> 00:12:43.253
I'm sorry. I knew it
when you tried it on at the store.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.453
It's my fault that I didn't say anything
because I was trying to be polite.

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:47.187
I'll tell you bluntly.

00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:49.158
It's your breasts!

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.633
You don't have enough
volume in your breasts.

00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:55.030
Look. That is a one-piece.

00:12:55.538 --> 00:12:58.530
Without breasts, it looks
straighter than other kinds.

00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:01.137
Straighter...?!

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:03.670
I guess we need
to make your breasts.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.849
We need to insert pads
in there to make some cleavage.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.076
That's right!
In order to make a woman...

00:13:08.184 --> 00:13:09.276
... it comes down to the breasts!

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:10.512
Breasts! Breasts!

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.757
What's the matter?!

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:16.586
Your words are
worse than Onizuka's...

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:17.887
... because they are so direct.

00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:21.856
Cheer up!
You haven't lost the battle yet.

00:13:22.432 --> 00:13:25.299
That's right! I have
something good, Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:30.031
Tadaaaa! Here is
a woman's weapon, an air pad!

00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:31.474
Air pad?

00:13:31.675 --> 00:13:34.405
Yes! I just found it
and bought it today.

00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:37.245
The breast pad has
an air induction system.

00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:40.447
After you put it on,
you insert air with this.

00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:44.380
Your breasts will be pushed up,
and you can control their size.

00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:46.483
It's cheating, isn't it?

00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:47.623
That's all right.

00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:49.419
If you don't take them off,
no one will know about it.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:52.858
I'm going to the store again
to get the ones suitable for you.

00:13:53.196 --> 00:13:56.097
Yes, it's important
to make a decision!

00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:57.166
But.!

00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:00.829
Summer is a time
when a woman changes.

00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.502
Or are you thinking about
when you'll take it off?

00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:05.574
What?!

00:14:06.943 --> 00:14:08.274
Oh, wait! Kadena-sensei!

00:14:31.101 --> 00:14:32.068
All right.

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.612
This is a monster.

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:48.149
This much...? Oops, too small!

00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:50.446
This is the same as mine.

00:14:54.691 --> 00:14:56.591
These may be good.!

00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:00.990
Yes. If I had breasts, I'm not bad...

00:15:02.232 --> 00:15:03.460
Good! Good!

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:05.896
So this is what it's like
to have big breasts.

00:15:06.736 --> 00:15:08.169
Wonderful! Wonderful!

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.470
I'm the best!

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:17.846
Balloons won't work...

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.952
What's this?! Looks like a loincloth.

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:27.515
And it's silver.

00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:32.784
If she wears it, she'll get
arrested for public indecency.

00:15:33.363 --> 00:15:36.196
This is too much.
There are strings at each side.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.262
I can't believe it.

00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.862
Kadena-sensei wears
this kind of swimsuit.

00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:46.336
But... I wonder
if Onizuka likes this kind...

00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:56.909
Fuyutsuki...

00:15:58.054 --> 00:15:59.385
You are the type that looks thinner...

00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:01.081
...than you are
when you wear clothes.

00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:02.918
Is that right?

00:16:03.493 --> 00:16:05.290
Cheers to you who looks
thinner in clothes!

00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:08.463
Onizuka...

00:16:19.642 --> 00:16:21.633
What am I imagining?

00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:23.006
It makes me feel cheap!

00:16:23.113 --> 00:16:25.240
If I'm like this, I won't be
qualified to guide my students!

00:16:25.748 --> 00:16:26.840
Wait a minute.

00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:28.909
If I imagined that...

00:16:29.686 --> 00:16:32.382
...does it mean
I really like Onizuka...?

00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:37.553
Never mind that, but I'm
going to borrow it for a minute...

00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:38.820
Just for a moment...

00:16:47.403 --> 00:16:48.893
Wow.!

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.737
I don't know why,
but this is really sexy.

00:16:53.943 --> 00:16:56.343
This doesn't look like me!

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.905
I feel like an adult!

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:03.817
Surely I will be able to flaunt
my feminine side with this...

00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:17.356
It's really good! Your swimsuit.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:20.233
Really?

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:22.804
Yeah, you're the best.

00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:24.066
Especially that hair...

00:17:31.614 --> 00:17:39.919
FOR CERTAIN REASONS,
WE CANNOT SHOW THE IMAGE

00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:42.291
All right.

00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:43.849
Now it's perfect!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.151
In order to make a woman,
it comes down to the breasts!

00:17:46.329 --> 00:17:47.353
Breasts! Breasts!

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:51.489
I'm borrowing this, too!

00:17:56.639 --> 00:17:59.608
Wow! What a great swimsuit!
There's cleavage!

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:03.040
Now I won't let anyone call me
a burdock or withered sunflower!

00:18:04.113 --> 00:18:05.375
Here's an idea!

00:18:05.481 --> 00:18:07.972
If I make my hair color lighter
to match the swimsuit...

00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:09.582
I may even look cute!

00:18:15.592 --> 00:18:17.059
I may look too polished!

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.728
It may be too light.
But I guess it's okay.

00:18:25.668 --> 00:18:27.898
Wow! Sharon Stone!

00:18:28.304 --> 00:18:30.204
It doesn't look like me!

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.643
What shall I do?!
I'm getting excited!

00:18:34.777 --> 00:18:35.971
I've got an idea!

00:18:36.212 --> 00:18:39.477
Should I bleach my hair more?
Oh, I have to put on eye shadow...

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:41.913
Wear eyelashes!

00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:44.711
If I've gone this far, maybe
I should change my eyes to blue...

00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:46.482
This is fun!

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.755
Oh, with this swimsuit,
I should tan my body.

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:54.652
I think I have a tanning machine
that I won at Bingo...

00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:57.059
... when I went to the second party
for Yoshimi's wedding...

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.428
I'm going to do it! I will!

00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:06.065
I've found one!

00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:08.143
I've found the swimsuit
which is best for Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:19:08.244 --> 00:19:09.336
Here it is!

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:30.266
Who are you?!

00:19:31.968 --> 00:19:34.198
You're kidding me!
Are you Fuyutsuki-sensei?!

00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:37.003
What shall I do?!

00:19:39.075 --> 00:19:43.876
I can't go on a school trip
like this! Not with this style!

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.642
Wait! Calm down.
All right, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:50.378
What happened?
How did this happen? Talk to me.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.549
I did too much!
Too much! Too much!

00:19:54.824 --> 00:19:57.224
When I realized I look like this!

00:19:57.427 --> 00:20:00.885
Don't cry with those eyes
like a Hollywood actress!

00:20:00.997 --> 00:20:02.055
It's scary!

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:05.365
Anyway, we still
have time until morning.

00:20:05.668 --> 00:20:07.568
So cheer up! All right?

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:11.270
I tanned my skin! It's so dark! Dark!

00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:14.305
That's all right! Calm down.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.002
Oh, I have a good idea.

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:17.279
What...?

00:20:25.988 --> 00:20:28.047
Fuyutsuki-sensei is late...

00:20:28.758 --> 00:20:31.090
The meeting time
passed a long time ago.

00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.257
This is why young people
these days are...

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:36.830
Hello! Good morning!

00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:38.763
What?
Fuyutsuki-sensei hasn't come yet?

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:39.835
No...

00:20:40.236 --> 00:20:42.295
Women have to do a lot of things.

00:20:42.438 --> 00:20:43.632
Before going out...

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.330
...they have to choose
clothes, make-up, and so forth...

00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:46.408
Idiot!

00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:47.543
She's a teacher.

00:20:47.643 --> 00:20:49.702
What is she going to do
in such an unstable frame of mind?

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:51.346
I've brought Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:53.414
Oh, here she comes!

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.846
- Hey, Fuyutsuki-chan! Here! Here.!
- Fuyutsuki-sensei, we were worried...

00:20:57.019 --> 00:20:58.316
Why don't you get on your bus...?

00:20:59.322 --> 00:21:00.516
Anything wrong...?

00:21:06.796 --> 00:21:08.229
Onizuka...

00:21:10.466 --> 00:21:11.990
What is it?!

00:21:12.301 --> 00:21:13.393
Oh, (Beep) Suzuki!

00:21:18.408 --> 00:21:19.670
It's like I thought...

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.311
Like I thought.! Like I thought.!

00:21:23.446 --> 00:21:26.313
I'm not going!
I'm definitely not going!

00:21:26.449 --> 00:21:27.507
That's all right...

00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:29.014
That's all right!

00:21:31.487 --> 00:21:33.114
I'm not going!

00:21:47.937 --> 00:21:54.501
Where is our future going?

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:01.345
Maybe it knows of this aimless journey
And simply flew away

00:22:02.284 --> 00:22:08.621
If you can stop our gloomy days

00:22:09.425 --> 00:22:15.694
I will listen to all you say

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:23.363
However much we have,
There is always something lacking

00:22:24.073 --> 00:22:29.841
The wind will always blow
And carry the scent away

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:37.715
I am searching for our future now

00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:44.383
Don't laugh because
It may really go away

00:22:44.893 --> 00:22:52.129
Remember these
Strained words I say

00:22:53.202 --> 00:22:59.300
The night is almost over,
So let's run through this moment

00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:02.538
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:06.642
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:10.610
Before the endless night begins

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.216
Embrace this precious night

00:23:16.325 --> 00:23:19.089
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:19.194 --> 00:23:23.221
"A Boy Riding on a Dolphin"
by Michiru Jo!

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:28.493
He must be stupid!
He is old enough to know better!

00:23:28.837 --> 00:23:32.034
Under these circumstances,
how can I enjoy my time?

00:23:32.408 --> 00:23:35.434
For example...
why don't you hang yourself...?

00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:46.181
I'll make sure they have
a memorable time.

00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:54.228
SEE YA NEXT TIME
