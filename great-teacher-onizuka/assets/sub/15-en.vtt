WEBVTT

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.804
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.876
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:31.651
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:38.088
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.696
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:48.837
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:54.207
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.246
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:03.681
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:07.349
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:12.695
Toward the finish line

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:38.653
HOLY FOREST ACADEMY

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:40.986
What? Not here?
He hasn't come yet?

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:43.951
He left so early this morning!

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.321
If he's not just running late,
I wonder what happened.

00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:49.591
The exam is about to begin.

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.759
Onizuka-kun...

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:05.108
Oh, crap. I'm so unlucky.

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.776
When I don't have
much time to spare...

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:09.944
...I witness a kidnapping!

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:13.755
Boss, that paper delivery guy's
still following us.

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:16.223
He's so persistent!

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.429
Help...please...

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:32.203
What are we gonna do?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.874
He's like an annoying fly.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.971
Smash him dead
before it's too late!

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:38.182
Yes, sir.

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:50.993
You've done a horrible thing!
Murderers! No!

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:53.357
Oh, poor thing.
Well, let's go.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.404
1st PERIOD JAPANESE

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.811
FOR ONIZUKA ONLY

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:12.713
He's not here yet.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.484
What is he doing,
that Onizuka fellow?

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:18.119
If he doesn't score
the highest on this exam...

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.849
...he's gonna get fired on the spot.
Doesn't he know that?

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:24.361
Hey, it's exam time.
Be quiet!

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:25.790
Onizuka-sensei...

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:30.699
FACULTY ROOM

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:37.170
I really admire you,
Teshigawara-sensei.

00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:39.266
You're a graduate
of Tokyo University...

00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:41.140
...and you still have
a humble enough spirit...

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:42.439
...to take a Junior level exam.

00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:45.978
I also wanted to make sure
there are no errors in the questions.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.177
Whoa, wonderful.

00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:52.546
On the contrary, that guy
seems to have run away.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.124
Well, I guess
that's probably wiser...

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:57.558
...than making a big fool
of himself nationwide...

00:03:57.628 --> 00:03:59.357
... by scoring lowest
on the exam.

00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:05.034
Come on! What in the world
happened, Onizuka-sensei?

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:13.199
That's right. Gently...

00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:15.504
...cut up her clothes.

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:18.672
Are you too scared
to talk, young lady?

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.749
Don't worry.

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:24.515
Your daddy, the assemblyman,
treasures you.

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:26.884
Keep quiet
and you won't get hurt.

00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:32.725
This is a request to get your daddy
to do a little favor in his field.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.798
That's all there is to it.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:38.294
Hey, bring the video camera.

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:42.332
Oh, it's easy.

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:45.203
You just ask your daddy
to do us a favor.

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:47.801
Use a little sex appeal.

00:04:48.312 --> 00:04:49.802
When he sees you
in the tape...

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:52.245
... I'm sure
he will cooperate with us.

00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:56.079
If you want to go home safely...

00:04:56.187 --> 00:04:58.519
... I suggest you do
what I've told you to.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.751
Well, our young friends are
a little rough and impatient.

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:06.362
They give me a headache.

00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:08.294
Hey, hurry up
and bring the video camera!

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.899
Umm. It's nice.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.235
I wonder if X-rated videos
are shot like this.

00:05:16.307 --> 00:05:18.468
Well, spread your legs more...

00:05:19.043 --> 00:05:21.534
However, due to my
vocational obligation...

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:24.046
...I can't let such a thing
go on like this.

00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:30.119
What are you mumbling about?

00:05:30.287 --> 00:05:31.549
Ouch, ow...shit.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.452
Hey, come on, let's get it over with.
Sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:39.996
I'm supposed to be in the middle
of taking a national exam.

00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:41.630
Whoa, my nose...

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:47.298
Who the hell are you?
Are you trying to stop us? Huh?

00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.965
Which gang sent you? Bastard!

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.665
Gang?

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.676
Whoa!

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:01.910
I'm with Class 3-4!
You dummy!

00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:06.183
Ah...sorry!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.118
Please continue.
Never mind...

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.329
What happened?

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.391
Please, please hurry...
hurry and show up, Onizuka-sensei!

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:29.112
It's appalling! A supposedly
mature, middle-aged man...

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.981
...kidnaps a female student
and shoots a video?

00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.573
Don't you have any morals?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.447
What kind of mumbo-jumbo are
you talking about, you bastard?!

00:06:36.587 --> 00:06:39.420
Well, I rent "uniform tapes"
now and then...

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.320
... but if those videos
are made like this...

00:06:42.493 --> 00:06:44.120
...forcing kidnapped
girls to pose...

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:45.384
Wow!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.168
...as a humble teacher...

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.733
...I wouldn't be able
to enjoy them anymore!

00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:56.131
Here! This is a lesson
you won't forget!

00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:58.934
On behalf
of the Ministry of Education...

00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:01.772
Phew...

00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:04.346
...I can't believe it! What do
those guys think they're doing?

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:06.947
Hey, are you hurt anywhere?

00:07:08.452 --> 00:07:09.851
Behind you...

00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:14.414
This is not child's play,
all right, teacher?

00:07:14.492 --> 00:07:17.359
If you want to play your game,
do it in the afterlife.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.596
We're doing this without permission
from our boss...

00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:24.259
...and we're risking our lives, too.
So, we can't afford to stop now...

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:28.230
Sorry, but we need you
to disappear!

00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:31.204
Then, good-bye.

00:07:45.122 --> 00:07:46.680
One more period left.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:50.519
Don't tell me Onizuka will get fired
without even taking the exam.

00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:53.355
It'll work out.
He'll show up.

00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:55.297
I'm sure he will...definitely!

00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:58.067
Hmm...What will he do,
even if he does show up?

00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:02.195
It's impossible to answer every question
in all subjects in an hour.

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.400
Now, everyone,
please be seated.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.943
Fuyutsuki-sensei,
what is Onizuka doing?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.707
Why hasn't he shown up?

00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:13.008
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:08:13.184 --> 00:08:15.049
That's right!
Where is he?

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:16.776
What happened?

00:08:16.854 --> 00:08:19.789
You studied so hard...
nevertheless...

00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:21.316
Be quiet!

00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:22.893
Vice Principal!

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.928
If he's not here,
he's not here!

00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:27.730
That guy gave up on the exam!

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:33.635
Now he will definitely get fired!
Ha ha ha... hah?

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.410
Whoa! Onizuka-sensei!

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:47.577
Onizuka-sensei!

00:08:48.052 --> 00:08:49.815
Whoa! It's Onizuka!

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.486
Whoa! He showed up!
Gosh! We knew it!

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.179
Sensei!

00:08:58.128 --> 00:09:01.586
Vice Principal,
sorry to bother you...

00:09:01.732 --> 00:09:04.292
... but could you take her
to the infirmary?

00:09:05.102 --> 00:09:07.161
Hey, who is she?

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:11.601
Now, give me the exam papers,
Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.399
I don't have much time.

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.578
I need a perfect score
in all five subjects, right?

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.347
Yes! I'll go get the exam papers
in the other subjects, too.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:25.352
Now, please start
working on the last subject.

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.923
We're currently investigating
the crime scene...

00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:29.619
...in an abandoned building
at Naka-machi block...

00:09:29.693 --> 00:09:31.684
...in Musashino City.

00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:34.624
There seems to be several
critically injured people.

00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:37.631
Please send ambulances
right away. I repeat...

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:46.835
Ganbatte! (Good Luck)

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:51.275
Oh, my goodness! Phew.

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:52.382
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

00:09:53.284 --> 00:09:54.774
Who is she?

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:57.144
I wonder if that bastard Onizuka
was doing...

00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:59.246
...something indecent
to this girl...

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.157
Huh? Whoa!

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:05.120
Whoa! What is it?
What the hell is this?

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:06.553
Umm, umm...

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:10.462
Hmm...it doesn't look
like my own blood...

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:12.794
Where is he?
Onizuka-sensei!

00:10:13.037 --> 00:10:15.301
In the middle of taking an exam.

00:10:15.372 --> 00:10:17.670
But how in the world...

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.373
Hurry!
Take Onizuka-sensei to a hospital!

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:21.739
Take Onizuka?

00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:25.243
He got shot...with a pistol...
Three times!

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:29.409
Is that so?
A pistol...what?

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:33.856
O.K. That's it!

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:36.752
Finished! Done!
Ooh...we're free!

00:10:36.994 --> 00:10:39.053
All right. The person
at the end of each row...

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:40.892
...please collect
the answer sheets.

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:45.757
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.001
Thanks, Kikuchi.

00:10:49.907 --> 00:10:53.240
Wow, Onizuka-sensei answered
every question!

00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:56.908
All five subjects!
In only an hour! Amazing!

00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:58.343
Is it true?

00:11:01.719 --> 00:11:04.916
Studying so hard
really paid off, didn't it?

00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:08.247
Come on. Please wake up.
Onizuka-sense...

00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:16.391
Onizuka-sensei!

00:11:32.673 --> 00:11:33.731
Onizuka-kun...

00:11:48.022 --> 00:11:49.011
Principal...

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.081
You look very tired.

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:56.296
Why don't you go home?
I'll stay here in your place.

00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:57.895
But...

00:11:58.032 --> 00:11:59.397
He'll be fine.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.090
No matter what...
because Onizuka-sensei is...

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:03.965
...the "immortal hero"
of our school.

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.970
OPERATING ROOM

00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.999
Isn't it true?

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:13.145
Principal...

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:17.448
Come on.
Cheer up and stand tall.

00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:19.619
The most crucial moment
has yet to come...

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.084
...for Onizuka-sensei,
as well as for us.

00:12:24.425 --> 00:12:27.883
ATTENTION: CONCERNED PRESS

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:29.628
What a fool!

00:12:29.797 --> 00:12:32.357
He found a way
to get fired on his own.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.801
I didn't even have
to take the test.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.828
But I will press harder,
Onizuka!

00:12:41.142 --> 00:12:45.636
Even if you live, I'll make sure
you won't be able to survive socially.

00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:55.152
Please give us a comment...

00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:56.746
... on this case
from the school's standpoint.

00:12:56.824 --> 00:12:58.951
What kind of teacher
is Onizuka-sensei?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.593
Could you confirm the rumor
that he is involved with Mafia gangs?

00:13:02.663 --> 00:13:04.221
Aren't there unsettled feelings
among students?

00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:06.128
How is the school
going to deal with this?

00:13:08.035 --> 00:13:12.995
Look at that media crowd!
What has Onizuka done?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.541
This is why we should have
fired him immediately!

00:13:17.011 --> 00:13:18.569
What are we going to do,
Principal?!

00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:20.944
TEACHER HAS
YAKUZA CONNECTION

00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:22.380
Calm down, Vice Principal.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.609
How can I calm down?

00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:28.482
It's the wildest scandal
in the history of our school!

00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:31.983
Even I can't believe that
Onizuka-sensei was involved...

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:34.323
...in Enjo Kosai
and drug dealing.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:37.053
It's hard to believe
he would sink so low...

00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:38.528
Oh, my God!

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.157
That's not true.

00:13:40.835 --> 00:13:42.700
But they said so
on the morning TV news...

00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:45.504
But the police have not released
any information...

00:13:45.606 --> 00:13:47.665
...on the cause of the case!

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:48.976
Besides...

00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:53.309
...Onizuka-sensei is in the middle
of fighting for his life.

00:13:53.514 --> 00:13:54.640
You guys are too cruel!

00:13:55.483 --> 00:14:00.113
Anyway, it is a big problem
for our school!

00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:09.159
Huh? Ah, is that...
Could they be...?

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:15.231
Assemblyman Ohta and Ohta-san,
the representative...

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:17.964
...of "The Society of the Study
of Victimization in Education."

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:21.873
Hee! Those two have come
to our school!

00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:25.673
Hee! It's all over!
Our school will be shut down!

00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:29.042
If I lose my job...

00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:31.785
Now, fighting with our back
against the wall, Principal...

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:33.217
...please leave it to me.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.414
Oh, I wouldn't be able to assume
the role of Vice Principal...

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.118
...if I couldn't take on
a mere assemblyman or two.

00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:43.060
I will take him on...
fair and square!

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.838
Please let me beg
for your forgiveness!

00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:53.997
A part-time teacher here
did something so scandalous...

00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:56.041
...to disturb the public peace.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.544
I apologize...
sincerely... Please!

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:01.680
Principal, where is Onizuka-sensei?

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:03.141
Um...that's...

00:15:03.484 --> 00:15:05.748
Speaking of that man...

00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:08.788
...to tell you the truth,
we fired him as of yesterday.

00:15:08.923 --> 00:15:10.686
Therefore, sorry to say...

00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:13.955
...our school has nothing
to do with him...technically...

00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:15.221
Vice Principal!

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:16.593
Would you be quiet?

00:15:17.164 --> 00:15:18.188
Principal!

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:19.633
Hee!

00:15:21.435 --> 00:15:23.995
Hee! It's all over!

00:15:27.074 --> 00:15:29.133
Principal! We were touched.

00:15:29.443 --> 00:15:31.673
He is truly dedicated!

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:33.110
What?

00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:35.114
Our daughter told us
what happened.

00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:40.745
An unforgivable fellow kidnapped
my daughter in order to blackmail me...

00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:44.587
... regarding the public construction
bidding I'm in charge of.

00:15:44.658 --> 00:15:46.888
Onizuka-sensei rescued Hidemi...

00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:52.092
...risking the exam he was
about to take and even his own life!

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:55.268
Please tell Onizuka-sensei that...

00:15:55.336 --> 00:15:58.305
...I am grateful to him
from the bottom of my heart...

00:15:58.472 --> 00:16:02.272
...and apologize for my wife's
past rude behavior.

00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:06.937
Please reverse the decision
to fire Onizuka-sensei.

00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:08.344
I beg of you.

00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:13.243
But we can't really ignore
the result of the national exam.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.448
I'm pretty positive that
he didn't score too well...

00:16:18.626 --> 00:16:19.718
The results are in!

00:16:19.794 --> 00:16:21.284
The breaking news on the results
of the national exam...

00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:22.386
... have just been released!

00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:24.662
How did Onizuka-sensei do?

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:27.229
Um...it's...

00:16:33.307 --> 00:16:34.774
#3 SUGURU TESHIGAWARA

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.972
#2 YOSHITO KIKUCHI

00:16:39.847 --> 00:16:42.372
#1 EIKICHI ONIZUKA

00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:45.808
Perfect score?

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:48.320
You mean...
that good-for-nothing bastard?

00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:49.888
Principal!

00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:54.893
EIKICHI ONIZUKA
NO VISITORS ALLOWED

00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:56.585
Onizuka-san...?

00:16:58.866 --> 00:17:03.369
KICHIJOJI HOSPITAL
Doctor! Onizuka-san escaped!

00:17:03.537 --> 00:17:05.061
GYOZA MISO RAMEN SHIO RAMEN

00:17:05.206 --> 00:17:07.970
According to police, teacher was
the prime suspect in the criminal case...

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:10.636
...in which over a dozen were injured.
However, it appears he was the one...

00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:12.474
... who rescued the daughter of
an assemblyman who was targeted...

00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:14.173
... for his involvement
in public construction bidding.

00:17:14.248 --> 00:17:15.916
During the incident, teacher
was shot three times...

00:17:15.916 --> 00:17:16.883
... and was critically injured.

00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:19.215
He has been in the hospital
fighting for his life...

00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:20.253
Hey, old man!

00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:21.288
RAMEN KING
CHINESE NOODLES

00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:22.912
Give me another bowl of rice
with an extra scoop on top.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.514
And add liver and gyoza!

00:17:26.727 --> 00:17:28.695
It was you, Kikuchi, wasn't it?

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.921
I certainly prepared
two answer sheets...

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:34.360
...and switched one
with Onizuka's sheet...

00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:35.663
...when I was collecting them.

00:17:36.503 --> 00:17:38.562
But...to tell you the truth...
it's a little strange...

00:17:38.772 --> 00:17:39.796
What?

00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:44.773
His answer sheet had one extra
correct answer with two points.

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:50.806
Since my total score was 492,
his total should have been 494.

00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:53.314
But he got a perfect score.

00:17:53.988 --> 00:17:55.285
What does that mean?

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.753
It means there are people
other than us...

00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:01.458
...who want him
to remain a teacher.

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:03.857
It was your doing,
wasn't it?

00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:06.692
You even made an arrangement...

00:18:06.867 --> 00:18:08.698
...with the board to let
that man score perfectly.

00:18:09.303 --> 00:18:11.328
What a dishonest act!

00:18:12.506 --> 00:18:16.101
No matter how much I'm criticized,
I won't regret it.

00:18:16.477 --> 00:18:20.106
That's how much
this school needs him.

00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:23.314
We need a teacher
like him desperately...

00:18:23.951 --> 00:18:25.816
CONGRATULATIONS
#1 IN JAPAN

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.388
Hurray, Onizuka. Cool!
Awesome!

00:18:28.522 --> 00:18:30.649
Well, well, well...

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:34.516
Though I got a perfect score
and finished at the top nationally...

00:18:34.728 --> 00:18:36.958
...the exam was
no more than junior high level.

00:18:37.598 --> 00:18:39.532
I would say...if a teacher
didn't score perfectly...

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.865
...THAT would be a shame!
Ha ha ha...

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.837
Why...why...why...why?

00:18:47.675 --> 00:18:50.041
Teshigawara-sensei!

00:18:52.413 --> 00:18:54.210
Ah, there you are!

00:18:55.983 --> 00:18:58.451
Huh...you live
in a place like this?

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:00.682
Oh, it's you.

00:19:00.854 --> 00:19:02.185
Hey, that's rude!

00:19:08.128 --> 00:19:10.528
I wish I could go back
and be a junior high student...

00:19:10.764 --> 00:19:13.665
...and be in Class 3-4
in this school...

00:19:16.203 --> 00:19:18.831
Huh? What about Class 3-4?

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.431
Um...nothing!

00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:24.809
If you don't have anything specific
to say, hurry up and go home.

00:19:24.878 --> 00:19:26.903
Your dad and mom
must be worried.

00:19:27.047 --> 00:19:29.106
You don't need to tell me
to go home!

00:19:29.483 --> 00:19:32.111
I can't stay in such
a filthy place too long!

00:19:36.857 --> 00:19:39.485
What the hell
is that girl thinking?

00:19:44.298 --> 00:19:46.425
Onizuka...Eikichi...

00:20:03.117 --> 00:20:06.086
I wonder
what his real score was.

00:20:07.154 --> 00:20:08.917
JUSTICE

00:20:16.497 --> 00:20:18.124
This is...

00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:22.728
Onizuka!

00:20:23.103 --> 00:20:25.901
Kikuchi! Come to school
for a little while!

00:20:25.973 --> 00:20:27.941
The most terrible
thing happened!

00:20:31.612 --> 00:20:33.773
What's the most
terrible thing?

00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:36.606
I wanted to see some girls
on the Internet...

00:20:36.683 --> 00:20:38.207
... but the computer broke.

00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:42.516
You're the only one who can fix it.
So, please!

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:46.355
I led such a stoic life
at Fuyutsuki-sensei's for a week!

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.361
So I'm starving
for that kind of stuff.

00:20:51.965 --> 00:20:53.057
Hey, teacher!

00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:54.293
Huh?

00:20:54.535 --> 00:20:56.435
About the national exam...

00:20:57.171 --> 00:20:59.537
...what did you think your score
would be realistically?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.035
Huh? It was obvious!

00:21:02.109 --> 00:21:03.098
What?

00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:05.405
Perfect score!

00:21:07.681 --> 00:21:10.650
Indeed...what an admirable
guy you are!

00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.144
What?
Did you say something?

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.818
Why are you
in your underwear?

00:21:16.223 --> 00:21:19.021
I'm doing laundry after letting
it pile up for a long time.

00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:22.358
So I have nothing else to wear.
It's better than being naked!

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:45.541
You and me, let's go away

00:21:45.747 --> 00:21:50.810
To look for new emotions today

00:21:50.953 --> 00:21:55.822
Together we can overcome

00:21:56.058 --> 00:22:01.758
Because I want to enjoy
A new tomorrow

00:22:01.997 --> 00:22:06.161
Open your eyes and open the door

00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:11.372
The world in front of your eyes

00:22:12.141 --> 00:22:16.976
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:22:17.346 --> 00:22:21.578
I will taste
my childhood emotions

00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:32.386
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:22:32.961 --> 00:22:42.393
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:46.803
I want to see you, but I can't

00:22:47.042 --> 00:22:51.877
So I just embrace my love

00:22:52.147 --> 00:22:56.982
Even walking on a crowded street

00:22:57.219 --> 00:23:03.624
Your smile makes my head spin

00:23:14.203 --> 00:23:16.694
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:16.905 --> 00:23:18.338
Yoo-hoo!

00:23:18.473 --> 00:23:19.440
Kanzaki!

00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:21.008
It's obvious.

00:23:21.143 --> 00:23:22.508
Whoa!

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:25.745
What are you plotting?

00:23:26.582 --> 00:23:29.142
It looks like I'll be able
to kill some time soon.
