WEBVTT

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:11.449
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.573
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.799
This street makes me love

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:27.568
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:32.707
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:38.046
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:43.357
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.925
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:54.567
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.404 --> 00:01:00.774
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.141
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:11.309
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:19.189
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:22.761
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:26.562
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.851
All the street racers respected her.
She was like a queen.

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.287
In the wild "Last Signal" race,
where traffic lights went ignored...

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:48.549
...she never lost,
and her fame became legendary...

00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:49.783
...as the "Queen of Hakosuka."

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:53.759
That's Nao Kadena.
No doubt about it.

00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:57.088
Queen of Hakosuka.

00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:05.165
The 30 million yen
which was promised...

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:07.566
...I have deposited
in your account.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:11.443
So is the preparation
for the operation proceeding?

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:14.948
SCHOOL INFIRMARY
Yes, as soon as the schedule
for the operation is set...

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.411
... I'm going to tell my brother
about this.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.155
I'll wait for your call.
Thank you.

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.397
KICHIJOJI STATION

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:45.039
This is what I bought
from Kadena-kun.

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:48.341
It's the technologically-advanced
"Miracle Scope"...

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.510
...developed by NASA
to search for planets.

00:02:51.953 --> 00:02:55.184
It's supposed to see
through any material.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.485
So if I use this...

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:00.590
This becomes this...

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.663
...then this...

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.231
Our technology
sure has advanced with time.

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:12.469
This is for me to keep up
with the new technology.

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.472
Switch... On!

00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:16.867
What? This way?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.846
What's this?
Strange!

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.780
I can't see through anything.

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:25.182
This cost me 200,000 yen!
What's going on?!

00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:26.754
Return my money!

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:28.917
Return my money!

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:31.152
What's this?
Weird.

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:37.568
What did you say?
No returns?

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:39.491
Don't joke with me.

00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:43.306
It isn't reasonable that the damaged
merchandise cost 200,000 yen.

00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:45.733
What does this mean,
Kadena-kun?

00:03:46.028 --> 00:03:48.552
To call it damaged merchandise
is a false allegation.

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:49.755
But you...

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:53.428
Oh, don't tell me you had
a nasty plan...

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:59.126
...to see under women's
clothes with this device.

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.633
Why would I think like that?

00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:07.066
That's what I thought.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.206
There is no way that Vice Principal,
the model educator...

00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:13.307
...would have a dirty thought
like that.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.843
I didn't say you could do it, either.

00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:21.071
Wait a minute, Kadena-kun.

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:22.974
Anything else?

00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:28.476
I'm hearing rumors about you.
You seem to have many problems.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.884
You gather students in the infirmary,
students who are skipping classes.

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:35.350
You work as a hostess at night.

00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:37.942
Don't you know the school
prohibits our teachers...

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:40.044
...from having another job?

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:46.591
I'm going to report this
to the principal. Be prepared!

00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:47.988
Do whatever you like.

00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:51.491
Do whatever I like?

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:53.717
What's with that attitude?!

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:57.819
All of those young teachers...!
Like trash teacher, Onizuka...!

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.732
It's strange.
I can't see through it.

00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:06.648
Onizuka-sensei?

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.068
Oh, that is...!

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:12.201
Fuyutsuki-sensei!
What's up?!

00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:14.430
Nice weather, isn't it?

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.433
Teacher!

00:05:16.673 --> 00:05:18.537
Teacher, bad news!

00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.802
The Vice Principal wants
to fire Nao-chan.

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:24.100
Leave him alone.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.371
He always tells me that.
But nothing happens.

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:29.341
It's different in this case.

00:05:29.546 --> 00:05:30.978
Do you know anything,
Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.041
I'm not sure...

00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:35.577
- Let's go and see.
- Yeah.

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:39.213
SCHOOL INFIRMARY
Are you sure you want
to quit school?

00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.917
What can I do?
The Vice Principal seems serious.

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.286
He'll talk to the principal.

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:49.613
Anyway,
I have enough money now.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.355
RESIGNATION
I knew this would happen
sooner or later. So I'm prepared.

00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:58.856
We'll do whatever we can.
You don't need to quit!

00:05:59.194 --> 00:06:02.458
That's right.
We're getting along well now.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.325
Thank you!
I'll be your friend always.

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:08.757
But...

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:11.555
Murai. I don't think
you can change her mind.

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:16.133
This was her plan all along.

00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:19.626
She would quit school
right after she got enough money.

00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:22.089
Is it wrong?

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.057
No. It's your choice.

00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:28.225
Don't quit, Nao-chan.

00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.500
Well, it sounds bad because
you say "quitting" and "firing."

00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:37.077
Nao-chan has reached her goal,
and she's leaving this school.

00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:39.678
We can call it "graduation."

00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:45.049
Let's give her a nice farewell.
Right, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:06:45.587 --> 00:06:46.986
I don't know!

00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:50.046
What are you angry at?
Fuyutsuki-chan?

00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:51.125
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:06:53.524 --> 00:06:57.285
Fuyutsuki-sensei,
do you think it's our fault?

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:00.595
We are skipping classes
and staying in the infirmary.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:02.759
Not only that...

00:07:03.538 --> 00:07:06.669
But we weren't just
playing around in there.

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:10.948
We were getting advice
about our homes and the future.

00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:15.453
Me, too. My mother is young,
and I don't know what will happen.

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.554
Girls were also telling her things...

00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.965
...they couldn't talk about
with anyone else.

00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:22.071
Is that so?

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:26.243
She doesn't look like it,
but Nao-chan has had a hard life.

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:28.748
She needs money
for someone in her family...

00:07:28.853 --> 00:07:30.686
...who was injured in an accident.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.757
What?

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.698
NERIMA DAIICHI MOTORS
Don't you specialize
in motorcycles?

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:36.324
Don't you specialize
in motorcycles?

00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:40.596
In the future we would like
to expand to used cars.

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:43.746
GARAGE R MANAGER RYUJIDANMA
That's why I would like
to ask for your advice.

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:48.210
Our business is gloomy, too.
I'll think about it.

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:49.552
Thank you!

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:52.354
I envy Eikichi.

00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:55.668
Teachers don't need to lower
themselves in order to make sales.

00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:57.136
Aren't you Danma-san?

00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:01.681
I'm Muto. I used to be head
of the Nerima Massacre Group.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.585
Remember? We challenged Shonan
and were beaten by Onibaku.

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.125
That's you.
It's been a while.

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:13.696
Takashi, this is Ryuji Danma,
a partner of the legendary Onibaku.

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:18.539
Hello. I'm Takashi Kadena.
I've heard about you from Muto.

00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:19.942
Kadena?

00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:23.313
He was a street racer in Yokohama.

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:27.428
But he was a mechanic,
and his sister was more famous.

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:29.693
That's enough.

00:08:30.403 --> 00:08:33.135
He doesn't like to talk
about the past.

00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:36.411
But he was the best mechanic.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.539
Of course.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:40.447
A little praise
makes you too snobby.

00:08:41.257 --> 00:08:43.250
Hey, are you...?

00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:45.831
- What?
- What's up, Danma-san?

00:08:50.674 --> 00:08:53.475
Onizuka-sensei, your cell phone...

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.956
Onizuka-sensei is away
from his desk now.

00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:01.087
Oh, Danma...!

00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:04.121
What? Kadena-sensei's brother?

00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:08.233
Hey! Can't you get down?!

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:12.442
You're not doing it right at all!

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:14.712
Everyone needs
one-on-one lessons!

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:19.422
Only the body is growing up...

00:09:27.912 --> 00:09:29.471
It really hit him...

00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:32.345
Good job. Soldier Anne.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.626
Wonderful!
Did you see it hit him?!

00:09:35.727 --> 00:09:37.662
The next one is ready!

00:09:38.398 --> 00:09:41.598
Onizuka...
He's disturbing my class again.

00:09:41.704 --> 00:09:44.300
I won't allow him to do it today!

00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:46.747
TERRESTRIAL DEFENSE FORCE
Attention,
Terrestrial Defense Force!

00:09:46.747 --> 00:09:49.486
TERRESTRIAL DEFENSE FORCE
Destroy Pervert Monster
Hokuroder!

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.045
Yes!

00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:54.652
There isn't any reason
for you to call me a pervert!

00:09:56.499 --> 00:09:58.594
Yeah! Go, go!

00:10:06.853 --> 00:10:08.343
We did it!

00:10:08.823 --> 00:10:10.154
Kadena-sensei...

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.049
What's up, Fuyutsuki-chan?

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.587
I acted like I was better than you,
without really knowing you...

00:10:21.124 --> 00:10:23.524
Forget about it, join us instead!

00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:28.228
This is fun, Fuyutsuki-chan.
It's pretty good.

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:33.865
Nao-chan.
Our object is gone.

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.906
We're just starting to have fun!
Hokuroda! You chicken!

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:41.806
Nao-chan. You're aggressive!

00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.538
Hokuroda was crying.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.042
We still have this much!

00:10:49.018 --> 00:10:53.045
I wanted to stay at this fun school
a little bit longer.

00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:55.818
Well, it's too late, I guess.

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:01.327
I'm surrounded
by beautiful women...

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.898
...and having free Sukiyaki!

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:08.460
I guess this is heaven!

00:11:10.873 --> 00:11:14.206
No one said it's free.

00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:20.610
We're having the best beef.
It would cost a lot, wouldn't it?

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:27.621
Yes, Sukiyaki and the service fees.
The total will be 125,000 yen.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.924
Payday is coming up,
so Onizuka-sensei can pay.

00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:34.992
Then I want him to pay everything
when he gets paid.

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:36.754
No way...!

00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:38.794
Just kidding.

00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:40.897
What a dirty trick!

00:11:41.003 --> 00:11:44.268
They've ganged up to put me down
behind my back.

00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:47.872
Let's have a party tonight.

00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:51.140
We'll celebrate my graduation
and save the 30 million yen!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.108
Thirty million yen?!
What's that for?

00:11:56.018 --> 00:11:58.179
A member of my family
was in an accident.

00:11:58.287 --> 00:12:00.653
I was told
that it would cost that much...

00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:02.917
...for the surgery in the U.S.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.026
There are many foreign objects
in his body.

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:09.597
We don't know when those objects
will reach the heart.

00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:12.363
But I have already paid in full.

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:14.993
Now I'm just waiting for a call
from the person...

00:12:15.104 --> 00:12:17.334
...who arranged all of this.

00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:20.472
It's been a long time.
It was three years ago.

00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:24.871
Good evening. News time.

00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:27.242
A con man is wanted by the police.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.978
He's told victims he can arrange
for famous doctors...

00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:30.152
MEDICAL AGENT FRAUD

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:32.788
MEDICAL AGENT FRAUD
...to perform operations abroad.

00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:36.192
MEDICAL AGENT FRAUD
He scammed quite a bit of money
from his victims and then ran off..

00:12:36.192 --> 00:12:36.214
MEDICAL AGENT FRAUD

00:12:36.325 --> 00:12:37.792
The con man...

00:12:37.894 --> 00:12:39.794
Is this...? Kadena-sensei?

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:41.523
What are you talking about?

00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:44.822
This can't be true. No way.

00:12:49.077 --> 00:12:50.586
TONIGHT'S DINNER
IS SUKIYAKI

00:12:54.318 --> 00:12:56.479
Street racer?
How did you know?

00:12:57.287 --> 00:12:59.152
Even Murai and the others
don't know that.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.818
Onizuka-sensei's friend
saw you back then.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.527
At that time,
racing was my life.

00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:14.033
I was called
the Queen of Hakosuka.

00:13:14.137 --> 00:13:16.298
I was famous among the group.

00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:19.571
But one day you caused
an accident and lost a race...

00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:21.041
...then left the group.

00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.835
You knew that, too.

00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:27.543
The unexpected loss by
the Queen of Hakosuka is...

00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:30.118
...still a mystery
among the group.

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:36.783
I'm wondering if the driver
in your car wasn't you...

00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:38.918
...but someone else.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.099
Maybe it's the person who needs
that operation in the U.S.

00:13:44.534 --> 00:13:47.230
Takashi Kadena,
my little brother.

00:13:48.271 --> 00:13:51.206
Takashi liked being a mechanic
more than racing.

00:13:51.308 --> 00:13:55.642
He was driving my Hakosuka
without telling me...

00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:59.739
...and was challenged by someone
who thought I was the driver.

00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:05.016
He couldn't decline, and he raced
"Last Signal" for the first time.

00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:34.345
It's a miracle that he survived
and recovered.

00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.942
But there is still
a problem with his eyes.

00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:38.851
That's a major obstacle...

00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:41.719
...when it comes to being
a top-notch mechanic.

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.054
So he disappeared from my life.

00:14:46.563 --> 00:14:51.159
I was just too caught up in being
called the Queen of Hakosuka.

00:14:51.268 --> 00:14:53.168
It is, after all, my fault...

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.433
...for getting him involved,
and then taking his dream away.

00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:00.108
I heard that
he'd completely recover...

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.735
...if he has surgery in the U.S.

00:15:02.846 --> 00:15:06.543
Since then I concentrated
on making money.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.984
But when I thought I finally
had enough, it ends like this.

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.419
It's strange, isn't it?

00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:17.491
Sorry.
It's a gloomy story.

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:20.289
Kadena-sensei...

00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:25.424
You and I had different opinions,
but it was fun. Thank you.

00:15:26.336 --> 00:15:28.065
What are you going to do now?

00:15:28.572 --> 00:15:31.200
Well, I don't have any money now.

00:15:31.374 --> 00:15:34.810
I feel like I just lost everything
that kept me going.

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:38.106
I don't know what to do.

00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:45.020
Don't worry. I'll survive.
See you.

00:15:45.255 --> 00:15:47.655
Can you say that
you're really living your life?

00:15:52.596 --> 00:15:57.590
Leave your brother alone.
Live your life!

00:15:59.169 --> 00:16:03.833
You're all outsiders.
No one understands how I feel.

00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:10.779
I don't understand. I don't want
to understand how you feel.

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:20.820
What are you doing?

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.517
Let's get the thing back...

00:16:23.627 --> 00:16:26.425
...the one thing that's
more important to you than money.

00:16:31.735 --> 00:16:35.535
What are you thinking?
You brought us all the way here.

00:16:42.712 --> 00:16:43.974
Thank you for waiting.

00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:45.281
Hey, Ryuji.

00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:58.418
Your order, one Hakosuka.
Here it is.

00:16:59.362 --> 00:17:03.492
It's aged a bit. But its performance
should be as good as it used to be.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.862
I can guarantee it.

00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:09.235
Let's start the "Last Signal."

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.430
What are you thinking?

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:17.169
Rather than thinking about the past,
isn't it better to die doing this?

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.605
You would feel better
if you went quickly.

00:17:20.217 --> 00:17:23.186
Or are you afraid,
Queen of Hakosuka?

00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:40.400
Let's start!

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:45.174
This has nothing to do with me.
You really could die.

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:10.789
That's the way!

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.334
Can you say
you're living your life?

00:18:46.937 --> 00:18:47.995
Idiot...

00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:53.074
Stop!!

00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:02.376
Whew, it's a tie.

00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:04.686
When I was in Yokohama...

00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:07.313
... I heard rumors
about Onibaku in Shonan.

00:19:07.557 --> 00:19:09.115
You lived up to the rumor.

00:19:10.193 --> 00:19:11.160
You, too.

00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:19.826
You're both alive.

00:19:25.709 --> 00:19:26.801
Takashi...

00:19:27.978 --> 00:19:30.310
Your brother built that Hakosuka.

00:19:30.413 --> 00:19:33.382
He asked us to get you back...
the way you used to be.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.018
Sorry that I didn't contact you
for so long...

00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:39.083
...but I wanted to escape from you.

00:19:41.324 --> 00:19:43.485
I liked when you drove Hakosuka.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.187
I don't want to see you
wasting your life for me.

00:19:47.797 --> 00:19:49.287
That accident was my fault.

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:50.861
Takashi...

00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:55.595
...you have an unpredictable
problem with your body.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:20:00.539
Don't worry. I'll make money
by myself and have an operation.

00:20:00.643 --> 00:20:02.543
You live your own life.

00:20:05.215 --> 00:20:07.615
I'm not giving up.

00:20:07.717 --> 00:20:09.912
I'm still chasing my dream.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.719
Someday, I'll be someone
you can be proud of.

00:20:14.824 --> 00:20:15.882
Definitely!

00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:20.254
I'm stupid.
Without knowing how you felt...

00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:23.161
...I thought I was carrying
the burden all by myself.

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:24.391
Really stupid...

00:20:25.802 --> 00:20:27.030
Sis...

00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:34.609
What's going on, everyone?
Why are you hurrying?

00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:36.139
Nao-chan...

00:20:36.246 --> 00:20:38.806
Sounds like Nao-chan
doesn't need to leave the school...!

00:20:39.282 --> 00:20:40.442
Really?

00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:44.045
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

00:20:49.092 --> 00:20:50.184
Vice Principal?!

00:20:50.393 --> 00:20:52.361
Good morning, everyone.

00:20:53.997 --> 00:20:55.589
Vice Principal.

00:20:55.698 --> 00:20:58.223
Is it true that Kadena-sensei
doesn't have to leave school?

00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:00.798
Well, there were many problems.

00:21:00.904 --> 00:21:03.566
I think we need
a passionate teacher...

00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:06.301
... like Kadena-kun in our school.

00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:09.344
I've decided not to report it
to the principal.

00:21:09.612 --> 00:21:12.877
As I thought about it, education
comes from passion. Passion!

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:23.925
Well, then, I'm leaving now...

00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:31.366
RESIGNATION

00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:52.618
You can't love everyone

00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:55.849
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.092 --> 00:21:59.994
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.163 --> 00:22:05.396
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:09.964
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.176
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.444 --> 00:22:22.317
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:22.586 --> 00:22:27.114
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:28.858 --> 00:22:32.385
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:32.629 --> 00:22:36.622
What is there for me to do?

00:22:36.866 --> 00:22:40.666
It may be small now

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.829
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:48.670
A tear is about to drop

00:22:49.012 --> 00:22:52.948
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:56.811
Live strong every moment

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:02.959
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:19.201
NEXT EPISODE
Okay, then. I'm going to eat
all their staff's lunches.

00:23:19.276 --> 00:23:19.401
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:19.476 --> 00:23:21.945
NEXT EPISODE
I was hungry.

00:23:21.945 --> 00:23:23.606
Please eat with me!

00:23:24.147 --> 00:23:26.513
To make her popular,
we need commercials.

00:23:27.751 --> 00:23:29.412
Mellow melon!

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.920
Although we're amateurs, we know
Toroko's charm better than you.

00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:38.724
Interesting. If you say so,
I want you to do it.

00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:44.657
I finally got Toroko some work!
Don't interfere.

00:23:44.968 --> 00:23:46.333
It's thick and hard.

00:23:46.503 --> 00:23:54.376
SEE YA NEXT TIME
