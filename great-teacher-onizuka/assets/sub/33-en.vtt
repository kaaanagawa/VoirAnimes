Thanks for your work
at the Uniform Pub!

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.582
That's right. I think
that we totally ruined Onizuka!

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.122
What? A party?

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:55.624
Yes. A party to celebrate
Onizuka getting fired.

00:01:56.598 --> 00:01:58.566
I'm thinking about
reserving a suite at a hotel...

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.657
...and celebrating
with an extravaganza!

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:03.262
Really?! Are you serious? I'm in!

00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:05.696
And where is this happening?

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.309
Yeah, I know...

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:10.869
Seven o'clock tonight?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.439
Okay, okay! I'll be there!

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:17.312
Hey, you guys!

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.348
Listen! Yoko said...

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.918
That's what you wanted, right?

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.719
Very good. Very good.
Thank you, Yoko.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:29.695
What are you
going to do to Miyabi?

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:34.100
Hold on. You'd better
not ask any questions.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.931
Do you want me to tell your
parents about the Uniform Pub?

00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:54.747
Don't worry.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.724
The deadline is two days away.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.217
The Mercedes Benz
will be back by then.

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.723
But if it isn't...

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:06.162
Oops, I have to go to work.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.205
I'll make my afternoon
class a study period.

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:16.375
Could you check on them
from time to time?

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:20.314
Who knows what they could
be up to if we're not watching.

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:22.383
See you later.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:24.618
Onizuka...

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:28.317
I guess he tends
to trust others too easily.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.957
You're right.

00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:33.388
The possibility of getting
the Mercedes back is almost zero.

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:35.857
Are you going to wait anyway?

00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:38.595
Yes. A deadline is a deadline.

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:46.970
What's going on?
You called us up here.

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:52.336
I wanted to tell you
something interesting.

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:55.543
This is so outrageous...

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:57.910
...that I called only
those of you with real guts.

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:00.220
Here it is.

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:04.091
Miyabi...

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.424
It's a plan to punish you.

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.397
You need to pay
for what you did.

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:13.866
This is what the ignorant
little princess deserves!

00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:16.163
Kanzaki, what did you do?

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:18.372
Kanzaki!

00:04:19.307 --> 00:04:20.296
Well see...

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:22.568
Here! This is it!

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:24.442
Suite No. 2801!

00:04:25.013 --> 00:04:28.244
Wow! This is the penthouse!

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:30.343
All right! Let's get ready!

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:38.383
Congratulations
on Onizuka's retirement!

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:43.288
It's dark. Maybe
no one has arrived yet.

00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:45.395
But it's 7:00 now.

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:48.927
What's this?!

00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:50.129
Don't mess with us!

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.568
Lights! Quick!

00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:04.175
So you gave him
the Mercedes Benz?

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.617
Well, it's called an act of mercy.

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:09.455
You're stupid.

00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:13.926
It's a typical game
run by a petty con-artist.

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:16.023
That's what everyone told me.

00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:19.057
Even if his story is true...

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.333
...if the student he cosigned for
does not return the money...

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:23.663
...then it's all over.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:25.864
That may be true.

00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:30.802
But I wanted to believe in him...

00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:35.312
...because the fact that the student
asked for help means...

00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:38.585
...that he thought that his teacher
could help him.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.016
I admire that kind of teacher...

00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:45.621
...a teacher who is
trusted by his students.

00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:49.830
I don't know if I should call
you optimistic or idiotic.

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:53.727
What are you looking at?

00:05:53.835 --> 00:05:56.133
You don't need to see this.
Keep cleaning the windows.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.396
That's not fair!

00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:00.471
- Let me have them.
- No, let go!

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:03.476
Look out! We're going to fall!

00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.445
Kanzaki! What did you set up?!

00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:11.012
I want Miyabi and her friends
to come up with the 8 million yen.

00:06:12.453 --> 00:06:13.647
20 million yen each.

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.486
I think their parents
can pay a ransom.

00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:19.582
You mean...?!

00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:20.794
You've gone too far!

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:23.430
Really?

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:28.958
Are you serious?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.569
It's no use trying to hide.

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:36.236
Open up!

00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:38.036
What's going on?

00:06:38.813 --> 00:06:39.973
I don't know!

00:07:03.037 --> 00:07:04.004
Miyabi!

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:14.181
Hello.

00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:15.449
Hello!

00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:16.750
Urumi!

00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.318
How's your party? Having fun?

00:07:18.686 --> 00:07:22.053
You set us up!
What are you going to do?!

00:07:22.657 --> 00:07:26.821
20 million yen from each of you,
which comes to 60 million yen.

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:32.731
Out of that, well take 8 million yen
to cover Onizuka's debt.

00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.892
It's called ransom.

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:40.299
This is just the natural
outcome of what you started.

00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:43.010
Do you know
what you're talking about?!

00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:44.269
I'm going to call the police!

00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:47.246
If you do, I'll tell them everything...

00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:50.408
...including the money
you embezzled.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:54.419
That's if you can
make it out alive!

00:07:56.057 --> 00:07:59.549
I told you if you made
me angry, you would regret it.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:01.752
Miyabi...

00:08:01.996 --> 00:08:03.463
Go to hell!

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:08.226
Hey, where is it? Which room?!

00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:10.466
I told you I didn't see anything.

00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:14.707
You're lying! You said, "Oh!"

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:24.079
No!

00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:26.119
Do you want to listen?

00:08:26.454 --> 00:08:29.082
Hey, even though they're bad,
they are our classmates!

00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:31.257
What are you talking about?

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:35.428
We can get 8 million
and punish Miyabi and her friends.

00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:37.460
It's like killing
two birds with one stone.

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:38.532
Get real!

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:39.927
I'm out of here!

00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:42.057
Kikuchi!

00:08:42.403 --> 00:08:44.667
Get your hands off of me!

00:08:47.942 --> 00:08:48.909
I said get your hands off of me!

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.342
I'm telling you!
Let me go, damn you!

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:54.813
Stop it!
What are you doing?! Let me go!

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.517
What are you going to do?!
Get away from us!

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:00.380
No! Don't come any closer!

00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:01.889
Shut up!

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:14.258
Hello! Eikichi Onizuka.
22 years old.

00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:17.031
Oh, Kikuchi...

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:22.572
Miyabi Aizawa, Chikako Shirai,
Saeko lijima. Right?

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:31.218
Answer me!

00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:36.180
That's it!

00:09:39.493 --> 00:09:41.757
You're there?!
What good timing!

00:09:42.463 --> 00:09:43.589
Anyway, we don't have time!

00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:45.359
I'll let you deal with it,
teacher!

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:46.600
All right.

00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:00.736
TO BI MA SU TO BI MA SU
(I'LL FLY, I'LL FLY)

00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:03.348
Hey, Teacher..!

00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:05.559
What?!

00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:09.753
Are the address
and phone number correct?

00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:11.898
Yes.

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:13.123
All right. Make the call.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.267
Yeah...

00:10:16.737 --> 00:10:18.432
Help! Someone!

00:10:19.173 --> 00:10:20.504
Dad... Mom...

00:10:21.742 --> 00:10:22.800
Police officer...

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:24.411
Teacher...

00:10:25.413 --> 00:10:26.380
Please...

00:10:26.547 --> 00:10:27.741
I was wrong.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.475
Please help me.

00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:34.819
Hello. The Aizawa residence.

00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:38.091
Hello?

00:10:39.427 --> 00:10:40.519
What's that?!

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:47.300
Onizuka!

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:16.024
Hey! Get up!

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:18.421
You came to help us, didn't you?!

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:20.966
Then help us quickly! Hey!

00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:22.361
Quick!

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:29.099
Who is he?!

00:11:33.013 --> 00:11:35.106
Quickly! Beat them up!

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:43.421
What are you talking about?

00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:53.797
I just came to watch...

00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:56.377
...as a social science teacher.

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:58.777
What do you mean?!

00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:00.840
Don't act innocent.

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:08.019
You set me up.

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:12.993
The Uniform Pub
deceived me completely.

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:23.803
Why should I
help such a big liar?

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:28.046
You're our homeroom
teacher, aren't you?!

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.514
Helping students
is a teacher's job!

00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:32.045
Are you stupid?

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.956
If it's just a job, our work is over
when the bell rings at 5:30. Idiot!

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:39.091
Usually you look down
on your teachers...

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:40.921
...and show it in your attitude.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:44.121
But when you're in trouble,
you want a teacher to help you?

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.366
You underestimate teachers.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:58.106
What are you doing?!

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:00.705
I haven't finished my speech!

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:02.281
Get your hands off of me!

00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:08.514
Teacher!

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:11.349
I want you to calm down.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:15.754
Miyabi... You call me a teacher
only when you need something...

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.557
This teacher doesn't do things that
aren't in the Education Guidebook.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:21.859
You idiot!

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.764
If you want me to help you,
apologize.

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:29.133
Don't mess with me!

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.210
Why should I have to bow down
to a stupid teacher?!

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.604
Then suit yourself.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:36.679
Oh, shut up!

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.745
Now what are you
going to do, Miyabi?

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:41.148
Are you going
to apologize or not?!

00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:43.614
I told you to shut up!
Are you deaf?!

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:48.557
So you won't apologize, Miyabi?

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.520
Damn you!

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:56.065
Now what are you going to do?
Make up your mind!

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:00.597
Aizawa!

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:09.538
I'm...sorry...

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:11.618
You owe me one, then.

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:26.891
Damn it! Run!

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.535
Take that guy
on the floor with you!

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.515
It was you who
called Onizuka. Right?

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.820
Kanzaki, you feel
better now, don't you?

00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:49.258
Onizuka is stupid.

00:14:49.862 --> 00:14:51.887
Now the 8 million yen is gone.

00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:54.390
He has only two days.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:58.937
Here's some rice gruel.

00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:00.995
You said you felt like
you have no energy.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.637
Make sure you go
see the doctor later.

00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:05.807
I'll let the school know.

00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:10.138
Dad called this morning
from his business trip.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.015
He asked if you were all right.

00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:17.311
You're really the apple of his eye.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.882
Remember? When you were
in elementary school...

00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:21.391
...we went to Mt. Yatsugatake...

00:15:21.494 --> 00:15:23.291
It's just an alibi, isn't it?

00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:25.285
No more jokes!

00:15:25.998 --> 00:15:28.057
You know the truth, too!

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:29.393
It isn't a business trip!

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:32.967
He's on the trip
with that woman! Right?

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:36.371
Don't treat me like a fool!
Do you think I'm blind?!

00:15:37.576 --> 00:15:38.543
Miyabi-chan...

00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:41.571
I've had enough of acting
like we're a happy family!

00:15:44.684 --> 00:15:47.209
All adults are conceited liars!

00:15:47.653 --> 00:15:49.484
I don't owe you anything.

00:15:49.722 --> 00:15:51.849
Who wants to owe an adult?

00:15:54.527 --> 00:15:56.017
Only one day left.

00:15:56.662 --> 00:15:59.256
Miyabi returned 1,070,000 yen...

00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:01.862
...280,000 from Pachinko...

00:16:02.368 --> 00:16:04.495
...and the amount he got
from his part-time job is...

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.963
Don't start calculating!
I'm getting irritated.

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:08.965
No matter how you figure it,
it's way short!

00:16:10.776 --> 00:16:11.743
He...

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:13.671
...will be gone, then?

00:16:19.218 --> 00:16:20.276
Hey! It's been a while!

00:16:20.553 --> 00:16:21.520
Fujiyoshi!

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.713
All right! It's been a while!

00:16:23.823 --> 00:16:25.313
You had us worried!

00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:26.391
I have something.

00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:28.988
Can you give this to teacher?

00:16:29.495 --> 00:16:30.826
This is the amount that I took.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.791
I'm returning what
I'm responsible for.

00:16:34.467 --> 00:16:35.832
I caused a lot of trouble,...

00:16:36.068 --> 00:16:38.002
...but now we can go
on the school trip, right?

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.707
As a matter of fact...

00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:49.848
Don't joke with me!

00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:53.144
How could we let
Onizuka get fired?!

00:16:56.922 --> 00:17:00.255
It's pretty high
here on the roof of the school.

00:17:02.728 --> 00:17:04.025
Are you thinking about something?

00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:06.829
No, I'm just looking...

00:17:07.166 --> 00:17:09.100
...to check if I can see the ocean.

00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:10.225
It's impossible.

00:17:10.936 --> 00:17:12.904
You can't see
the ocean from here.

00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:15.500
But why?

00:17:15.674 --> 00:17:18.336
Even if I leave here
and get on a tuna boat...

00:17:18.644 --> 00:17:22.410
...I want to remember in which
direction this school is located.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.812
Principal, I'm handing
this to you now.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.254
Rather than staying here uncool...

00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:33.990
...as a teacher, I want to teach
them one last lesson...

00:17:34.093 --> 00:17:35.924
...about how to take responsibility.

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:39.024
You have a full day
before the deadline.

00:17:40.032 --> 00:17:42.694
Murai and the others
preached to me a lot.

00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:45.764
Life is not that easy.

00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:49.398
I still have faith in him, though.

00:17:49.508 --> 00:17:50.475
Is that so?

00:17:59.018 --> 00:18:00.349
Are you sure that it's true?

00:18:00.553 --> 00:18:01.884
Yes, it's true!

00:18:02.188 --> 00:18:05.419
Onizuka-sensei submitted
his resignation as of today...

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:06.889
...and has left this school!

00:18:07.026 --> 00:18:07.993
What?!

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.323
I heard he's getting
on a tuna boat or something.

00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:13.757
Is it true?!

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:18.028
Are you all right?

00:18:18.137 --> 00:18:21.300
Didn't you wreck the Vice
Principal's Cresta the other day?

00:18:21.974 --> 00:18:24.704
That's because I didn't know
about the emergency brake!

00:18:24.944 --> 00:18:26.411
I did manage driving by myself.

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:28.374
By the way, whose car is this?

00:18:29.014 --> 00:18:31.039
Don't worry about it!

00:18:31.317 --> 00:18:32.716
Just hold on!

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:42.351
Train! Let's go by train!

00:18:47.766 --> 00:18:48.733
Principal...

00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:50.527
There is no way.

00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:53.566
I've done everything I...

00:18:57.009 --> 00:18:58.772
May I see Onizuka-sensei?

00:19:00.379 --> 00:19:01.368
You are...?

00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:04.240
Let's find him fast!

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.040
He is somewhere in this port!

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.676
Everyone, let's spread out
and search for him!

00:19:11.357 --> 00:19:14.451
Why is Onizuka's
Mercedes Benz here?

00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:17.395
Thank you very much.

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:19.794
Hiramatsu-sensei asked
me to tell Onizuka-sensei...

00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:22.229
...that he was deeply
grateful to him.

00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:23.668
Is that right?

00:19:24.103 --> 00:19:26.970
Then you can arrange
to get enough money?

00:19:27.373 --> 00:19:29.603
Yes. I have made up my mind.

00:19:30.576 --> 00:19:33.773
I'm scheduled to be
on a tuna boat for a year.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.646
With the advance, I was able
to take care of my money problem.

00:19:38.918 --> 00:19:40.977
It took a lot of time
to make my decision...

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.084
...and I screwed
things up for everyone.

00:19:44.924 --> 00:19:47.085
I see. Good for you
on making up your mind!

00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:51.360
Fuyutsuki-sensei! Doesn't
Onizuka have a cell phone?

00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:53.965
I haven't been able
to get a connection!

00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:57.366
There's no way!
We can never find him!

00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:01.406
Hello.

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:04.242
Principal...

00:20:05.844 --> 00:20:08.278
No. I can't reach
Onizuka on his cell phone.

00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:11.874
What?! I see...

00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:14.881
The Mercedes Benz came back!

00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:16.388
All right!

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:21.493
Look! Over there!

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:25.955
Oh, no! If we don't stop him,
hell head to the Indian Ocean!

00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:27.799
Onizuka!

00:20:28.434 --> 00:20:32.268
Onizuka! Onizuka!

00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:38.843
It's like I can hear everyone's
voice saying good-bye.

00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:41.970
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:44.040
Good-bye!

00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:48.676
Onizuka!

00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:05.763
Oh, damn! Why?!

00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:08.262
Why did Onizuka...

00:21:08.874 --> 00:21:11.843
...leave without saying anything?!
It's not fair!

00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:16.771
He got on the boat.
Now hell be gone for a year!

00:21:16.882 --> 00:21:17.849
It's no big deal.

00:21:19.284 --> 00:21:20.376
What did you say?!

00:21:21.587 --> 00:21:22.554
Because that's...

00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:24.680
...a Tokyo Bay cruise boat.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.785
It'll be back in two hours.

00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:53.247

Don't be an idiot!

00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:24.330
Hurry up!

00:23:27.212 --> 00:23:29.407
My contract may be sold...

00:23:35.353 --> 00:23:36.320
Damn!

00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:37.788
Let's go, Toroko!

00:23:42.794 --> 00:23:43.761
Onizuka-sensei!

00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:46.723
Don't be foolish.
I haven't given up yet.

00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:54.604
SEE YA NEXT TIME
