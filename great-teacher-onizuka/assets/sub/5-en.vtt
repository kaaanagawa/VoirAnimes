WEBVTT

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.949
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:27.219
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:32.330
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:38.068
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.841
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.810
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.886
Let's cut loose until
We reach our limit

00:00:55.155 --> 00:01:00.684
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.352
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:08.023
Flash!
I'm the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:13.237
Toward the finish line

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:43.740
Daddy bought a car.
You know that, right?

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:49.814
It's a Cresta. Not only that,
it's white pearl and exceeds 2.5.

00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:52.610
Wasn't it destroyed?

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.653
By a teacher named Oni-something?

00:01:56.923 --> 00:02:02.054
Thanks to my insurance, my Cresta
is coming back to me brand-new.

00:02:02.262 --> 00:02:05.698
So, I thought maybe
we could go on a trip...

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.834
...to a hot spring in my Cresta.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:12.300
I wanna pass.
I don't feel up to it.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:16.237
I'd rather play with my friends.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.214
Well, I don't mind buying you...

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:35.918
...the bag you always wanted.

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:39.796
Really? I'll go! I'll go!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.730
Mom, you're going too, right?

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:48.938
I want a ring too.

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:52.475
No problem.

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:57.649
As long as I have my Cresta,
I can have a happy family...

00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.982
... with my lovely daughter and
loving wife back just like before.

00:03:04.124 --> 00:03:07.184
I won't get involved
with Onizuka anymore.

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:12.696
In my Cresta, my white Cresta...

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:18.997
...I will go on
a long-awaited family trip!

00:03:19.206 --> 00:03:20.935
Thank you!

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:33.682
I heard this story from my superior
in the motorcycle gang.

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:38.051
In a certain town,
there was a rumor that...

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:41.455
...a store was making Shumai
with human flesh.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:46.860
This guy, who was known for his
fearlessness, ignored the rumor...

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.035
Terror of Shumai

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:52.569
...and decided to buy
a box of Shumai there.

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:54.831
But then, on his way home...

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:57.532
Kiyo-Ken Shumai

00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:03.205
...he felt uneasy for some reason,
so he turned around...

00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:06.175
...and saw no one.

00:04:06.386 --> 00:04:11.187
He couldn't stop feeling uneasy,
so he removed the lid of the box.

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:14.519
When he opened it...?

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:18.822
One Shumai was missing.

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:27.671
Though this guy got a chill
down his back...

00:04:27.874 --> 00:04:33.141
...he convinced himself that one
was missing from the beginning.

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:36.679
But he couldn't stop
thinking about it.

00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:39.977
He opened the box again
at the next corner.

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:46.056
Another Shumai was missing.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.127
By now he was freaked out
and hurried home.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.428
Then he calmed down
and opened the lid again.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:58.228
This time...

00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:03.432
...believe it or not, three more
were missing all at once!

00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:09.144
The guy was so scared
that he screamed!

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.340
Then he put the lid back on.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:17.386
Once more, slowly,
he opened the lid.

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:21.222
None! There was none left!

00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:26.923
There were absolutely no Shumai left!
What was going on?

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:31.263
Though he was scared,
he looked into the box carefully.

00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.234
Then, he saw...

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.945
...all the Shumai stuck
on the back of the lid.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.794
What the hell is that?
It's so dumb!

00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:01.229
It's so dumb but it makes me laugh!

00:06:08.274 --> 00:06:13.268
Okay, so much for today's class.
Wasn't it fun?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.683
Next time I'll tell you
the story of Scary White Jam.

00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:21.979
So, look forward to it. See you!

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:35.226
You guys!

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:40.099
Why in the world are you having fun
in Onizuka's class? Betrayers!

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:43.833
Do you hear me? Never laugh
in front of him again!

00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:46.740
If you do, you'll be executed!

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:51.812
What happened, Kikuchi?
I expected you would do a better job.

00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:57.052
That bastard, Onizuka.
He doesn't seem to be crushed at all.

00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.658
I can't help it. If you aren't happy,
why don't you do it yourself?

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.098
Sorry, but I don't wanna
participate this time.

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.059
Wait a minute!
What do you mean by that?

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:24.012
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing in particular.

00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:26.844
He makes me mad.

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:33.185
You know what? I hear that Yoshikawa
visits Onizuka in his room often.

00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:49.067
-You mean Onizuka?
-Yeah.

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:53.006
When I told him I knew
who made the composite photo....

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:55.340
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:07:55.548 --> 00:08:01.612
Anyway, he scolded me and said,
"Don't tell on your buddies."

00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:07.685
Also, he said, "I'll make school fun."

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:12.456
Whether he was blowing smoke,
I've never heard a teacher say that.

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:16.362
If you get to know him better,
you'll probably....

00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:21.164
What are you saying?

00:08:21.374 --> 00:08:26.402
Just because I didn't participate
this time doesn't mean I endorse him.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:28.478
Kikuchi....

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:32.981
If we trust a teacher, we'll be
betrayed again like before.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.688
-How has it been in Class 3-4?
-What do you mean?

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.057
Are you being harassed?

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:50.134
Harassed? What the heck is that?

00:08:50.537 --> 00:08:54.997
I'm doing fine.
I'm having fun with my students.

00:08:55.208 --> 00:09:00.077
My students seem to like my class
so much, I don't know what to do.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.444
Is that so? But the other teachers
are talking about you.

00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.951
They say it's time Onizuka-sensei
felt the stress accumulating.

00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:14.218
Also, the vice principal doesn't
seem to like you much.

00:09:14.427 --> 00:09:18.261
So, I'm a little concerned.

00:09:21.234 --> 00:09:24.692
You do have some concerns, right?

00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:30.408
Great! I found new items!

00:09:31.878 --> 00:09:36.110
-You're too much.
-Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:42.250
-Don't you want to play this with me?
-I'm not too crazy about games.

00:09:42.455 --> 00:09:47.859
Here, this is a really fun part.
I'll teach you. See? There!

00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.963
-Oh, is this how it goes?
-Right, right.

00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:54.099
This way? Right?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.701
That's right. Isn't it easy?

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.735
She smells good.

00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.572
What do I do next?

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:11.110
Oh, no!

00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:15.477
You are accumulating stress!

00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:20.352
It's not really stress.
Something else is accumulating.

00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:30.794
Oh, Yoshikawa.
What's the matter? Come in.

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:34.332
Oh, no. I don't want to intrude.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.637
-I have to ask you something.
-What is it?

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:43.907
Right here. I've been trying
so hard to clear this level.

00:10:44.117 --> 00:10:46.517
-You can't use that item.
-What?

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:49.620
You need to use this
to clear that. Here.

00:10:49.822 --> 00:10:52.655
-Oh, I see.
-That's right.

00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:57.125
-Like this? This way?
-No, no. Use this for that.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.696
Oh, not this one?

00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:04.301
-I already told you about that.
-What?

00:11:04.504 --> 00:11:07.701
I'll come over again
when I get new software.

00:11:07.907 --> 00:11:10.171
I'm counting on you, Yoshikawa!

00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:15.678
-Of course, it'll be after I clear it.
-Gosh, you're so stingy.

00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:23.121
Hey, Yoshikawa.

00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:33.191
I wanna talk to you.
You'll come with me, won't you?

00:11:39.706 --> 00:11:40.764
Don't. Stop!

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:44.238
Idiot! You shouldn't
hang out with Onizuka!

00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:48.744
You know our class rules.
You could get capital punishment.

00:11:56.022 --> 00:12:00.254
Understand? If I see you being
friendly with Onizuka again...

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.918
...I'll scatter this photo
all over town.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.659
And I'll add a caption saying, "I had
my naked picture taken by girls."

00:12:09.869 --> 00:12:11.530
He's got a little thing!

00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:15.105
Pretty pathetic!
But it's a nice cap, Yoshikawa.

00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:17.469
How cute!

00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:24.208
-Add some doodles.
-How artistic!

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:28.786
-Oh, he's started to cry.
-Do you think that's manly?

00:12:28.988 --> 00:12:32.446
Pay no more attention to him.
Let's go to karaoke!

00:12:32.658 --> 00:12:35.218
Oh, I love it! What shall I sing?

00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:39.888
-Got to be L'Arc.
-No, it's got to be Enka, Enka!

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.607
Onizuka?

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:54.474
Have you finished the photos you
promised me? I'm tired of waiting.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.875
I didn't promise you anything!

00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:58.072
Come on.

00:12:58.518 --> 00:13:01.214
Don't be so cold.

00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:06.120
I have an idea! What if I give you
10 combo-A lunch tickets?

00:13:06.325 --> 00:13:10.989
I'll have them copied so well that
no one will know they're fake!

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:13.392
Isn't that counterfeiting?

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:16.864
If the school finds out,
you'll be in trouble.

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:20.197
Oh, hush. It's fine
as long as no one knows.

00:13:20.406 --> 00:13:24.968
I'll be waiting in 30 minutes
at the front door. See you then.

00:13:25.378 --> 00:13:29.610
Hey, wait a minute! Don't decide
all by yourself, Onizuka!

00:13:35.054 --> 00:13:39.991
I can't believe
such an idiot is a teacher.

00:13:41.327 --> 00:13:44.319
I can't wait!

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:50.093
This will be an additional page in
the Onizuka Female Body Collection.

00:13:50.303 --> 00:13:53.932
Maybe I'll ask him to use
Fuyutsuki's face next time.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.665
Could I? Should I?

00:14:04.784 --> 00:14:06.684
Yoshikawa?

00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:14.115
When I come home in this Cresta...

00:14:14.327 --> 00:14:17.387
...how will my wife
and daughter react?

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:25.331
I'll hurry home so that I can
make plans for our family trip!

00:14:28.808 --> 00:14:31.242
Onizuka?

00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.026
Daddy!

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.702
-Daddy's Cresta is cool!
-Now I think better of you, honey!

00:14:49.904 --> 00:14:52.464
We love you!

00:14:53.374 --> 00:14:57.435
This Cresta will help me
regain my dignity as a father...

00:14:57.645 --> 00:15:00.478
...and my happy family.

00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:03.742
All I need is my Cresta!

00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:09.349
Onizuka!

00:15:51.432 --> 00:15:53.525
Oh, ouch.

00:15:54.869 --> 00:15:57.133
Here we are.

00:15:57.338 --> 00:15:59.806
It's absurd.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.740
What the hell were you thinking?
You idiot!

00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:08.745
Yoshikawa?

00:16:09.884 --> 00:16:13.684
My Cresta....

00:16:14.489 --> 00:16:16.923
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:21.027
I told you so many times
not to kill yourself!

00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:24.422
You....

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.073
Aren't you mad at yourself?

00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:37.506
Even if you die, it won't make you
feel better, will it?

00:16:37.712 --> 00:16:42.115
I'm frustrated and mad at myself.
Of course I'm frustrated!

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.179
Mad....

00:16:46.254 --> 00:16:50.691
Good. That's good. Good job.

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:54.253
Well, lead the way.

00:16:54.462 --> 00:16:57.397
Revenge, it will be done.

00:17:06.174 --> 00:17:09.337
Yoshikawa's face was priceless!

00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:11.705
This photo is just too funny.

00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:16.316
He's not gonna approach
Onizuka anymore.

00:17:16.517 --> 00:17:20.578
Because we have such
an embarrassing picture.

00:17:20.788 --> 00:17:25.521
But Anko is so nasty. I never
imagined it would go this far.

00:17:25.727 --> 00:17:29.720
It's just because Murai
and Kikuchi were such weaklings.

00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:33.799
I don't feel well
unless we go that far.

00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:36.869
Anko, your song is ready.

00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.666
-Here is your microphone.
-Thank you!

00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:45.739
Who is it?

00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:49.849
It's me.

00:17:50.051 --> 00:17:55.353
-Onizuka! Why are you here?
-What kind of disguise it that?

00:17:55.556 --> 00:17:59.890
You came out like a cockroach,
out of nowhere, you bastard!

00:18:00.094 --> 00:18:05.361
Who are you calling a roach,
you perverted middle school girls?

00:18:07.435 --> 00:18:10.199
What do you mean?

00:18:10.538 --> 00:18:12.631
Don't play innocent.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.334
You pulled down a guy's pants
and took naked pictures of him.

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:21.675
I have no idea what this is
all about. Right, everyone?

00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:24.477
Right. What are you talking about?

00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:29.012
Oh, really?
Hey, Yoshikawa, come on in!

00:18:29.223 --> 00:18:31.384
No Carry-In Food and Drink

00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:36.521
You bastard! You know what's
gonna happen to you, Yoshikawa!

00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:39.666
That photo will be all over town!

00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:45.430
You'll live a painful and embarrassing
lie. No one will respect you again!

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.838
Well, now we begin the revenge!

00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:54.105
-Take your time to be daring!
-Move over!

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:06.522
-How can you?!
-Bad kids get a spanking!

00:19:07.128 --> 00:19:09.961
Onizuka! You bastard!

00:19:10.164 --> 00:19:12.462
Stop it! It hurts!

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:16.125
Hurts? Look who's talking!

00:19:16.337 --> 00:19:21.070
This is nothing compared to
the pain Yoshikawa has suffered.

00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:22.501
You bastard!

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:28.342
Yoshikawa, don't think we'll be done
with just scattering your photos!

00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:31.513
Now, to finish it off.

00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:39.254
-What--?
-No, stop, don't!

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.419
What a wonderful view,
isn't it, Yoshikawa?

00:19:43.631 --> 00:19:46.566
Forgive me from my heinie
Sorry, Naoko's butt

00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:50.898
Apology on my heinie
Mayuko's butt

00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:56.934
-Now, next....
-No, wait! What are you going to do?

00:19:57.145 --> 00:19:59.841
I'm gonna take a commemorative photo.

00:20:00.047 --> 00:20:04.074
Stop it! You're violating
our human rights, you pervert!

00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:06.845
Hey! Are you listening, Onizuka?

00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:12.156
-No, stop it!
-Please!

00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:23.029
Listen to me. You've learned your
lesson. Don't ever bully anyone again.

00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:29.640
Here, Yoshikawa.

00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:36.617
Take care of the rest on your own.

00:20:37.118 --> 00:20:40.815
Shit. You think you're a hero
of justice or something?

00:20:41.022 --> 00:20:45.015
Do you think it's right
to do this to girls?

00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:48.684
I'm going to take this to the PTA!

00:20:51.465 --> 00:20:54.093
That's just fine with me!

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:59.137
Bring me the PTA or PCB
or whatever you like!

00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:03.542
I'm just one teacher,
Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old!

00:21:03.744 --> 00:21:06.611
I won't run away or hide!

00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:10.950
There's no gender distinction
among the bad!

00:21:11.152 --> 00:21:15.054
That is my policy.
Keep that in mind!

00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:26.959
Teacher, I'm hungry.

00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:32.138
-Yeah. Let's go eat ramen.
-Okay.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.936
-By the way, do you have some money?
-What?

00:21:52.593 --> 00:21:55.619
Did you leave the camera behind?

00:21:56.297 --> 00:21:59.789
Well, it's all up to you.

00:22:00.768 --> 00:22:04.295
-Teacher?
-Yeah?

00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:12.604
No matter what happens,
I'll never try to kill myself again.

00:22:12.813 --> 00:22:14.906
I promise.

00:22:16.717 --> 00:22:19.652
-Yoshikawa.
-What?

00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:25.954
-That ramen you bought was horrible.
-What?

00:22:42.843 --> 00:22:48.247
Hurry back into your classroom.
Time for homeroom.

00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:51.714
Is the Board Chairman in?

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:55.787
Excuse me, but let me
tell her who it is....

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.189
-Are you a new hire from this spring?
-Well, yes.

00:23:02.863 --> 00:23:06.731
No wonder you don't know me.

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:12.537
I am president of the PTA
of this school...

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.833
...Uehara.

00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:17.340
I heard a teacher named Onizuka...

00:23:17.545 --> 00:23:21.037
...performed the most shameless act
on my daughter.

00:23:21.248 --> 00:23:25.014
So I want to talk to the Chairman.

00:23:41.602 --> 00:23:45.800
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.034
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.245 --> 00:23:56.080
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.317 --> 00:24:02.017
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:06.420
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.194 --> 00:24:11.631
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.235
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:21.837
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.077 --> 00:24:32.645
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:42.618
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.062
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:52.136
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:57.241
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.478 --> 00:25:03.815
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:14.695 --> 00:25:15.719
Next Episode

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.764
-What's wrong?
-Uehara's mother is at the school.

00:25:20.434 --> 00:25:24.871
Is that all? You can't be a teacher
if you're afraid of the PTA.

00:25:25.072 --> 00:25:26.198
Repentance

00:25:26.407 --> 00:25:30.844
I'm calling an emergency PTA meeting!

00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:45.757
Watch your mouth.
I'm playing mindfully.
