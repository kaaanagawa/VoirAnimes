Strange rumor, you said?

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.696
At the kiosk, I heard...

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.482
... that recently teacher "S"
seems weird or something...

00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.252
I'm wondering
who teacher "S" is...

00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:02.049
Is the teacher "S"...

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:05.752
... me? Sakurada?

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:09.083
By the way, Sakurada-sensei...

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.115
About the collection
of money for the school trip...

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:17.726
... why did you change the
collection method to cash this year?

00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:24.331
The reason is that the company
in charge asked us to do it....

00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:25.628
Oh, well...

00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:31.740
Excuse me! I've had problems
with my stomach, head and heart...

00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.434
They're all bad...!

00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:36.203
I'd like to take
a medical leave for a while!

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:49.086
Everyone.
Be quiet! Calm down!

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:51.727
Now we'd like to take your votes...

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.559
... on whether
we should fire Onizuka-sensei.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.693
Before that,
explain the situation, Baldy!

00:02:58.102 --> 00:03:01.071
That's right!
We have the right to know!

00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:02.730
Don't give us
a vague answer, Baldy!

00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:05.870
Hey, you guys! Be quiet!

00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:07.934
- Don't throw anything!
- Shut up, PE teacher!

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.569
We're just saying
he should tell the truth!

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:10.806
That's right! Back off!

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.488
Leave me alone!
You're treating me like a criminal!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.754
You set up our teacher
because you wanted the money.

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.224
You're the same as a criminal.

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:26.422
I was just asked to do it by Miyabi.

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.192
Shut up!
Don't make any excuses.

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:32.430
If you testify,
Onizuka can stay at the school.

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.094
Shut up and come with us!

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.235
What are you guys doing?

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.034
Onizuka...

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.574
Fujiyoshi was safe.
Good. I'm so glad.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.906
Where were you?!

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:48.415
While you were gone,
it's been a mess at school!

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.288
Look at this!

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:54.686
These letters say
you're charged with embezzlement!

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.820
Miyabi set up all of them.

00:03:57.662 --> 00:03:59.095
She stole
the money from Fujiyoshi...

00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:00.686
...and put it in your clothes.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.423
She gathered students...

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.296
...from other schools
and made up the bar.

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:05.535
I knew that.

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:06.603
What?!

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:09.461
What is it?!

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:13.034
Without make-up,
you look much better.

00:04:13.144 --> 00:04:15.271
It isn't time to be easy!

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:19.141
We troubled you. Sorry.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.844
Please go home now. All right?

00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:23.977
What? Don't mess with me!

00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:26.420
What's going on at this school?!

00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:31.719
Hey, Onizuka.
What are you thinking?

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:34.059
She's an important witness.

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.796
Don't say such a stupid thing.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.835
When the witness says...

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:41.461
... I was set up
by a young female amateur...

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.405
... I'll be too ashamed
of myself to walk outside.

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.002
But if you didn't do anything...!

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:50.612
Just watch me.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.808
I'll show you how I finish my work.

00:04:56.954 --> 00:05:00.253
Finish your work?
You're going to the gym?!

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.357
It isn't a good idea
to enter there now!

00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:08.959
Don't you understand
I'm saying "Be quiet"?!

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.033
Hey, Baldy!

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.466
If you don't explain it to us,
we won't pay our tuition!

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:14.661
Don't call me Baldy!

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:17.497
Now then, we'll take your votes.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:20.075
Raise your hands
if you agree to fire Onizuka.

00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:31.751
Onizuka!

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.112
Onizuka...

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:42.761
Fujiyoshi is safe.
Don't worry about him.

00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:49.272
Why did you come here?

00:05:50.908 --> 00:05:51.932
You are a criminal!

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.504
How could you come here
without shame?!

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:56.170
Hey, are you listening to me?!

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.007
Why is your attitude so arrogant?

00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:59.946
Put down your arms! Hey!

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.108
What?!

00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:12.226
Hi, everyone.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:14.160
I'm Onizuka,
charged with embezzlement.

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:15.289
Greetings!

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:16.791
What?! Did he really do it?

00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:18.232
I can't believe it!

00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:21.931
I really did it.

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.331
I'm Onizuka,
responsible for embezzlement.

00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:26.706
- Why are you proud of it?!
- You're an arrogant thief!

00:06:27.144 --> 00:06:28.111
That idiot...

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.146
Shut up!
You'll be happy if I return it, right?!

00:06:32.483 --> 00:06:35.543
I'll return the money
down to the penny!

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.218
If I do that
you won't complain, will you?!

00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:40.119
If that's all, we don't need police!

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:41.316
Go away, you con man!

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:45.221
Then I'll give you
an extra 10, 000 yen with cash!

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.797
How about that?!
Isn't it great?!

00:06:47.898 --> 00:06:49.422
That's not enough!

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:51.194
Don't bribe your students!
You evil teacher!

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:52.269
I can't believe this!

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:56.105
How dare you bribe the students?!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.765
Shut up!

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.246
All right! I got it!

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:06.616
You've said this much,
I've made my decision!

00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:09.014
Listen, third-year students!

00:07:09.253 --> 00:07:10.686
Clean your ears...

00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:11.914
... and listen to me carefully!

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.587
I won't talk
about this little school trip!

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:16.990
Instead of the trip
to Mt. Yatsugatake...

00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:19.027
... I'll take all of you
to the blue ocean...

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:21.596
...full of kiwi, papaya and mango!

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.564
I'll take you to Okinawa!

00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:25.427
Three nights and four days
at a luxurious hotel!

00:07:25.536 --> 00:07:27.970
"Poisonous snakes
and mongoose show!" is included!

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:31.303
It's a deluxe plan!
Outrageous service plan!

00:07:40.885 --> 00:07:42.546
He said Okinawa!

00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:44.450
Take us there!

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.823
Count on me!

00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:49.115
If you don't take us,
we'll get you fired!

00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:50.989
All right. Go ahead!

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.188
Bring the Ministry of Education
or whoever you like!

00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:56.229
What is he talking about?

00:07:57.067 --> 00:07:58.625
All the third-year students
to Okinawa?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.599
Considering
40 students in one class...

00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:03.502
... it'll cost about eight million yen.

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:05.698
Eight million?!

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.268
It's impossible.

00:08:07.378 --> 00:08:09.005
He can't even afford
his own cigarettes.

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.603
There is no way
he has that much money.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:14.476
- Do you want to see the blue ocean?!
- Yeah!!!

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:16.378
Amazing...

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:21.282
The students were accusing
Onizuka-sensei so fiercely.

00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:23.993
But he has drawn them to him
in a blink of an eye.

00:08:24.094 --> 00:08:25.391
As usual, he's amazing.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.397
Rather than drawing in the students,
he used bait for them.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.866
It is an unforgivable method
for a teacher.

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:36.237
It's interesting.
Let him do it.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.839
Onizuka-sensei, I'll be watching...

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.477
...your ability as a teacher,
no, as a human being...

00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:48.815
Well, what kind of performance
are you showing me this time...?

00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:52.151
What are you going to do?!
You were showing off.

00:08:52.256 --> 00:08:53.746
Eight million yen!
Eight million yen!

00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:55.886
There is no way
you can make that much money.

00:08:56.727 --> 00:08:57.853
Idiot!

00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:00.429
Do you think I'm stupid enough
to promise something like that...

00:09:00.564 --> 00:09:02.725
...without having any plan?

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:03.822
What?!

00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:05.868
I have something I'm counting on.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.097
I have a winning lottery ticket
for ten million yen...

00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:09.934
I got it from my friend as collateral.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.029
No way!

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.467
Here!

00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:17.212
Isn't it great? I lent my friend,
who is a police officer, 100,000 yen.

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:19.874
In exchange,
I got this as collateral from him.

00:09:20.384 --> 00:09:24.377
I feel sorry for him.
But I guess I have to use it.

00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:27.588
Is this really a winning ticket?

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:28.847
Of course!

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:32.790
Do I look like a monkey
who can't tell if this is fake?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.089
Here it is! Look at this!

00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:37.359
Here is a copy of the newspaper.

00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:39.368
This can't be a fake ticket.

00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:44.303
All right! Let's cash this
and maybe have a good meal!

00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:47.600
Teacher, this is a fake.

00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.469
What?

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.112
This number is hand-written.

00:09:52.549 --> 00:09:55.017
What?! There's no way!

00:09:57.454 --> 00:09:58.512
You're right!

00:09:58.956 --> 00:10:00.287
The number 7 is bigger!

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.656
It's wise to change the newspaper...

00:10:03.827 --> 00:10:04.851
...instead of the lottery ticket.

00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:06.554
Even a monkey can figure it out.

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:08.359
It is a winning ticket, though.

00:10:08.465 --> 00:10:09.432
Really?!

00:10:09.633 --> 00:10:10.861
Just for 100 yen.

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:16.337
Saejima!
He took advantage of my innocence!

00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:20.209
I've made the estimate report.

00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.578
What?

00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:24.405
Onizuka-sensei, you're great...

00:10:24.581 --> 00:10:28.278
...to take all the third-years
to Okinawa with your personal funds.

00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:30.979
Oh, principal, as a matter of fact...

00:10:31.388 --> 00:10:36.223
Here is the estimate.
8,230,025 yen.

00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:39.191
We can't change
our plans anymore.

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:41.628
Please pay it within a week.

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:43.127
A week?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.624
That's right.

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.202
I don't care...

00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:49.271
... if you have to go
tuna fishing to do it.

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:51.407
Just get the money.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.040
You may look good
as a man of the sea.

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:01.242
Don't convince me like that!

00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:05.678
Hey! Where are you going?!

00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.445
KIUI PAPAIYA MANGUUSU
(KIWI PAPAYA MONGOOSE)

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:14.639
Hello. Oh, Chikako?
Did Onizuka say that?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.398
I guess that idiot panicked...

00:11:16.508 --> 00:11:17.736
...and dug his own grave.

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:21.912
I see. Just in case,
I acted sick and took today off...

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.979
...I guess I didn't need to do that.

00:11:24.302 --> 00:11:26.793
All right.
I'm going tomorrow. See you.

00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:33.633
Attempted suicide?

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:35.146
Yes.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.579
Our bank used to finance
a small factory called Hiramatsu Metal.

00:11:38.683 --> 00:11:42.517
But our bank was
in bad condition like everyone else.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.985
So we stopped financing it.

00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:47.314
The president tried to jump
in front of the car right then.

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:48.459
Oh...!

00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:51.455
I'm the director,
but I can't do anything.

00:11:51.563 --> 00:11:53.428
Everything is determined
at the upper level.

00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.828
Do you have
to go on a business trip...

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:56.423
...to the countryside
in the middle of all this?

00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:57.928
I leave tomorrow.

00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:01.095
I was pretty mad,
and I took paid time off today.

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:02.734
Is that so...?

00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:05.335
Oh, Miyabi-chan.

00:12:05.877 --> 00:12:07.003
How about school today?

00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:09.372
I have a summer cold,
and I took a day off.

00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:11.975
Really.
This was a rare day off...

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.381
...so I was thinking
of going out for dinner.

00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:16.211
What?! I want to go!

00:12:16.387 --> 00:12:18.287
No, you have a cold.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:19.754
Shoot! No fun.

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:24.326
Hello!
It's me, Saejima, the producer!

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:26.329
What?
You want me come to the store?

00:12:26.598 --> 00:12:29.396
Well, I've been busy these days.

00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:31.696
Location hunting
and others things...

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.305
What? Autograph?
Sure. I can get it for you!

00:12:35.907 --> 00:12:39.775
Before that, let's do it once...
I mean, let's go out on a date...

00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:43.237
Hey, Saejima.

00:12:44.148 --> 00:12:48.949
Hey, Eikichi! What's up?!

00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:51.345
What's up??

00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:53.686
You gave me a fake lottery ticket!

00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:57.659
Do you want your head to be split?

00:12:57.762 --> 00:12:59.627
Wait! Calm down!

00:13:00.532 --> 00:13:02.762
It was a winning ticket.

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:05.461
Just the winning amount
was different.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.030
I didn't say
that it won ten million yen.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.370
That's fraud.

00:13:11.643 --> 00:13:12.905
Are you going...

00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:14.841
...to open up your head?
It would be like a red flower!

00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:19.649
Let's negotiate.
I'll give you an alternative.

00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.776
Alternative?

00:13:25.723 --> 00:13:28.749
I'll give this to you.
So sell it secretly.

00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:31.088
If you sell it all,
it'll be way over 100 million yen.

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.424
This is just regular flour.

00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:40.699
You! Saejima!
You're trying to deceive me again!

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:43.399
I can't forgive you now!
I'll kill you and myself!

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.073
Take him out quickly!

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:46.473
Onizuka! What are you thinking?!

00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:49.547
Leave me alone! Let me die!

00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:51.911
Eikichi!
You can challenge me anytime!

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.042
Shit! I'll kill him and myself!

00:13:55.186 --> 00:13:56.517
Stop it!

00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:58.612
If you consider even death,
you can manage anything.

00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:01.724
Consider death...

00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:06.129
Don't kill yourself!

00:14:06.297 --> 00:14:08.765
I have to do it!
I really need eight million yen!

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:10.527
I need to get hit for compensation!

00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:12.500
But why do you need to jump
onto the metropolitan highway?

00:14:12.637 --> 00:14:16.198
The more badly I get messed up,
the more money I can get!

00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:19.041
What are you doing?

00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:23.442
If I can't get hit by a car,
I have to go with counterfeiting.

00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:25.945
Look at this.
Doesn't it look good?

00:14:26.384 --> 00:14:28.375
What could be better than this...?

00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:31.954
With such an obvious counterfeit...

00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:34.115
...you can't deceive
even a grandma at a candy shop.

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:37.193
That isn't true!
Look at this masterpiece.

00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:40.460
Why does Yukichi Fukuzawa
have a regent hair style?

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:43.297
That's my style...

00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:46.136
This isn't the character for one
on a 10,000 yen bill.

00:14:47.605 --> 00:14:49.197
Then what should I do?!

00:14:49.307 --> 00:14:50.604
I have an idea!

00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:52.403
How about digging
in Inogashira Park...

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.670
...to look for hot springs?

00:14:53.978 --> 00:14:56.105
You can't find a hot spring
in Inogashira Park.

00:14:56.914 --> 00:14:59.974
All right!
No other way! I'm a man!

00:15:00.485 --> 00:15:02.646
I'm going to use my last weapon!

00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:05.417
Sell my internal organs.

00:15:05.523 --> 00:15:06.490
Don't joke!

00:15:06.924 --> 00:15:09.825
I hear the length of the intestine
is about ten meters.

00:15:09.927 --> 00:15:11.827
If I sell it one million per meter...

00:15:11.929 --> 00:15:13.294
It isn't a speaker cord!

00:15:13.398 --> 00:15:15.525
How can you sell
your intestines by the meter?

00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:18.293
Then what do you want me to do?!

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.160
That's the only way...

00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:22.896
What?! Do you have an idea?

00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:25.405
Getting on the tuna boat.

00:15:26.077 --> 00:15:27.635
You! I'll kill you!

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:28.803
Calm down!

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.676
Making eight million yen
in a week is impossible!

00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:34.885
Impossible or not, I have to do it!

00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:40.119
All right.
We have to use an illegal method.

00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:41.920
What?

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.251
PACHINKO

00:15:56.574 --> 00:15:58.269
How is it, teacher?

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:01.670
How is it? Great, great!

00:16:02.413 --> 00:16:05.007
Can you see these treasure boxes?

00:16:05.149 --> 00:16:07.310
You're great, Kikuchi-chan!

00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:09.545
Hide a strong magnet in the wig...

00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:11.417
...and lead the balls.

00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:13.080
You're a genius! Really!

00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:14.453
Idiot! You're too loud!

00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:19.354
Great power of the magnet!

00:16:21.966 --> 00:16:24.434
Young man,
what about the magnet?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.834
Do you want us to flip you a little?

00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:30.373
Withdraw!

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:31.806
Return the balls!

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:42.545
Expected three-year-old
Great Goblin didn't win!

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.659
No. 6, No. 3! Then No. 4 is coming!
This is a surprise!

00:16:57.702 --> 00:17:01.502
I just saw teacher.
He looked like a ghost.

00:17:01.973 --> 00:17:03.907
Shit! Even if he got an extra job...

00:17:04.008 --> 00:17:06.306
...there is no way
to make eight million in five days.

00:17:06.511 --> 00:17:08.479
Then he will really get fired...?

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.546
Don't say that.

00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:13.442
As long as he hasn't given up,
we can't give up.

00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:14.518
But...

00:17:15.186 --> 00:17:16.153
Hello!

00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:18.984
How's it going? Making money?

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.057
You!

00:17:20.258 --> 00:17:21.486
Oh, excuse me!

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:24.387
The great teacher
Onizuka wouldn't say that...

00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:26.360
...without having enough money.

00:17:27.031 --> 00:17:30.296
And with so many
smart people helping...

00:17:30.468 --> 00:17:32.402
...I'm sure
something will work out. Right?

00:17:32.503 --> 00:17:33.527
Aizawa...!

00:17:35.907 --> 00:17:37.499
Don't give that scary look.

00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:40.703
We were friends as members
of Class 2-4 until just recently.

00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:43.470
Oh, well. Hang in there.

00:17:43.714 --> 00:17:45.341
Hey, Aizawa! Wait!

00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:46.416
You!

00:17:52.623 --> 00:17:54.557
Really, you're a stupid guy.

00:17:56.194 --> 00:17:59.254
It isn't your fault this happened.
But you do this anyway.

00:18:00.131 --> 00:18:01.098
Uehara...

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:04.294
Why can't you just say it's Miyabi?

00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:07.799
Uehara...

00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:11.174
Are you wearing
Hello Kitty underwear?

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:13.866
What?! Listen to me seriously!

00:18:13.978 --> 00:18:14.945
Teacher...

00:18:15.813 --> 00:18:16.780
Yoshikawa...

00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:18.838
Here is 60,000 yen.

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:22.349
I made this by selling
all my game software.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.383
I thought it might help a little.

00:18:24.889 --> 00:18:28.791
And use this account, too.
Three million yen is in there.

00:18:29.227 --> 00:18:31.559
Three, three, three million...?

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.154
Don't worry about it.

00:18:34.298 --> 00:18:36.425
My parents saved it for me
in my account.

00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:38.396
I don't need it for a while.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.564
Are you stupid?!
It's your parents' money!

00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:45.275
If you give it to him,
he'll never return it!

00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:46.343
Do you understand?

00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.076
Oh, how irritating!

00:18:48.212 --> 00:18:50.680
This is why I want to bully you!

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:53.346
That's all right.

00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.651
I just want him to stay
at school even a little bit longer...

00:18:59.557 --> 00:19:02.651
Because of him, I'm becoming...

00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:07.625
All right! There is one way...!

00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:12.067
I think you can cash
at least one million yen.

00:19:13.004 --> 00:19:15.438
I'll report
a stolen cash card in one hour.

00:19:15.539 --> 00:19:16.665
So take the money by then.

00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:17.763
Uehara...

00:19:18.175 --> 00:19:20.234
Hey! Why don't you go now?!

00:19:25.316 --> 00:19:26.510
Put these away!
Please put these away!

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:29.752
Quick!
Otherwise, I may really use them!

00:19:30.888 --> 00:19:32.253
What are you talking about?!

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.915
Within several hours,
you'll have only four days left!

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:37.454
It's impossible for you
to make eight million yen!

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:40.427
That's right, teacher.
Please use it!

00:19:41.532 --> 00:19:45.662
Idiot. How can a teacher
borrow money from his students?

00:19:46.203 --> 00:19:49.229
Don't worry about it.
I'm a man!

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.471
I'm the man among men!

00:19:52.243 --> 00:19:54.711
The man may not have money...

00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:56.971
... but he has
a great treasure called best friend.

00:19:57.081 --> 00:19:58.048
Best friend?

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.786
Yeah. We went through
life and death together.

00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:04.920
When my life is in danger...

00:20:05.022 --> 00:20:06.819
... he'll come to help me...

00:20:06.924 --> 00:20:08.858
...at the risk of his own life.

00:20:12.163 --> 00:20:15.098
If he finds out
my situation, he'll definitely...

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:22.605
Eight million yen?
Of course not! Idiot!

00:20:25.643 --> 00:20:27.736
They may put me
on the tuna boat!

00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:30.277
Aren't we best friends?

00:20:30.948 --> 00:20:33.678
A tuna boat? Sounds good.

00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:36.483
Why don't you go
to the Indian Ocean?

00:20:36.754 --> 00:20:40.315
And make another 870,000
which I lent you.

00:20:41.993 --> 00:20:45.588
What happened
to the legendary Onibaku Pair?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.858
I forgot.
