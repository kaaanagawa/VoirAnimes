WEBVTT

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:21.390
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:27.701
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:32.770
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:38.509
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.282
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:49.251
Let's burn together
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:55.327
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.596 --> 00:01:01.125
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.793
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.464
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:13.678
Toward the finish line

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:50.814
Come on! Raise your thighs higher!
Run more briskly! Brisk!

00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:59.395
Hajime Fukuroda
32 years old Single

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:03.124
Nippori Sports College graduate.
Hobby: weight-training.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:06.929
Favorite saying: "Don't think.
Grasp with your body. "

00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:20.614
Hey, Miyazaki! Who told you
you could wear sweatpants?

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.883
-What? What? But--
-No buts! Take them off right away!

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.422
Yes, sir.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.861
Very well.

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:35.692
No!

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:41.134
You girls are slacking off!
Around the field three more times!

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.307
Fukuroda is the worst!

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:46.136
-He's a bossy jerk!
-He's like a Hokuroda.

00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:49.609
-He's a sadomasochist!
-What's with the megaphone?

00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:54.649
It's pathetic how students
nowadays grow up so big...

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:58.447
...but psychologically
they aren't disciplined.

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.921
I need to treat them
more strictly. Strictly.

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:04.253
Teacher, watch out!

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.328
How was it? Did it fly?

00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:13.798
It did fly, but....

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.565
What flew was Fukuroda.

00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:19.334
It was a direct hit in his face.

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.274
He got up!
He's coming this way!

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.506
-Run!
-What are you talking about?

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:28.747
Who did this?!

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:34.955
-Onizuka-sensei?
-Withdraw!

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.459
What are you doing in the middle
of class? Wait a second!

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:43.191
-What was that?
-A P.E. teacher couldn't avoid it?

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:48.464
Who said that?
Come forward! Right here!

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.474
Answer me!

00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:55.111
-Let's get back.
-Let's go.

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:58.373
Hey! All of you! Ten more laps!

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:02.075
The bell already rang.
Thank you very much.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.692
That bastard! Onizuka!

00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:21.433
What are you guys thinking?

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.802
You're having fun hanging out
with your teacher.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.910
What the hell are you guys thinking?

00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:33.174
Don't be quiet. Say something!
How about you, Murai?

00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:37.777
Why does it matter?
Don't worry about it.

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:39.388
What do you mean?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.684
There is something about him.

00:04:42.894 --> 00:04:47.092
He's like a race of his own.
I don't know what it is.

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:50.961
-He's not even human!
-He's got guardian spirits.

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.004
That's right. He is definitely
protected by someone like Hyakutaro.

00:04:56.207 --> 00:05:00.200
If you still wanna play tricks
on him, do it on your own.

00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.379
It won't work, though.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.710
Fukuroda went totally nuts!
He's looking for Onizuka.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:10.418
-Are you serious?
-Being hit in the face did it.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:12.655
-It's not good.
-Let's run!

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:16.084
What do we do?
If they won't participate...

00:05:16.294 --> 00:05:19.730
...it means that half
the class is for Onizuka.

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.764
-It doesn't matter.
-Miyabi.

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.935
I'll never forget.

00:05:25.136 --> 00:05:29.072
Absolutely no teachers are
trustworthy. No one!

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:32.669
Onizuka.

00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:37.780
You play with your students during
your class, disturbing my class.

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:43.784
I never liked you.
Now I will never forgive you!

00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:45.421
Fukuroda-sensei!

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:49.787
Fukuroda-sensei,
I understand how you feel.

00:05:49.994 --> 00:05:55.261
But violence is not good. What if
we need to involve the police?

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:59.527
Do not worry.
I am just going to...

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:03.468
...crush his rotten attitude
with my fists of wrath!

00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:05.842
Now, excuse me. Onizuka!

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:08.307
No violence, please! No violence!

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:12.213
Onizuka-sensei!

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:24.055
So you like my kick
from my karate team days.

00:06:24.262 --> 00:06:26.457
Wow! A karate team captain!

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:29.929
-Probably learned it in fights.
-More, more!

00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:33.131
Oh, Fukuroda-sensei. Do you need me?

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:35.862
Well, no....

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:41.308
-I would like to talk to you.
-What?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.443
Listen to me, Onizuka-sensei.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.020
A teacher is supposed to be
a good role model for students.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.280
However, look at you.

00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:58.223
You have way too little awareness
as a teacher.

00:07:00.765 --> 00:07:05.896
He may know karate, but I was
trained physically and emotionally...

00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:11.973
...at Nippori and will teach him
that there is always someone better.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.068
If you lose this swim race,
you must swear...

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.081
...to never do anything
a teacher is not expected to do.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:26.290
Excuse me! What the hell
are you doing?

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:29.858
-Well, I'm eating.
-I can see what you are doing!

00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:32.461
The school lunch is not enough.

00:07:32.663 --> 00:07:38.295
That's not the point! To eat within
30 minutes before you swim...

00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:41.199
...you could die!
Don't you know that?

00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:43.635
Is that so?

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:52.211
Anyway, hurry up and go get changed.

00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:55.577
I ate so much! Now what?

00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:59.186
This is a competition between two men.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.858
Competition? Who?

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.584
Don't you ever listen to others?

00:08:04.862 --> 00:08:10.528
-As I've been saying many times....
-Finely ground. Original blend.

00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:12.532
I wanted to see a fight.

00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:17.174
Even monkeys don't do such a thing
to decide who's the boss.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:21.004
Well, well. If it's boring,
we need to make it fun.

00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:23.077
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah!

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:42.159
The girls are impressed
with my perfect form.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:48.134
But this is far from the essence
of my magnificent swimming technique.

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:52.639
Now look at this butterfly style!

00:08:56.914 --> 00:09:00.145
This is the authentic
butterfly stroke.

00:09:00.384 --> 00:09:03.615
-Look at his waist move!
-I'll have nightmares!

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:06.483
-I'm gonna puke!
-It's gross, but he's fast!

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.556
-I bet on Hokuroda.
-Hokuroda.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:10.056
Teacher Race Totocalcio

00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.253
-Thank you!
-Shimizu also bet on Hokuroda.

00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:17.161
Hey, all bets are on Hokuroda.
There's no gamble.

00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:21.236
What about Onizuka?
What? Where did he go?

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:27.071
-I don't like Hokuroda, but he's fast.
-I'll bet on Hokuroda too.

00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:35.542
Inugami Family.

00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:39.818
I'm drowning.

00:09:44.862 --> 00:09:46.659
Mikako Kotani, gold medalist.

00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:51.467
-Shit! Get serious!
-We wanna make a living out of this!

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:56.729
What? What are you guys doing?
Give me that!

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:03.538
-What are the odds?
-You are about 15 times....

00:10:03.748 --> 00:10:06.239
Hokuroda is the favorite.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.750
Oh, really?
Do you wanna bet too, Fukuroda-sensei?

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.048
-Stupid!
-What are you doing?

00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.925
You think of yourself as a teacher?
Gambling with students!

00:10:18.129 --> 00:10:23.658
It's a joke. A joke!
Or you don't think you can defeat me?

00:10:23.868 --> 00:10:28.567
Fine. Then I'll bet on myself.
Let me see....

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.040
One, two, three....
Wow, you have more than enough!

00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:39.215
I'll bet all my money!

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:51.553
-If Onizuka wins, he'll buy us food.
-Then I don't care if I lose my bet.

00:10:53.097 --> 00:10:57.124
You think you can win in shorts
with so much resistance?

00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:59.529
You just don't understand!

00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:01.796
Get set!

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.871
Ready!

00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:10.079
-Beat Hokuroda!
-Go, Onizuka!

00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:15.878
Who is proud of his stamina?
Don't take me lightly.

00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:26.048
I'm a P.E. teacher. I trained
rigorously for four years...

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:29.843
...at Nippori Sports College.

00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:33.749
Eikichi Onizuka is
not worthy of my fear.

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:37.357
My college nickname was "Wolf Fish. "
He won't win!

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.429
Five more meters!
Four, three, two, one--

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:46.031
He did it!

00:11:48.704 --> 00:11:53.732
You bastard, what did you do? You
cheated, didn't you? You must have!

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:58.673
-He didn't cheat.
-He was swimming. He dove all the way.

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:02.978
Dove? It can't be.

00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:07.519
A smoker like him swam 50 meters
without taking a breath?

00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:11.159
No! That's impossible!

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.797
I know! This is a case of doping!
It can't be anything else!

00:12:15.998 --> 00:12:18.831
Stay there! I'll be right
back, you bastard!

00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.567
It was so awesome, teacher!

00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:25.764
-Fukuroda was really intimidated.
-Justice prevails.

00:12:26.242 --> 00:12:30.440
Look who's talking. You had
no intention of competing.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:34.514
Your wallet is empty.

00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:46.893
You wait, cheater.

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:51.499
If that's your attitude,
I'll use any tactics I choose.

00:12:52.435 --> 00:12:56.201
Don't worry! It will be on me today!

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:05.446
One more try, Onizuka-kun!

00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:10.108
I cannot be beaten by you.

00:13:26.268 --> 00:13:28.236
One more time!

00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:32.229
It'll be the same no matter
how many times you try!

00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:34.773
Shut up! One more time!

00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:39.471
This time. This time I will win!

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:43.243
I will win! I will win!
This time!

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:47.583
It's unreal! I can't believe it!

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:50.850
One more time!

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.324
More?

00:13:53.662 --> 00:13:56.563
I can't let you beat....

00:14:02.037 --> 00:14:05.803
Somehow everyone falls into
Onizuka's pace. How stupid!

00:14:06.008 --> 00:14:09.239
-Miyabi....
-Don't worry. It's taken care of.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.942
Here I am.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.117
I'd better hurry up.
Let's see. This is it!

00:14:21.323 --> 00:14:22.620
Onizuka

00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:41.236
Here I am!

00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:50.982
Ouch!

00:14:52.154 --> 00:14:57.319
Oh, are you all right?
What? Aren't you in my class?

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.289
Tomoko Nomura.

00:14:59.495 --> 00:15:03.659
Class 3-4. Attendance number 27.

00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:05.629
Just call me Tomo-chan!

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:10.970
Okay. Oh, that's right.
Tomoko Nomura.

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:13.903
No wonder you look familiar.

00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:16.600
Here we go.

00:15:17.012 --> 00:15:19.674
Wow, big. What's your size?

00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:23.909
-It's F.
-F! Aren't you still 14?

00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:27.748
I've been drinking a lot of milk
since I was little.

00:15:27.957 --> 00:15:32.451
Then suddenly they became big
when I was a fourth-grader.

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:33.923
Fourth grade.

00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:37.223
Would you like to touch them?
I don't mind.

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:38.764
Don't tease me!

00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:43.302
Oh, I was on my way to see Miyabi.
I almost forgot.

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:45.473
See you later!

00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:48.871
Oh, sure. See you.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.803
Isn't that good?

00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:56.583
-Miyabi-chan!
-Did it go well?

00:15:56.785 --> 00:15:59.982
Yes. Tomo-chan put
all of our underwear...

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:03.750
...in Onizuka-sensei's locker,
just like you told me to.

00:16:03.993 --> 00:16:07.053
-No one was watching you, right?
-Yes!

00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:10.061
Now all we need to do is wait.

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:13.463
Onizuka will be fired
as a panty thief.

00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:16.137
He could even be sent to jail.

00:16:16.338 --> 00:16:18.329
-You're so good.
-And evil.

00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:22.575
Of course. I'll do anything
to destroy Onizuka.

00:16:22.778 --> 00:16:25.110
But I won't dirty my own hands.

00:16:25.314 --> 00:16:28.010
-You mean...?
-Tomoko is the only yogore?

00:16:28.217 --> 00:16:32.950
-What is yogore?
-It's short for "Yoh, go-rippa redi. "

00:16:33.155 --> 00:16:36.716
-Tomo-chan is fine?
-Fine, very fine.

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:38.359
I'm fine!

00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:41.118
She is naturally slow.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.299
That's why your nickname is Toroko.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.095
Maybe your nutrients went to
your boobs, not your brain.

00:16:48.304 --> 00:16:51.102
-That makes sense.
-She's an F cup at 14.

00:16:51.307 --> 00:16:54.299
She'll be dragging
her boobs in high school.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.948
But I don't know if it was okay.
Onizuka-sensei will get in trouble.

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:05.587
Shut up! Just shut your mouth
and do what I tell you to!

00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:08.182
I'm so sorry, Miyabi-chan.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.986
Do you understand? If you tell
on us, you'll be excommunicated.

00:17:13.195 --> 00:17:15.891
Okay, I'll never tell.

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:21.361
Cheer up, Fukuroda-sensei.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.006
I'm finished. I'm no longer....

00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:29.274
What? A panty thief?!

00:17:29.712 --> 00:17:32.476
All the girls in class
are missing underwear.

00:17:32.681 --> 00:17:35.548
It must be someone within the school.

00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:37.412
Please find the thief.

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:42.613
We feel uneasy taking classes
when there's a pervert on our campus.

00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:45.453
But how can we...?

00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:48.027
Leave it to me!

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.721
Let's do a surprise school inspection.

00:17:50.933 --> 00:17:53.629
Then we'll find out
who the criminal is!

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:59.874
But, Fukuroda-sensei, pinpointing someone
as a criminal might damage...

00:18:00.075 --> 00:18:02.805
...our trust with the students.

00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:04.377
That's cowardly!

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.411
Gossip lasts for 75 days.

00:18:06.615 --> 00:18:09.516
If I catch the criminal
for this case...

00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:13.552
...people will forget about
me losing to Onizuka.

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:19.058
I, Hajime Fukuroda,
will catch the criminal.

00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.389
We'll be inspecting
all of your belongings.

00:18:22.598 --> 00:18:26.967
Everyone should show their items
in their lockers, desks and bags.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:31.435
-Hey, what's taking so long?
-They are suspicious of us!

00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:39.146
I'm glad. It doesn't look like
the students are to blame.

00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:44.345
That can't be! We should be able
to find the criminal!

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:48.182
We haven't released anyone
from their classrooms!

00:18:48.857 --> 00:18:52.918
Isn't there a possibility that
a teacher is the criminal?

00:18:53.128 --> 00:18:54.117
What?

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:57.121
Students were all in their classes.

00:18:57.332 --> 00:19:00.961
The ones with no alibi are
teachers who don't have class.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.468
Inspect those lockers too.

00:19:03.672 --> 00:19:05.003
But....

00:19:05.207 --> 00:19:09.166
Begin with Onizuka-sensei's locker,
since he wasn't teaching.

00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:12.775
-No, don't!
-Onizuka-sensei?

00:19:13.615 --> 00:19:17.142
The fact you resist so
intensely makes us wonder...

00:19:17.352 --> 00:19:20.480
...if you are hiding something,
Onizuka-sensei.

00:19:20.689 --> 00:19:26.218
No, no. It's not that
I'm hiding something.

00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:29.795
Fukuroda-sensei!
Open Onizuka-sensei's locker!

00:19:30.032 --> 00:19:32.296
-Yes, sir!
-Why start with me?

00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:35.527
You resist so much,
we're more curious!

00:19:35.737 --> 00:19:38.001
Please don't touch my locker!

00:19:38.207 --> 00:19:40.334
-Move over!
-I don't want to!

00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:42.305
What is that? So pathetic.

00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:47.039
He's fighting it. He might
know about the underwear.

00:19:47.249 --> 00:19:50.776
Even so, he wouldn't know about us.

00:19:50.986 --> 00:19:53.955
Just watch.
When they open his locker...

00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:57.250
...he'll be fired on
the spot, as the thief.

00:19:57.459 --> 00:19:59.791
Stop! It's a privacy violation!

00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:02.225
Quiet! Vice principal, go ahead!

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:04.160
Okay. Here.

00:20:04.366 --> 00:20:06.994
No!

00:20:07.636 --> 00:20:09.228
Go ahead and open it.

00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:14.273
You will be labeled a panty thief
in front of everyone!

00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:20.745
Wow! Underwear!

00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:22.678
What?

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:27.651
It smells!

00:20:27.856 --> 00:20:31.417
-Oh, no. That's why I warned you.
-Dirty!

00:20:31.627 --> 00:20:36.929
Why have you stacked up so much
dirty laundry in your locker?

00:20:37.132 --> 00:20:40.101
Well, it would make my room dirty.

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:45.702
You're such a pig. Don't you
have self-respect as a teacher?

00:20:45.908 --> 00:20:47.842
Listen, Onizuka-sensei!

00:20:48.043 --> 00:20:52.503
Teachers are supposed to be
role models for students!

00:20:52.714 --> 00:20:57.913
A teacher should be extremely
organized like me.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.350
Just like this.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.992
It can't be.
This is some kind of mistake!

00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:08.425
Or it is a bad dream!

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:15.568
Underwear.

00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:18.399
What's wrong, Fukuroda-sensei?

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.706
Oh, nothing.

00:21:25.914 --> 00:21:29.350
Today, a teacher was
arrested for panty theft.

00:21:29.551 --> 00:21:34.887
The suspect is Holy Forest Academy's
P.E. teacher, 32-year-old Fukuroda.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.923
This is the news.
A panty thief....

00:21:38.293 --> 00:21:42.195
I thought he might do it someday.

00:21:52.207 --> 00:21:57.406
Oh, I didn't mean to, but my upper
arm muscles went overboard.

00:21:57.613 --> 00:22:00.946
Now my locker is
completely out of order.

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:03.743
Are you trying to escape?

00:22:03.952 --> 00:22:06.318
What? Why are you staring at me?

00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:09.752
Don't tell me
you are suspicious of me.

00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:14.622
I'm shocked. I, Hajime Fukuroda,
have devoted my entire being...

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.961
...to teaching, a sacred vocation.
I would never steal underwear!

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.771
Teacher!

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.579
Stupid bitch! You put them
in the wrong locker!

00:22:34.783 --> 00:22:37.809
Now our plan went down the drain!

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.389
Miyabi, help me!
I'm going to drown!

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.559
It was my mistake to
ask someone like you!

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.488
Help! Miyabi-chan!

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:51.831
Miyabi, Toroko is going to drown!

00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:55.168
It's not that deep.

00:22:59.074 --> 00:23:04.740
Never talk to me again!
I'm through with you!

00:23:07.082 --> 00:23:11.644
Well, later on, we confirmed
Fukuroda-sensei's alibi...

00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:15.914
...and he was not the bloomer thief.

00:23:16.124 --> 00:23:19.560
But we haven't been able
to find the real suspect.

00:23:19.761 --> 00:23:23.424
We only created student
animosity towards teachers.

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:27.124
Now we need to strive hard
to regain their trust.

00:23:42.099 --> 00:23:46.297
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.537 --> 00:23:51.531
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.742 --> 00:23:56.577
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.814 --> 00:24:02.514
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.753 --> 00:24:06.917
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.692 --> 00:24:12.129
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.897 --> 00:24:17.732
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:22.334
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.574 --> 00:24:33.142
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.718 --> 00:24:43.150
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:43.327 --> 00:24:47.559
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:52.633
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.903 --> 00:24:57.738
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.975 --> 00:25:04.312
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:16.157
Next Episode

00:25:16.294 --> 00:25:18.387
-What?
-You're gonna be an idol!

00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:23.056
-What's worse, she's sitting there.
-Were you selling ice here?

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:26.828
-Miyabi-chan, can I come?
-Trash like you can't come.

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:29.836
Yes. That's the way you pump in air.

00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:35.574
Parari, parari. I'm the
replacement for Chonan Kenji.

00:25:35.846 --> 00:25:39.873
That's right, I'm a cow.
A cow with many boobs.

00:25:40.318 --> 00:25:42.286
Here's your favorite hamburger.

00:25:42.486 --> 00:25:45.580
I'll let you produce.
