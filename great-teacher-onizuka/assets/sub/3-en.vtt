WEBVTT

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.633
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:27.305
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:32.071
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.516
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:44.349
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:49.255
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:54.659
Let's cut loose until
We reach our limit

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:59.697
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.166
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.812
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:13.142
Toward the finish line

00:01:47.228 --> 00:01:51.494
Good morning, vice principal.
Oh, is this your car?

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:56.403
It's a Cresta. A white Cresta.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.197
It was delivered today.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:03.239
This form has such dignity!

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:06.139
The white color,
so pure and untouchable!

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.680
I won't leave you for the rest of
my life. You will always be with me.

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.216
Oh, my Cresta!

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:29.568
Hi! I haven't seen you
in a while, vice principal.

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:32.568
Could you move?
I need to bring my stuff in.

00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:33.874
Your stuff?

00:02:34.108 --> 00:02:36.941
Oh, you are here early, Onizuka-kun.

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:40.045
I'll take you to your room.

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:43.747
What are you talking about,
Principal?

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:46.475
Starting today, Onizuka-kun will--

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.419
--live on campus. That was
the requirement for employment.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.819
What?

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:05.163
-Who is that?
-What is that load of stuff?

00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:08.739
Those stares are annoying me.

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.354
Hey, you. Come over here.

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:22.647
I....

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.789
I'm telling you to come here.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:28.285
Yes, sir.

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.330
Give me a hand.

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:39.197
Both of my hands are full
and I can't pick it up.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.968
Yes, sir.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:43.972
No, not that!

00:03:46.647 --> 00:03:50.139
I don't want anyone
touching this pillow.

00:03:52.653 --> 00:03:55.713
Do you mind taking that to my room?

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.990
Where is my room?

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.898
-Here. This is it.
-This?

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.401
This is just a storage room!

00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:18.075
Isn't it a nice penthouse?

00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:21.281
Don't be late
for the opening ceremony.

00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:29.347
I knew it was too good to be true.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.390
They were gonna hire me
and provide housing.

00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:36.920
I was completely cheated.

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:42.193
What are you doing?

00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:47.136
When I'm so depressed.

00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:52.608
Well, I just wondered
what kind of games you had.

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.581
You like games?

00:04:56.684 --> 00:04:58.675
Well, yes.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.184
Are you into fighting
and shooting stuff?

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:06.450
Yeah, but I like simulation
and RPG games better.

00:05:06.694 --> 00:05:09.026
Then, have you played this?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.489
Oh, Wild Arms.
I have already finished it.

00:05:16.036 --> 00:05:19.005
I beg of you,
honorable deputy officer!

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.772
I have not been able to finish
this game. Please help me!

00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:26.735
That's fine.

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:30.714
Thank you very much!
May I have your name?

00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.646
Noboru Yoshikawa.

00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:37.621
Honorable Yoshikawa!
I beg for your instruction.

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:38.984
CHAIRPERSON'S OFFICE

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:44.061
I don't understand why we need
to welcome him as a faculty member!

00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:47.199
Can't you rethink your decision?

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:51.302
Don't you think you might
have misunderstood him?

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:54.734
Like that incident at the interview.

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.745
He didn't have any choice. He was
trying to save you from those kids.

00:06:01.482 --> 00:06:04.212
At least, that's how
it appeared to me.

00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:07.150
-I don't think....
-I almost forgot.

00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:09.083
Onizuka

00:06:09.323 --> 00:06:13.020
These are the manuscripts
to introduce new teachers.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.820
Anyway, his employment is final.

00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:24.565
So that guy is a faculty member.
What a shame.

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.304
I see.

00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.914
She is so sly!
He will take over that class.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.482
I see.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:41.420
HOLY FOREST ACADEMY

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:44.147
The ceremony will commence.

00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:49.055
All students must convene
in the gym as soon as possible.

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:54.730
So you are going to live on campus?

00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:58.696
Yes. Please come visit me.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:03.639
You can be happy for just
a little while, Eikichi Onizuka.

00:07:06.847 --> 00:07:11.614
Next, I will introduce
our new teachers.

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:14.547
Eikichi Onizuka-sensei.

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:16.546
That guy!

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.884
He will teach social studies
to the middle school...

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:23.528
...and will be the homeroom teacher
for Class 3-4.

00:07:23.764 --> 00:07:25.197
Class 3-4.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:27.699
You mean, the former 2-4!

00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:31.234
I can't believe they're forcing
that on a new teacher.

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.139
Hi. I am Eikichi Onizuka,
22 years old.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:42.941
I will be the homeroom teacher
for middle school, Class 3-4--

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:46.880
Middle school?! I'm in charge
of middle school students?

00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.283
Wait a minute!

00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:54.825
I was told I'd be teaching high school.
I demand an explanation, Xavier!

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.492
Hey, all of you. Be quiet!

00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:07.897
Onizuka-sensei, the microphone!

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:11.737
What? What about the microphone?

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:15.271
-What's with him?
-Dyed hair and pierced ears.

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:18.713
-Is he allowed to be a teacher?
-Could he be fake?

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:23.111
I heard you! You think I'm fake?

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:25.382
I'll show you proof!

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:28.794
This is my teaching certificate!

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:36.628
My teaching certificate!

00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:41.800
It's still good, right? If I use tape,
it will still be valid, right?

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:43.532
Quiet! Quiet!

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:51.214
How much do you want to ridicule me?

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:55.047
You are a teacher! You aren't
even aware you're a teacher!

00:08:55.289 --> 00:08:57.849
What's with your blond hair
and pierced ears?

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:01.356
The thought of someone like you
reporting to me...

00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:03.995
...is unacceptable!

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:09.294
No matter what it takes,
I will kick you out of this school!

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:20.641
Onizuka-kun, don't be discouraged.

00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:24.749
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.515
What did you say?

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.354
Weren't you listening
to the vice principal?

00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:38.622
Teachers' preachings all sound...

00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:40.663
...pretty much the same.

00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:45.361
I am shocked about not
being a high school teacher.

00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:49.835
My plan was to be surrounded
by high school girls.

00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:52.841
My life was going to be so rosy.

00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:57.044
But I'm in charge of
immature middle school kids.

00:09:57.284 --> 00:10:00.117
I heard a little earlier...

00:10:00.354 --> 00:10:04.051
...that your homeroom, Class 3-4....

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.217
Rumor says it is the worst,
most problematic class...

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:10.225
...in this school's history.

00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:15.700
What kind of problems can
middle school students cause?

00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:18.137
Something like this?

00:10:18.372 --> 00:10:19.634
Or this.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.140
Or, at most, this.

00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:25.242
I really don't know much about it.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:30.348
Leave it to me!
I'm used to that kind of stuff.

00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:36.786
If you take control at the beginning,
the rest is easy!

00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:39.788
I guess I'll go impress them!

00:10:41.995 --> 00:10:44.793
The worst class
in this school's history.

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:48.325
Interesting. Very interesting!

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:52.699
If they act that way, I have
my own way of dealing with it.

00:11:06.954 --> 00:11:11.015
Starting today, I will be your teacher.
I'm Great Teacher Onizuka.

00:11:11.258 --> 00:11:13.522
Thank you for cooperating!

00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:24.264
Teacher, it's smoky.

00:11:24.504 --> 00:11:25.869
Sorry, sorry.

00:11:26.807 --> 00:11:30.573
Teacher, please put the cigarette butt
in the ashtray.

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:35.439
Teacher, please take attendance.

00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:40.479
Is this the right class?

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:42.819
Akiyama.

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.250
Aizawa.

00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:45.719
Asano.

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:47.085
Iijima.

00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:49.022
Izumi.

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:52.890
It's you! The game kid, Yoshioka!

00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:55.897
I didn't know you were in this class.

00:11:56.136 --> 00:12:00.766
Let's have fun, Yoshimura.
No, was it Yoshihara?

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:06.503
Yoshida! Yoshinaga!
I got it, it's Yoshikawa!

00:12:07.014 --> 00:12:10.108
You are the god of games,
Yoshikawa-kun!

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.046
Give me a lesson after school.

00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:14.480
Ogaki.

00:12:14.988 --> 00:12:16.250
Oshima.

00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:42.441
To celebrate a new school year, we are
gathered here under a cherry tree.

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:45.877
So, Onizuka-sensei, how was your class?

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.582
They were kind of quiet.
It was a letdown.

00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:57.057
I've just found out about the former
homeroom teacher of that class.

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:00.291
Her name is Kazumi Kahara.

00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:04.738
Wow! She is really pretty!
Where is she now?

00:13:05.674 --> 00:13:07.608
In a hospital.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.601
This is the picture of her...now.

00:13:10.846 --> 00:13:12.871
What is this?

00:13:13.115 --> 00:13:15.174
Bulimia caused by stress.

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:18.682
Gosh, what a waste!
She was so pretty.

00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:21.321
Even before Ms. Kahara...

00:13:21.557 --> 00:13:25.323
...two teachers who were
in charge of that class resigned...

00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:28.655
...due to psychological stress.

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:33.292
Onizuka-sensei, please be careful.

00:13:33.535 --> 00:13:36.595
-It won't do any good to worry.
-Cheers!

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:40.103
What? We haven't toasted yet.

00:13:40.342 --> 00:13:42.469
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:47.045
The vice principal always talks a long
time. Here. I'm Sannomaru.

00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:49.547
Thank you. I'm Onizuka.

00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:53.512
Cheers.

00:13:56.158 --> 00:14:01.425
At least I have my bed secured.
I will do the rest little by little.

00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:04.599
I'm going to bed now.

00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:14.636
I never imagined
I would be living on campus.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.869
I wonder what
that chairwoman is up to.

00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:24.981
So quiet. School at night....

00:14:28.324 --> 00:14:32.226
Shit! I should have been brave enough
to invite Fuyutsuki over!

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:38.095
Onizuka-kun,
I've never done it before.

00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:40.359
Please be gentle.

00:14:40.602 --> 00:14:42.331
You too.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.532
Azusa!

00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:52.842
What? I guess
I'm just hearing things.

00:14:53.082 --> 00:14:58.110
Anyway, I'm the only one
here in the school building.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.350
Am I just hearing things?

00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:07.055
What was it?

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.357
A school building at night
means horror stories!

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.865
I wonder if what appears
in this school is....

00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:25.539
I wonder if the problems surrounding
Class 3-4 are ghosts or something.

00:15:26.982 --> 00:15:30.349
Don't tell me
that chairwoman hired me...

00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:34.044
...as a potential ghostbuster.

00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:45.792
Don't mock me, you ghosts.

00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:49.368
The Honorable Eikichi Onizuka
will not be scared!

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.916
This is Great Teacher Onizuka.

00:16:04.153 --> 00:16:08.613
I've come to bust you guys.
Bad spirits!

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:20.259
Hey, wait! Wait!

00:16:23.272 --> 00:16:25.331
My treasure!

00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:29.139
An underwear thief!

00:16:37.386 --> 00:16:40.184
You scared me.

00:16:45.894 --> 00:16:48.294
What would I do if someone saw us?

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.057
Who would come to a locker room
in a school at night?

00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:54.769
It's just us.

00:16:55.003 --> 00:16:57.335
You are probably right. Stop!

00:16:58.574 --> 00:17:02.135
Don't flash the light underneath.
You'll see inside.

00:17:02.377 --> 00:17:04.242
Come on.

00:17:07.249 --> 00:17:09.740
-Someone is there!
-Who's there?

00:17:11.653 --> 00:17:13.712
I'm just a teacher.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.691
You are so rude to show up
at such a place.

00:17:18.093 --> 00:17:20.220
Excuse me.

00:17:20.462 --> 00:17:22.794
See you!

00:17:26.702 --> 00:17:30.035
So late at night. Cool off.

00:17:34.209 --> 00:17:37.269
Ghosts are such dumb things.

00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:41.409
Don't forget to shut it.

00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:47.618
Goodbye

00:17:47.856 --> 00:17:50.222
"Goodbye."

00:17:52.327 --> 00:17:54.818
Blood!? It can't be!

00:17:55.931 --> 00:17:59.458
It's open. Didn't I shut it?
I'm sure I did.

00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:13.906
There it is! There it is!

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:15.912
Teacher....

00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:17.743
Teacher?

00:18:18.353 --> 00:18:19.650
Yoshikawa!

00:18:19.888 --> 00:18:23.289
Is that you?
What are you doing there?

00:18:23.525 --> 00:18:25.220
Don't come any closer!

00:18:25.761 --> 00:18:29.197
I can't....
I can't stand it anymore.

00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:31.262
Moron

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.663
I'm going to kill myself.

00:18:34.903 --> 00:18:38.703
Don't be a fool!
Don't rush into it! It will hurt!

00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.877
Your guts and brain would
splatter everywhere!

00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:46.080
-My brain?
-Yep! Your brain, splatter!

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:49.045
If you don't want that,
stay right there.

00:18:49.851 --> 00:18:52.081
Good. You are doing great.

00:18:53.922 --> 00:18:58.450
I love you, I love you, I love you.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.987
My dear Cresta.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.859
I'm so sorry.
I can't drive you home tonight.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.933
I had too much to drink.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.900
But starting tomorrow
we will be together.

00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:13.164
Don't do it, Yoshikawa!

00:19:13.642 --> 00:19:16.202
Good. Stay still. Stay still.

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:42.101
That hurt. Hey, are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:43.964
Hey, Yoshikawa!

00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:50.605
This might be a little too big
for you. But wear these home.

00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:55.075
If you get beat up,
you should beat them up!

00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:58.548
Who did this to you?
Someone in our class?

00:19:59.087 --> 00:20:04.491
I can't say. If I tell you,
I'll get beaten even worse.

00:20:04.726 --> 00:20:07.490
If people find out
I got beaten up by a girl--

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:09.457
A girl?

00:20:10.065 --> 00:20:13.523
See? You think it is dumb too.

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:16.431
How do you think
I can tell my parents?

00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:29.247
Wow, it's a nice-looking house.
Where is your room?

00:20:29.818 --> 00:20:31.615
That window on the third floor.

00:20:31.853 --> 00:20:34.754
-Do you have any siblings?
-No.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.957
Good.

00:20:39.995 --> 00:20:41.622
It's locked.

00:20:46.268 --> 00:20:50.466
What are you doing? Come up.
Do you want your parents to find out?

00:20:54.276 --> 00:20:56.369
So this is your room.

00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:04.850
Wow, what an amazing collection
of games! Is this all yours?

00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:10.051
Nothing else to do.

00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:15.286
I don't have friends.
What are you doing?

00:21:17.099 --> 00:21:22.366
-I will give it back to you at school.
-It's okay. You can borrow it.

00:21:22.604 --> 00:21:27.234
What? Are you sure? Hurray!
Then, this and this and this....

00:21:28.443 --> 00:21:32.243
What made you decide to be a teacher?

00:21:32.748 --> 00:21:34.978
I wonder what it was....

00:21:36.084 --> 00:21:41.488
-You became a teacher for no reason?
-Hey, shut up! Why do you care?

00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:46.319
If I have to have a reason....
I thought it would be fun.

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:49.663
Fun? School?

00:21:50.065 --> 00:21:54.229
If students bring porn magazines,
I can confiscate them.

00:21:54.469 --> 00:21:56.369
I can go on school trips.

00:21:56.605 --> 00:22:00.701
Then there are plenty of summer
and winter vacations.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.376
Well, it's how you look at it.

00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:08.606
Even this window, it has become
a secret loophole with a trick.

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:14.788
I'm gonna get going. You come up
with a good excuse for this.

00:22:16.191 --> 00:22:19.024
-Thanks.
-Sure.

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:26.763
Can I come visit you in your room?

00:22:27.002 --> 00:22:29.971
Come anytime.
Come to my secret base.

00:22:30.972 --> 00:22:34.908
Secret base? Do you think
you're a superhero or something?

00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:37.845
I'm a defender of justice.

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:39.376
Justice

00:22:40.348 --> 00:22:45.547
Hey, teacher.
Will school become fun for me too?

00:22:45.787 --> 00:22:48.483
Sure, it will.

00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:53.588
I will make school
interesting for you.

00:23:07.175 --> 00:23:10.110
I heard that teacher, Onizuka...

00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:13.337
...saved a student
from committing suicide.

00:23:13.582 --> 00:23:17.575
Poor vice principal.
It was delivered only yesterday.

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:19.582
Vice principal!

00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:21.787
This is....

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:46.153
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.427 --> 00:23:51.364
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:56.433
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.703 --> 00:24:02.369
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:06.773
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:11.984
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:17.587
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:22.189
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.464 --> 00:24:32.998
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.607 --> 00:24:42.948
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:43.183 --> 00:24:47.415
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:52.523
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:57.594
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:04.202
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:17.175
PREVIEW

00:25:17.417 --> 00:25:18.384
What is this?!

00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:26.157
I must expel him from this school!

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.858
Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard!

00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:33.831
What a pervert, Onizuka!

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:38.094
I didn't think you liked
this kind of thing!

00:25:40.374 --> 00:25:45.471
I will get revenge for this.
