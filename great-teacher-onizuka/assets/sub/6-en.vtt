WEBVTT

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.099
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:27.369
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:32.480
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:38.219
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:43.991
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:48.961
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.036
Let's cut loose until
We reach our limit

00:00:55.306 --> 00:01:00.835
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:04.503
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.173
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:13.388
Toward the finish line

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.865
You want to file another claim
because your car was damaged again?

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:50.267
Don't you think you're asking
for too much, Uchiyamada-san?

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:55.241
-This is the second car.
-I know, but please help me!

00:01:55.512 --> 00:02:00.074
Let me tell you this.
To total two cars in two weeks...

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:02.649
...it could be considered fraud!

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:07.085
Please! An important family trip
is coming up this weekend!

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.622
To regain my dignity as a father
and for our family unity...

00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:16.697
...I absolutely need to have
the Cresta! I beg of you!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.731
I don't know....

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:37.578
It's him! He is the source
of all my bad luck!

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:41.155
He is the god of plagues,
the god of poverty.

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:44.156
He will definitely be fired this time!

00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:46.158
Chairman's office

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:49.323
Chairman! Onizuka should--!

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.629
-Onizuka should be fired right away!
-Right. What?

00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:58.331
To expose my daughter's underwear
and to take a picture of her!

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:02.308
We cannot have such
a shameless, disgraceful teacher!

00:03:02.512 --> 00:03:06.778
Not just as a parent, but also
as the president of the PTA...

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:10.578
...I cannot allow such a teacher
to roam around!

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:15.349
Unfortunately, the chairman is not
in the office right now...

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.153
...and I cannot decide this myself.

00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:20.192
Then bring them here!

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:24.663
The chairman and the pervert
named Onizuka. Right now!

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:30.265
Chairman, I'm sure
he had a good reason.

00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:35.274
Even so, he antagonized
the wrong person. What shall we do?

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:38.845
Anyway, I'll go check on Onizuka-sensei.

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:43.013
Onizuka-kun has created such a mess.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.247
I can't believe he made an enemy
out of the PTA president.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.123
Onizuka-sensei!

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.489
What's wrong?
You look so serious.

00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.465
Do you wanna confess
your love for me?

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.731
That's so dumb!
Uehara's mother just arrived.

00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:09.435
Didn't you know? Her mother is
the president of the PTA.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.779
You can't be a teacher if you're
afraid of the PTA. I'll show them!

00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.453
Teacher for life!

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.622
Isn't your arm too big?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.256
Of course! I do 1000 pushups.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:27.954
Then after that, 5000 pull-ups
and 10,000 Hindu squats every day.

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:32.560
But still, just your right arm
is strangely....

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.668
What? It's huge!
When did this happen?

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:40.434
This swelling is abnormal.
It could be broken.

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:45.348
What? Oh, no. It's fine.

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:50.311
See? I can do pushups. But I can't
tell where my right hand is.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.254
It's not fine. You are
no longer in pain but numb.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:57.517
Chairman's office

00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:02.027
As you may already know,
I am also an education critic...

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:05.690
...and I am against teachers
using corporal punishment.

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:09.668
I absolutely cannot
overlook this incident.

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:14.438
Handle this properly or I will
resort to extreme measures.

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:19.343
I understand your feelings, but I
need to talk to Onizuka-sensei first.

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:22.551
How can you take it so lightly?

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:25.050
Excuse me, chairman.

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:31.116
Onizuka-sensei was hospitalized earlier.

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:34.889
Is that so? Then there is
nothing we can do now.

00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:39.228
We'll hear his side
of the story later.

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:42.496
No, it's not necessary.

00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:46.665
Tomorrow, I'm calling
an emergency PTA meeting.

00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:52.711
In the meeting I will propose that
Onizuka-sensei be fired immediately!

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:55.248
Now, excuse me.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.493
Thanks to you, Fuyutsuki-sensei,
we don't have to deal with her today.

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:09.097
What a good excuse you came up with,
Onizuka in the hospital.

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:15.267
-It's true. He broke his arm.
-What?

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:22.736
Fired. Onizuka will be fired.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:27.576
Finally, the public has started
to take actions to destroy him.

00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:31.185
With so much pressure from the PTA...

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:34.186
... not even the chairman
can protect him.

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:39.254
This will completely end
his career as a teacher.

00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:50.863
It serves him right. He's gonna pay
dearly for making my mom mad.

00:06:51.074 --> 00:06:53.474
But I wonder why Onizuka...

00:06:53.676 --> 00:06:58.511
...would take a picture
exposing your underwear?

00:07:01.284 --> 00:07:05.846
There's no question. Onizuka is
a pervert with a Lolita complex.

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:10.550
-His brain is like a middle-aged man's.
-That's right!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.920
Anyway, Onizuka will
definitely be fired.

00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:16.530
That's for sure.

00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:26.234
Is it true, vice principal? The rumor
about Onizuka-sensei's dismissal?

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.535
At the PTA meeting tomorrow...

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:33.477
...I'm pretty sure
the decision will be made.

00:07:33.683 --> 00:07:38.882
He is not cut out to be
a teacher to begin with.

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:41.683
So finally the time has come.

00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:47.561
If Mr. Onizuka is up against
the PTA president, he has no chance.

00:07:47.764 --> 00:07:52.724
By the way, Onizuka-sensei
doesn't seem to be in today.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.334
He's in the hospital
with a broken bone. Sure!

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:00.100
I know he faked it to get away!

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:06.476
I could tell what kind of guy he was
even when I interviewed him.

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:18.126
What shall I do, Kikuchi?
Onizuka-sensei will be fired.

00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:21.229
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:25.223
Even if you or Class 3-4
weren't involved...

00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:30.338
...it would have happened anyway.
He shouldn't be a teacher.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.235
Holy Forest Academy

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:36.640
He would still have been fired
for his recklessness.

00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:44.985
I knew he was stupid and perverted...

00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:50.319
...but I never thought he'd mess
with the PTA president's daughter.

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:55.692
We don't have time to be laughing.
He's on the verge of being fired.

00:08:55.932 --> 00:09:01.802
Hard to believe. Even when he took on
100 rival gang members by himself...

00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:04.565
...he didn't even get one scratch.

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:08.403
Now his arm's broken.
I wonder what he did.

00:09:12.248 --> 00:09:14.079
You're locking the door?

00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:17.281
He is supposed to have bed rest...

00:09:17.487 --> 00:09:22.015
...but he keeps getting up
and bothering us.

00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:23.692
We have no choice.

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:28.489
I don't know what he's thinking
at such a crucial time.

00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:31.195
Onizuka-san--

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.203
Onizuka-san!

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:39.808
-He escaped.
-We're on the fourth floor!

00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:44.747
In the end, Onizuka
wasn't such a big deal.

00:09:45.315 --> 00:09:49.684
I don't think any teacher can be
a match for us, Class 3-4.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.313
That bastard will be hung
at the PTA meeting tomorrow.

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:58.153
I can't wait. Be gone, Onizuka!

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:09.063
Serves him right!
Now for the next one.

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:12.274
Jyuken 3
Fist of Beasts

00:10:12.475 --> 00:10:13.703
What's wrong?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.037
Challenger Wanted

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:22.108
You idiot!

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:42.394
All right! I'm gonna beat you! Here!

00:11:08.364 --> 00:11:11.333
-Give me more money.
-Don't play anymore.

00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:14.697
Shut up! Hurry up and give me money!

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:21.343
Shit! What's wrong with this game?
I've had it! It's so stupid!

00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:23.068
You're so lame!

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.337
Challenger Wanted

00:11:24.547 --> 00:11:28.916
-You're blaming the machine.
-Onizuka!

00:11:29.352 --> 00:11:33.686
You should have gone home
to suck on your mommy's boob.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.859
Why are you wasting
your time in a game center?

00:11:37.293 --> 00:11:39.818
Look who's talking!

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:44.600
Watch your mouth.
I'm playing mindfully!

00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.134
By the way, you lose too easily.

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:53.332
The way you play, it's like
throwing money in the sewer.

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:56.978
But thanks to lousy players
like you...

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.377
...I get to play those games
for only 100 yen.

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:03.143
Your time will be up soon.

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:08.853
You'll be fired tomorrow!
Do you understand, you bastard?

00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:12.622
I'll tell you. Being a teacher
is so much fun...

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:18.768
...I'll never quit, no matter
what anyone says. See you!

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:25.006
Please, Mommy.
You're the only one I can count on.

00:12:27.677 --> 00:12:29.941
My mom is totally mad.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.880
She said she would even make
a big deal about Onizuka on TV.

00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:39.953
-Now Onizuka's gonna be ousted.
-So, what do we do with Yoshikawa?

00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:43.455
After things calm down,
we'll beat him up again.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:50.026
We need to make sure he understands
who he's messing with.

00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:00.599
There is absolutely
no room for excuses!

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.643
Should such a pervert
teach in our school?

00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:08.848
He is trash. He is useless!
He should be removed at once!

00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:14.786
Onizuka. The devil who
demolished my Cresta twice.

00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:18.757
Farewell to you as of today. Finally!

00:13:18.995 --> 00:13:22.021
A 14-year-old is still a kid.

00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:26.531
On top of that, a girl
that age is so sensitive.

00:13:26.736 --> 00:13:28.863
My gentle, obedient daughter...

00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:35.170
...was hurt physically and emotionally
by him, more than I can describe.

00:13:38.848 --> 00:13:42.284
What a pathetic teacher.

00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:50.917
Not only as a parent, but also
as an education critic...

00:13:51.127 --> 00:13:54.528
...I will expose this incident
and pursue it!

00:13:55.131 --> 00:13:56.996
Chairman....

00:13:57.767 --> 00:14:03.728
I demand his immediate dismissal!
Fire him! He deserves nothing less!

00:14:26.529 --> 00:14:28.997
Repentance

00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:30.721
Onizuka?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.795
He's the one! The perverted teacher!

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.707
You are Onizuka?
What are you doing here?

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.073
Don't you get it?
Oh, I can't believe it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.114
If I explain this gag,
it won't be funny anymore.

00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:53.250
Gag? Do you understand what
kind of situation you are in?

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:56.550
It's not a matter
of being funny or not!

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:58.886
It is a matter of being funny.

00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:04.362
It's my job to make school fun.
Eikichi Onizuka! Nice to meet you!

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:05.761
Nyce ta meet ya

00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:10.735
All of you can conclude
from what you just saw...

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.172
...whether Onizuka is suited
to be a teacher or not.

00:15:15.812 --> 00:15:19.179
Let's take a vote whether
to dismiss him or not.

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:20.644
Wait!

00:15:21.284 --> 00:15:25.880
I don't know how to be the PTA
president. Accept my challenge!

00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:28.283
What will you do?

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:34.392
If you beat me in this game,
I will graciously quit my job.

00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:39.000
If I win, let's forget everything
you're discussing today.

00:15:39.535 --> 00:15:42.663
I've never lost in this game.

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:47.638
-You can start anytime you like.
-It's absolutely stupid!

00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:50.969
What are you doing?

00:15:54.617 --> 00:15:58.018
Who is in favor of
immediate dismissal?

00:16:14.637 --> 00:16:16.070
Wait!

00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:21.009
Ouch! Time out!
I hit my right arm again.

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.348
Then we unanimously agree
on his immediate dismissal.

00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:35.081
Who is it?
No students are allowed here.

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.224
Yoshikawa.

00:16:37.426 --> 00:16:42.523
We are discussing something important
right now. Return to your class.

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:58.507
What are you doing? What is it?
Something is wrong with him!

00:17:02.418 --> 00:17:05.012
If you are going
to fire Onizuka-sensei...

00:17:05.221 --> 00:17:08.713
...do so after looking at my body.

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:13.290
What are you saying?
Why do I need to see your...?

00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:15.396
Look at those bruises!

00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:24.530
I was bullied by Anko Uehara.
She is right there.

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:30.712
It's been going on for a while.
This time, Anko and her friends...

00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:36.613
...beat me because I was
hanging out with Onizuka-sensei.

00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:40.980
Because of their bullying,
I tried to kill myself.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.988
But Onizuka-sensei saved me.

00:17:48.597 --> 00:17:54.263
I see. Onizuka-sensei broke his arm
when he saved Yoshikawa.

00:17:54.904 --> 00:17:57.998
Sensei did what he did
to Uehara-san...

00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:00.641
...because he saw
the pictures of me...

00:18:00.843 --> 00:18:05.746
...and tried to stop them from
bullying me any further. So--

00:18:06.015 --> 00:18:10.543
Don't make things up! How could
my Anko be engaged in bullying?

00:18:10.753 --> 00:18:14.450
-Do you have any proof?
-What about this?

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:16.147
I'm a homo

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:20.592
Wouldn't a mother recognize
her daughter's handwriting?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.236
-Teacher....
-Thank you, Yoshikawa.

00:18:29.438 --> 00:18:33.534
How long are you to stay stripped?
Put your pants on.

00:18:33.743 --> 00:18:37.736
Don't cry. It's not like
you've been violated.

00:18:38.514 --> 00:18:41.881
Everyone, please be quiet.
Even if bullying was involved...

00:18:42.084 --> 00:18:44.848
...my daughter is not a part of it.

00:18:45.054 --> 00:18:49.252
This is an unforgivable insult
to me as an education critic.

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:54.091
-Mom.
-I'm sure he scribbled it himself.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:59.632
Unless there is concrete evidence,
I demand for his immediate dismissal!

00:18:59.969 --> 00:19:02.802
That's right! Absolutely!

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.735
How are you going to teach him
a lesson this time?

00:19:09.945 --> 00:19:13.005
You'll see. This time...

00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:17.584
...it will be more than
taking his nude pictures.

00:19:17.787 --> 00:19:23.419
It's hard to believe that
your parent is the PTA president.

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:26.184
Especially when you are so dirty.

00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:30.331
No problem. I'm such
a perfect girl at home.

00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:36.233
My mom is an education critic and
appears on TV, acting so important.

00:19:36.439 --> 00:19:38.771
But she'll do anything I ask.

00:19:38.974 --> 00:19:43.001
She is so lenient with me,
it's almost laughable!

00:19:43.479 --> 00:19:48.007
I can do anything from bullying
to torturing teachers.

00:19:48.217 --> 00:19:50.879
My mom will put out the fire.

00:19:51.087 --> 00:19:53.988
You have a great mother!

00:19:54.190 --> 00:20:00.220
Stop! Stop it! Someone, quick!

00:20:02.364 --> 00:20:05.424
What is this, Anko?
It's not true, right?

00:20:05.634 --> 00:20:11.231
It can't be true. My daughter
would never bully anyone.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.275
I'm her mother and I know her best!

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:18.174
Right, Anko?

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.544
Let go of me.
I'm so fed up with you, Mom!

00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:24.616
What are you saying?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.347
Don't make me laugh.
You think you know everything.

00:20:28.557 --> 00:20:33.927
-You don't even know your daughter!
-Anko....

00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:38.562
Watching you act that way
really irritates me.

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:43.397
That's why I wanted to bully someone!
It's all your fault.

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:49.335
You sound ridiculous. You are just
not yourself today. Come with me.

00:20:49.545 --> 00:20:52.241
I don't want to!

00:20:52.448 --> 00:20:55.781
Don't blame it on your parent.

00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:58.914
Don't be a baby!

00:20:59.622 --> 00:21:04.025
Instead, open your eyes wide.

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:10.131
You'll probably find something
more fun than bullying.

00:21:12.535 --> 00:21:14.264
Anko....

00:21:29.552 --> 00:21:32.817
I was right. I thought it was you.

00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:36.856
You are a genius with
this kind of technique.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:40.392
Half of the tape was composite.

00:21:40.596 --> 00:21:43.793
Thank you for what you did
for Onizuka-sensei.

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:47.594
-Don't misunderstand me.
-What?

00:21:47.803 --> 00:21:52.399
It was Yoshikawa's idea.
He said he wanted to help Onizuka.

00:21:53.742 --> 00:21:59.408
I won't like it. I don't want
Onizuka-sensei to leave, no matter what.

00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:05.451
You may say so, but there are lots
of teachers who can replace him.

00:22:05.654 --> 00:22:11.524
There might be a replacement teacher,
but not a replacement friend.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.602
Kikuchi-kun--

00:22:25.808 --> 00:22:32.145
I'm just curious what blunders
Onizuka is gonna commit.

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:41.352
The PTA president, Uehara-san,
called and told me...

00:22:41.557 --> 00:22:45.152
...she was withdrawing
her demand for the dismissal.

00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:50.421
As for Anko Uehara and
her friends, she asked Onizuka-sensei...

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:56.128
...their homeroom teacher,
to discipline them strictly. Okay?

00:22:56.705 --> 00:23:01.301
-Yes, ma'am.
-It was so close. Shit!

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.809
What a tenacious bastard,
that Onizuka!

00:23:06.348 --> 00:23:09.545
You weren't fired,
but you can't teach tomorrow?

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:12.852
But, I'm injured.

00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:16.684
I'll enjoy my paid sick days
for a while.

00:23:16.892 --> 00:23:22.194
There is no way I can quit
such a great job. Right?

00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:28.769
I'm flabbergasted!

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:45.877
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.117 --> 00:23:51.111
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.322 --> 00:23:56.157
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.394 --> 00:24:02.094
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:06.497
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:11.708
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:17.311
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.682 --> 00:24:21.914
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.154 --> 00:24:32.722
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.297 --> 00:24:42.695
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:47.139
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.378 --> 00:24:52.213
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:57.318
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.555 --> 00:25:03.892
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:16.070
Next Episode

00:25:16.274 --> 00:25:22.372
Mom! Where in the world are you
going in such an outfit?

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:24.307
On a date.

00:25:24.515 --> 00:25:27.313
Hello there!
This is a home visit.

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:34.184
Hey, Onizuka!

00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:38.217
If you wanna date my mom,
you need to beat me.

00:25:40.097 --> 00:25:45.626
When did you start
thinking like a loser?
