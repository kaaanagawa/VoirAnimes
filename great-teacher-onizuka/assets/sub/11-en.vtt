WEBVTT

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:21.306
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:27.618
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:32.290
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:38.425
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:44.198
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.169
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:55.244
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.547 --> 00:01:01.042
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.179
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.383
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.596
Toward the finish line

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:40.266
Miss Inogashira Pageant
Open to the Public

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.268
Musashino Public Hall

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:46.273
Thank you for coming.
Fuji TV presents an open audition...

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:51.210
...for the Inogashira Park image girl,
Miss Inogashira. It's about to begin.

00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:04.022
Sorry. Hey, is everyone here?
Akiyama, Asano, Iijima--

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:07.288
-Don't call roll here.
-You're right.

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.193
What is he thinking?

00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:13.427
Now we'll witness the moment
when Tomoko Nomura becomes a star...

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:16.003
...and study how society works.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.141
Don't forget to cheer for her!
And Aizawa too.

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:22.676
Hi, everyone. Good to see you.

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:26.008
Hey, teacher, is it really gonna work?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.583
Making Toroko a star?

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:32.145
Hey, are you listening?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.090
Hey, stop eating snacks and sweets.

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:36.854
What's wrong?

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.690
Number 18 got lost between
the greenroom and here.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:43.332
Look for her! Hurry up!

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.573
Wow, it starts off with a mishap!
It may be a stormy contest this year.

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.702
I got lost.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:59.146
Wow, there are so many people here!

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.187
Miyabi-chan, I know you can win,
because today you're--

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:08.415
Don't talk to me.
I told you I cut you off.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.924
-Sorry.
-Has number 18 shown up?

00:03:12.163 --> 00:03:15.257
Isn't that you?
You're number 18, aren't you?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.195
She's not here.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.366
It's me! I'm here!

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.597
Get in line.
Everyone, when I give you a signal...

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:26.777
...proceed onto the stage
in a single line.

00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:34.414
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Here are the girls.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:37.086
Please come in.

00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:46.552
Number 12, Motoko Ohashi.
Nice to be here.

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:48.788
Self-promotion, please.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:53.094
Let's see....
My measurements are 84-55-85.

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:56.170
And my height is 158.

00:03:56.407 --> 00:04:00.741
My skills are karaoke and piano.
And I like stickers very much.

00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:05.074
-Isn't the competition fierce?
-I wonder where she goes to school.

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:09.878
Don't worry. With Nomura's face
and nice body, she will win easily.

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.716
Dummy! They require a self-promotion,
a song and other stuff.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.654
That Toroko can never do
those things right.

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:21.331
If one's face is all that counts,
my mom would be a big star by now.

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:24.660
-Well, it's just an example.
-It's Aizawa's turn.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.570
Number 13, Miyabi Aizawa.
Thank you for your consideration.

00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:31.303
Wow, we have a very beautiful girl!

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.305
Wow, Miyabi is pretty!

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:36.741
When she's lit like that,
she looks like a star.

00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:40.283
My skills are singing, acting
and playing the piano.

00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:46.479
I haven't decided what I want to be,
but I want to contribute to society...

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.954
...and help people in need.

00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:51.855
-I can't believe what she's saying.
-That bitch.

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:56.396
-She's ahead of the game.
-That's why I'm afraid of girls.

00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.302
You make too much noise!

00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:04.338
Could you go get me some juice?
This snack is too salty.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.811
Shit!

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:13.574
Why do I need to act
like his apprentice? Here.

00:05:13.818 --> 00:05:16.810
-Excuse me, young fellow.
-What? Change?

00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:19.488
That's 150 yen. You're 30 yen short.

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:21.453
That bastard!

00:05:23.027 --> 00:05:24.722
Here it is.

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:26.920
What took you so long?

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:30.163
Because I was shaking the bottle!

00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:33.837
Tomoko is next. Murai-chan.

00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:37.268
I thought so. You're too young
to play a trick on me.

00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:41.308
There's Tomoko! Oh, I need you
to do me one more favor.

00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:50.181
Num...num...number 18!
Nom....

00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:55.916
-You're Tomoko Nomura, right?
-Yes.

00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.660
What is that?

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:02.332
Calm down. Your P.E. class uniform
is great and crazy...

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:05.899
...but the first round is
a swimsuit competition.

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.836
I'm getting really embarrassed.

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:12.941
Oh, no. I goofed.
I will change right away!

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:18.410
Wow. Hey, you! Right here?

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:21.980
Wow, P.E. uniform swimsuit!

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.882
That's crazy!
No, it's very refreshing.

00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:28.717
What's wrong?

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:32.417
Wow. Another big mishap!

00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:35.192
A field trip?

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.597
What is he thinking, changing
the schedule without permission?

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:43.364
Where did they go?
The Capitol or the science museum?

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:46.303
A teacher like him is ridiculous!

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:50.002
I heard something
about a beauty contest.

00:06:50.247 --> 00:06:52.477
I'm asking you where they went!

00:06:52.717 --> 00:06:56.278
A beauty contest?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.318
What the hell is he thinking?

00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:04.893
He canceled his class and he's
teaching them about beautiful girls?

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.724
Fire him. Fire him.
He's fired! He's fired!

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:13.632
That girl has a serious wedgie.

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:17.398
Hey, teacher, Toroko is next.
Is she gonna be okay?

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:22.368
Unlike Miyabi who can sing well,
Toroko can't do anything right.

00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:26.608
You just don't understand
how slow she is.

00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:31.550
A miracle will happen
if my judgment was correct.

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:34.257
Miss Inogashira Pageant Open Audition
Sponsored by Fuji Television

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:36.858
Number 18, Tomoko Nomura.
I'm gonna sing.

00:07:37.094 --> 00:07:38.959
One, two, three. Go!

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:44.293
Ah, Ee, Oo, Eh, Oh!

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:47.333
Ah, in a panicking ahiru

00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.404
Ee, in a mischievous iruka

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:53.405
Oo, in a fallen usagi

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:56.306
Eh, in encho sensei

00:07:56.547 --> 00:07:59.880
I knew he didn't know
what he was doing.

00:08:00.117 --> 00:08:01.982
What kind of moron is she?

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:05.120
-It's like a kid's show.
-She is too much!

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.086
Is she off her rocker?

00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:10.020
The last round is acting.

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:15.062
We'll take a 30-minute break.
Memorize your lines during the break.

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:22.734
-How's it going?
-So-so.

00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:27.774
You're pretty cool.
The other contestants are trashy.

00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:32.449
The level of the competition is low.
You seem like you could win.

00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:35.846
I'm not interested.
I was invited to compete.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:41.285
You just might take the trophy.
Or do you have insurance or something?

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:43.755
Like a deal with a production company.

00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:46.956
I'm an amateur.
I have nothing to do with that.

00:08:47.198 --> 00:08:50.167
If you're an amateur,
you wouldn't win.

00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:52.926
Like I said, I don't care
if I win or not!

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.730
Then why did you participate in this?

00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:58.237
-I told you, I was asked!
-Miyabi-chan.

00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.614
If you don't wanna talk, that's fine.
I'll just talk on my own.

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:10.783
I was told by Onizuka-sensei to compete
without thinking it through.

00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:16.084
But I really want Miyabi-chan
to win. Really.

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:17.419
So?

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:22.890
So, I'll be cheering for you.
Good luck.

00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:26.830
I don't need you to wish me luck.
I'm sure I'll win.

00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:30.599
You're right. You will win.

00:09:31.575 --> 00:09:35.272
Don't come near me, you trash can!

00:09:38.382 --> 00:09:41.783
Now I think I should
memorize my lines.

00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:45.748
I'm sorry.

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:50.355
I'm sorry.

00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:58.201
Staff Only
Do Not Enter

00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:03.966
You were always shining.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.369
You were....

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.545
I can't do it.
I can't memorize at all.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.615
Always.... I was watching you....

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:23.157
-Teacher!
-So how's it going?

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:27.763
There are difficult Chinese characters,
and I can't memorize them.

00:10:27.998 --> 00:10:34.028
-I also couldn't sing well.
-Really? I could feel your passion.

00:10:34.438 --> 00:10:36.235
I can't do it.

00:10:36.473 --> 00:10:40.671
I appreciate your effort to change
a stupid person like me, but....

00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.970
-Don't say that. That F-cup-sized--
-Let me go home now.

00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:47.308
You mean, in that outfit?

00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.714
I don't wanna go back
to the greenroom.

00:10:51.722 --> 00:10:55.681
Miyabi doesn't talk to me anymore.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:58.656
Talk to her one more time
from the stage.

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:03.296
You said you'd follow
my directions, right?

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:06.534
-Continue the audition.
-But I--

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.034
You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:11.298
Miss Inogashira Pageant
Acting Exercise Script

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:23.585
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you. Nice acting.

00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:27.327
Next person. Take this, please.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.291
The next contestant,
please come on out.

00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:35.768
She will act out Scene 3.
Take it away.

00:11:37.138 --> 00:11:40.232
Number 13, Miyabi Aizawa. Thank you.

00:11:41.275 --> 00:11:44.210
-Look how they love her.
-She's already a star.

00:11:47.448 --> 00:11:51.544
A room key? It's right there.

00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:54.785
You can keep it. I don't care.

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:59.083
-She's just like an actress.
-She'll definitely win.

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:03.955
Hey, Murai, listen.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:08.027
What? Now? I haven't decided yet.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:12.365
Since it's a beautiful day,
I was going to do some cleaning.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:17.373
Like I said, I'm not worried about it
anymore. Things like this happen.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:21.479
Yeah, that's right. Don't worry.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:26.348
Call me again.
Talk to you later. Bye.

00:12:34.228 --> 00:12:38.358
That was unbelievable acting
for a 14-year-old!

00:12:38.732 --> 00:12:43.362
-Thank you very much.
-Give her another round of applause!

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.770
What a corny script. It's a joke!

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:51.672
Now the next contestant, please.

00:12:51.912 --> 00:12:54.437
Stay here and wait, please.

00:13:00.688 --> 00:13:03.486
Here, I went to buy it.
Are you happy now?

00:13:03.724 --> 00:13:05.555
Okay, okay.

00:13:05.793 --> 00:13:08.990
I'm not doing anymore favors!

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.431
-Murai, let me use your cell phone.
-What? My cell phone?

00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:18.499
Now, the last performance
of today's open audition.

00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:23.472
Number 18, Tomoko Nomura.
Please come on out.

00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:34.816
What is that? I'm embarrassed to be
in the same audition as that dork.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.320
-See? Toroko is a failure.
-Miyabi will certainly win.

00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:44.727
She is collecting herself. She will
act out Scene 2. Take it away.

00:13:57.411 --> 00:14:03.316
I can't do it.
I knew I couldn't act.

00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:06.253
Nomura!

00:14:06.787 --> 00:14:09.585
Hey, it's embarrassing!
Hurry up and sit down!

00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:13.184
Hey, what are you doing
with my cell phone?

00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:18.691
Nomura!

00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:22.858
Show them your true self.

00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:24.799
Teacher.

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:26.472
You're so embarrassing!

00:14:26.707 --> 00:14:30.268
-Let's pretend we don't know him.
-We're strangers.

00:14:32.446 --> 00:14:33.936
1. Press here
2. Then Here

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.056
Hi, this is the Aizawa residence.
We're out now.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.392
Receiving call

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:57.570
Leave a message after the beep.

00:15:03.544 --> 00:15:06.411
I was always watching you.

00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:11.750
You were always shining.

00:15:11.986 --> 00:15:16.389
It made me happy.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:22.529
That's why I was always following you.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.221
It's not from the script.

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:28.429
I wanted you to talk to me.

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:33.629
But no matter how fast I ran,
I couldn't catch up with you.

00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:38.238
I knew that from the beginning...

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:42.347
...but all I wanted was to talk
with you with a smile.

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:46.952
I don't know when this whole thing
turned into such a mess.

00:15:58.432 --> 00:16:04.769
It was fun to be with you.
We had plenty of time together.

00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:10.506
No matter what my problem was,
whenever I talked with you...

00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:13.474
...it disappeared right away.

00:16:18.118 --> 00:16:23.317
You're smart and cool
and you're always dependable.

00:16:23.557 --> 00:16:27.857
You are my favorite.
But I can never catch up with you.

00:16:31.765 --> 00:16:37.203
Never mind. I'll just
watch you from a distance.

00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:45.244
So don't mind me.

00:16:45.479 --> 00:16:48.846
I'll take care of myself somehow.

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:22.041
But I have one favor to ask of you.

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:28.987
I want you to be always smiling...

00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:32.921
...because you're...

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.391
...you're my favorite friend.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.497
My favorite friend.

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:50.637
Now, goodbye.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:15.194
Congratulations on the special award.

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:18.666
-Let me take your picture!
-Can we have an interview?

00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:21.272
-Do you have an agent?
-I'm just a....

00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:25.569
I'm the winner. I can't stand it!

00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:30.613
-Toroko was awesome.
-I was so moved!

00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:33.115
She got cards from TV companies.

00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:35.514
She may get her start
in show business.

00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:39.283
I'm impressed Onizuka could see
such talent in Toroko.

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:41.153
Onizuka's not bad.

00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:43.124
-Where's Miyabi?
-She went home.

00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:45.729
Maybe she's shocked
she came in second.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:50.026
Phone cards, posters, dolls.
All kinds of Tomoko Nomura goods.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.602
Tomoko Nomura Premium Goods
Direct Sales

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.206
You bastard,
when did you make all these?

00:18:55.442 --> 00:19:00.539
Shut your mouth and help. If we sell
enough, I'll buy you a cell phone.

00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:04.308
You gave mine to Toroko
without permission!

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.320
I've been looking....

00:19:07.554 --> 00:19:08.782
Oh, crap!

00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:12.786
Fuyutsuki-chan, what are you doing here?

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:15.961
Oh, you wanted to witness
Nomura becoming a star!

00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:18.721
No, that's not it.

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:23.565
-You're here too, Vice Principal.
-Bastard! This is unheard of!

00:19:23.804 --> 00:19:27.968
Please calm down. I'm sure
Onizuka-sensei had his own idea.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:32.770
How? He doesn't think! Why is he
selling such things to begin with?

00:19:33.013 --> 00:19:35.038
Teacher, are you all right?

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:38.080
Why don't you drink this
and catch your breath?

00:19:38.652 --> 00:19:41.985
You can't trick me!

00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:44.714
He bought that drink.

00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.222
It's been a long time
since I shook it!

00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:50.021
You bastard, what did you say?

00:19:50.264 --> 00:19:51.492
You're fired!

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.460
I want you to be always smiling.

00:19:56.069 --> 00:20:01.871
Because you're my favorite friend.
My favorite friend.

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:03.872
Now, goodbye.

00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:13.577
Good sale. We'd have sold more
if that baldy hadn't shown up.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.587
Teacher, thank you so much for today.

00:20:18.825 --> 00:20:21.293
You sound so stiff and polite.

00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:24.895
Because you went to
all that trouble for me.

00:20:25.132 --> 00:20:27.794
I heard from Kikuchi
that you helped me...

00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:31.129
...because you felt bad
about me having no friends.

00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:34.829
So I don't know what to say,
but I really appreciate--

00:20:35.075 --> 00:20:39.341
You're being silly. I didn't do
anything. That was your own doing.

00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:42.241
Besides, I made money thanks to you.

00:20:42.482 --> 00:20:44.211
Teacher.

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:50.052
Kikuchi told me that
this would make you happy.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.588
It's the only way
I can return the favor.

00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:57.456
You silly thing. Do you think
that small thing will make me happy?

00:20:59.132 --> 00:21:02.329
If you want to please me,
you need to do...

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.064
...something like this!

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:10.472
What is that? A dirty butt!

00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:15.242
-What's he doing?
-It's his way of hiding embarrassment.

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:17.916
It could be....

00:21:18.752 --> 00:21:22.381
It could be that
school might get fun like before...

00:21:22.622 --> 00:21:25.648
...because we have him
as our homeroom teacher.

00:21:25.892 --> 00:21:28.952
You brat!

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.044
You and me, let's go away

00:21:46.318 --> 00:21:51.278
To look for new emotions today

00:21:51.523 --> 00:21:56.324
Together we can overcome

00:21:56.595 --> 00:22:02.261
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:06.664
Open your eyes and open the door

00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:11.875
The world in front of your eyes

00:22:12.678 --> 00:22:17.479
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:22.081
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:32.889
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:22:33.498 --> 00:22:42.896
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:47.306
I want to see you, but I can't

00:22:47.579 --> 00:22:52.380
So I just embrace my love

00:22:52.684 --> 00:22:57.485
Even walking on a crowded street

00:22:57.756 --> 00:23:04.059
Your smile makes my head spin

00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:16.737
Next Episode

00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:19.700
I was thinking I should get a license.

00:23:20.679 --> 00:23:24.672
-Don't be afraid. Be courageous.
-Get ready!

00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:29.546
Keep on acting silly, Onizuka.
Very soon my world will be perfect.
