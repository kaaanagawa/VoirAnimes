WEBVTT

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:21.453
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:27.764
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.834
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.573
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:44.345
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:49.315
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:55.390
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.189
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.857
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.527
Flash!
I'm the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.873 --> 00:01:13.742
Toward the finish line

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:42.164
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san.
Tell us whom Kamioka likes.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.493
Hi, To, Mi

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:50.762
It's Hitomi!
Don't you really like Hitomi?

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:52.942
No. That's not true.

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:55.337
Look, Hitomi is blushing too.

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:56.705
Hitomi

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:00.110
Does this mean
a bookworm couple is born?

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:04.514
-Teacher, how about Takahashi?
-No, I'll pass.

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:09.715
-Well, Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san....
-Come on! Stop it!

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:13.157
Oh, Kokkuri-san? It's so dumb.

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:16.696
Don't play such a stupid game
just before the bell.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.598
Playing Kokkuri-san
is for little kids.

00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:23.971
Oh, it's so dumb. Stupid.

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:30.078
You know that Kokkuri-san is a
self-hypnotic trick. I heard it on TV.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.047
Kokkuri-san, who has
the stinkiest feet in our class?

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.513
Mu, Ra, I

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:40.515
See, it is Murai!

00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:46.454
-Well, I thought so.
-Maybe he's growing natto fungi there.

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:48.358
Kokkuri-san...

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:53.058
...is the rumor true
that he has crotch rot?

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:55.595
It says he does!

00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:58.603
Who says so?
You bastard! I'll kill you!

00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:02.642
Kokkuri-san, until what age
did Murai wet his bed?

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:04.472
What are you asking?

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:09.948
You don't believe in Kokkuri-san,
right? Then it shouldn't bother you.

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:13.611
Kokkuri-san, who has
a serious mother complex here?

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:16.257
Murai.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.895
-I knew it!
-Because Murai's mother is a babe.

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:22.690
We declare you
King of Mother Complexes.

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:28.633
You baboon! Don't you be barking!
I'm gonna crack your head open!

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:34.005
Today's homeroom meeting's over.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.704
-Someone, put up the attendance book.
-I'm gonna get you one day!

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:40.576
What? Let's do more.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:46.085
Sorry, but I have a previous
engagement I can't change. See you!

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.019
Hey, hey. Wait. You!

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:54.058
What was that sound?

00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:57.532
Why in the world is
a pack of natto here?

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:03.730
I vaguely remember that Onizuka-sensei
brought it during lunchtime.

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:07.270
Stinky!

00:04:08.077 --> 00:04:10.602
Onizuka!

00:04:14.017 --> 00:04:18.954
-Whose feet stinks and has crotch rot?
-Calm down.

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.558
-And who has a mother complex?
-Kunio!

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.666
Mom. What kind of outfit is that?

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.859
You like it?
Don't I look good in this?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.038
Of course it looks good.

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:39.572
But not in public!
Your underwear's almost showing!

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:43.769
I was waiting for you guys.
Let's go bowling!

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:50.350
Come on. Bowling with a parent?
In the ninth grade?

00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:52.316
Let's go. Let's go.

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:55.218
-Let me carry it for you.
-Thank you.

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:58.656
Hey, you guys!

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:05.391
That's strange.
I thought he was waiting here.

00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:09.867
-Is there anyone else coming?
-Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:05:10.506 --> 00:05:11.996
Hello, teacher!

00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:16.601
Onizuka! Damn it!
Why did you come?

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:20.249
Is this the previous engagement
he was talking about?

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.409
You guys! That's exactly why
I invited him today.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.386
I really need you to get along
with your teacher.

00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:30.855
Let's go bowling together.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.754
Oh! He clearly frowned just now!
He was saying, "Shh! Shh!"

00:05:35.965 --> 00:05:39.332
What are you saying?
A teacher wouldn't do that.

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.436
Mom, you're being deceived!

00:05:42.638 --> 00:05:47.337
I'm not gonna make dinner tonight!
I'm sorry for his attitude.

00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:49.568
Oh, no problem.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.912
Let's enjoy today.
Come on. Hurry, hurry.

00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:04.558
Finally, finally, my Cresta is back.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.694
It was worth begging.

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:11.833
Technically, I didn't destroy it.
So it shouldn't have been an issue.

00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:16.334
-Vice Principal, we'll all be gone.
-Okay.

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.531
Please don't forget to lock up.

00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:24.475
If I park it by the back gate,
it won't be damaged by Onizuka.

00:06:26.482 --> 00:06:28.973
Don't touch it with your dirty hands!

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:32.552
Who the hell are you? Damn it!

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:35.246
I need to polish it.

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:43.326
Let's make you nice
and shiny, my Cresta!

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.564
Staff Room

00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:53.001
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone!

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.975
Oh, my Cresta!

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.410
Rock and paper!

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:01.913
Team Smile

00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:04.348
Team Frown

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:07.683
Then I'll go first.

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:20.168
-She did it!
-I did it, I did it, I did it!

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:22.963
Your form was excellent!

00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:27.302
I know! You might not know,
but I wanted to be a pro bowler.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.506
No wonder you are so good!

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.548
I'll kill you if you gutter-ball it.

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:37.446
Don't talk in your sleep, baboon!

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:47.153
Dear Kunio, the first throw goes
into the gutter? Don't worry!

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:55.561
It's a strike.
Teacher, don't pull my leg.

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.782
What is that submarine throw?

00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:11.749
It's not baseball!
You're not Satonaka!

00:08:11.954 --> 00:08:14.821
You idiot! It's going
into the next lane!

00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:16.385
What?!

00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:20.327
Strike! Victory!

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.922
What do you mean?
The pins are in pieces!

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:26.897
No pins are standing,
so it's a strike.

00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:29.401
Hello, this is Murai.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:35.267
What? Really?
Yes, yes, I understand.

00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:40.006
Okay, okay. You'd do the same
for me if I were in trouble.

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:44.346
I'm sorry. I need to go
to the construction site.

00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:48.649
The other crane driver,
Naka-chan, got hurt.

00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:54.586
But enjoy the rest among yourselves.
I'm going straight to the site.

00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:58.028
I'll pay!
Teacher, take care of the rest!

00:08:58.234 --> 00:09:01.067
Oh, wait! Wait, mother!

00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:04.066
Oh, man.

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:10.909
Why do I need to bowl with you?

00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:13.479
With a kid with stinky feet.

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:19.548
That's my line, you baboon.
I'm gonna send you back to Africa!

00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:25.858
-No way, Murai. Serious?
-That's not good.

00:09:29.065 --> 00:09:31.829
Ouch! You bastard!

00:09:32.368 --> 00:09:34.268
You idiot!

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:41.670
It happens when a baboon
challenges humans.

00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:46.641
You brat. I was being easy on you
because you're a student.

00:09:46.849 --> 00:09:50.683
Very well. I'm gonna kill you!

00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:01.392
What fun!

00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:06.096
What's with this?
I can't take my fingers out.

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:08.327
Could it be a curse?

00:10:08.704 --> 00:10:11.832
You got tricked!
I thought this might happen!

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:16.307
So I put some crazy glue
in the holes. You idiot!

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:18.010
What?

00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:21.377
Spend your life with balls
for hands like Doraemon!

00:10:21.584 --> 00:10:23.745
Wait! Call a rescue crew!

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.214
-See you, Doraemon!
-Hey, wait a minute!

00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:30.688
Murai....

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:36.394
That was the best!
The dumb look on Onizuka's face!

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:39.864
-Wasn't that too much?
-He was getting panicky.

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:44.165
Don't tell me you guys are
gonna be on Onizuka's side.

00:10:44.373 --> 00:10:47.831
-It's not that.
-It's just that he is a teacher.

00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:52.643
What are you afraid of?
It doesn't matter.

00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:55.817
That baboon is gonna
get fired soon anyway.

00:10:56.018 --> 00:11:00.921
Shit! Someone parked at
the wrong place on the street!

00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:06.527
Hey, little boys! Do you have
a problem with our car?

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:10.961
Can you not touch it
with your dirty feet?

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:21.838
This is disastrous.
It's a brand-new car.

00:11:22.046 --> 00:11:26.176
Oh, no. What are you gonna do
about all the scratches?

00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:28.317
Scratched? I don't think so.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:32.011
I just kicked the tire.
I couldn't have scratched it.

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:35.522
But there are scratches.

00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:38.627
The only way to fix it
is to repaint it.

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:42.026
Do you know that repainting
a car costs a fortune?

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:46.966
-Look, here's a scratch too.
-You're just blowing smoke!

00:11:47.171 --> 00:11:49.867
Ouch! I have a broken bone!

00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:52.975
-Hang in there!
-Are you all right?

00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:56.146
What? How could that break his bone?

00:11:56.347 --> 00:12:00.750
It is broken.
We are calcium-deprived.

00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:05.854
Or are you trying to say
my friends are lying?

00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:12.120
It is broken big-time. I would say
it'll take 500 years to recover.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:16.663
What will you do? Car repairs,
medical bills, plus punitive damage.

00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:20.598
-It'll cost over a million yen.
-That's outrageous.

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:26.573
We'll kidnap and beat you guys up.
Then decide if you want to pay.

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:31.280
-Run!
-Bratty kids!

00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:36.546
Kusano!

00:12:36.954 --> 00:12:42.415
What's wrong? Aren't you gonna
run away? If you wanna run, go ahead!

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:46.084
If you go, we'll take really
good care of this guy.

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:49.460
In place of you.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.198
-You guys fight dirty!
-What shall we do?

00:12:54.405 --> 00:12:56.202
Is something wrong?

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:59.768
That's Onizuka. We're saved!

00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:02.104
I'm not Onizuka.

00:13:02.313 --> 00:13:06.647
I'm Doraemon from the 22nd century.

00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:08.512
Doraemon

00:13:09.486 --> 00:13:12.478
-Onizuka?
-Don't joke around, teacher!

00:13:12.823 --> 00:13:18.261
Teacher? What are you talking about?
I told you I was Doraemon.

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:22.193
Hey, guys. Are you
harassing these kids?

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.867
Looks like fun. Can I join you?

00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:28.562
-Could you give me a light?
-Oh, sure.

00:13:28.772 --> 00:13:30.137
Who are you?

00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:34.971
Me? I'm Doraemon.
I'm the head of the Santama group.

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:38.876
-You're the head of Santama?
-Right. Nice to meet you.

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:42.917
Why are you befriending them?
Aren't you a teacher?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.786
You guys are so annoying.
I am Doraemon. I don't know you guys.

00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.724
Unbelievable!

00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:56.264
Well, if I were a teacher,
I would probably tell you guys this:

00:13:56.834 --> 00:14:02.170
You should be men enough to
take care of your own problems.

00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:06.207
-Let go of me! Shit!
-I'm telling you to stop!

00:14:07.378 --> 00:14:11.439
-They look so dorky, like larvae!
-They look nice and warm!

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:16.609
-Now we have human punching bags!
-Hitting them should feel very real.

00:14:16.954 --> 00:14:21.357
Do you think you can get away
with this? We'll report it!

00:14:21.558 --> 00:14:23.958
Then you guys will--

00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:26.789
A punching bag shouldn't be talking.

00:14:26.997 --> 00:14:32.264
Hey, Joe! Show your punches
to the children of Namidabashi!

00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:36.428
Rule number one for tomorrow:
Left jab to the inside.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.665
-Hit! Hit!
-Please don't!

00:14:38.876 --> 00:14:42.107
I will burn out till I turn to ashes.

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:44.144
-One, two--
-Wait!

00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:47.875
-Teacher!
-What is it, Doraemon?

00:14:48.085 --> 00:14:53.455
You guys are too lenient.
How long have you been gang members?

00:14:53.657 --> 00:14:56.717
As a bystander,
I wouldn't be satisfied until...

00:14:56.927 --> 00:15:02.388
...I see your manhood by dragging them
with a motorcycle around the city.

00:15:02.599 --> 00:15:05.295
-Really?
-How about burning them alive?

00:15:05.502 --> 00:15:09.029
-Target practice?
-Dipping them into the pond?

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:11.867
All of them lack true originality.

00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:15.077
-What the hell?!
-Save us, teacher!

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.839
Oh, I know. Push them over!

00:15:18.182 --> 00:15:22.278
A bungee jump from the Bay Bridge.
Isn't that cool?

00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:25.148
Hey, Onizuka! You're joking, right?

00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:28.484
-You're gonna kill us?
-Teacher, please!

00:15:33.397 --> 00:15:36.161
Ready, set, go!

00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:45.833
-Wow, it's outrageously high!
-It took five seconds!

00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:51.538
Are you crazy? Are you seriously
gonna let them do this, Onizuka?

00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:53.942
You'll be fine. We have rope.

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:58.581
-Those are for packing boxes!
-You usually use a bungee cord!

00:15:59.223 --> 00:16:02.624
The right way is to use a rope.
Plastic stretches.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.693
If you double it, it'll be fine.

00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:08.592
-Okay, do you wanna get started?
-Yeah!

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:12.235
Stop, stop! Hey, let go!
Help, someone!

00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:15.837
What a wimp!
You act so big at school.

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:20.642
When things get tough,
don't whine and count on others.

00:16:20.844 --> 00:16:24.644
Show some guts.
Aren't you man enough?

00:16:24.848 --> 00:16:27.578
Or are you just a guy
with a mother complex?

00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:29.047
What did you say?

00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:35.958
You couldn't protect the most important
thing for you the other day too.

00:16:38.896 --> 00:16:42.855
No matter how he normally is,
he does what he needs to do.

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:45.194
That's how a man should be.

00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:54.442
Very well, I'll show you I can jump!

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:57.440
-Murai....
-Don't be ridiculous!

00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:04.054
If I jump, I'll never
let you touch my mother!

00:17:25.442 --> 00:17:27.603
-Murai!
-Are you all right?

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.514
A perfect score, Kunio.

00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:38.711
-Hold on! We'll pull you up.
-Murai!

00:17:38.922 --> 00:17:40.685
This is entertaining!

00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:45.828
Which brat will challenge his fear
of Bay Bridge bungee jumping?

00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:49.430
Wait a second.
Doraemon, what are you doing?

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:54.366
What am I doing? The next is
your turn. You know, taking turns.

00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:59.338
What are you saying? Don't make
stupid jokes! You're just Doraemon!

00:18:03.013 --> 00:18:06.540
Who the hell is that?

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:11.451
What is it?

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:17.226
I've come to save Yuria
from you villains.

00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:20.055
I'm Kenshiro!

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:21.595
Kenshiro

00:18:21.798 --> 00:18:25.029
No joke!

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.024
Monster!

00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:57.666
I won't let you get away!

00:19:01.138 --> 00:19:03.606
The key is gone!

00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:09.677
Get in, guys!

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.472
He is so used to it.

00:19:11.682 --> 00:19:14.173
Is he really a teacher?

00:19:16.687 --> 00:19:19.383
What an ordeal.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.854
You bastard!

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:26.325
Damn it! He's coming after me!

00:19:32.603 --> 00:19:34.537
Slow down!

00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:38.868
You dummy! You're gonna end up
letting them get away!

00:19:39.977 --> 00:19:42.912
I'll show you my skills!

00:19:43.113 --> 00:19:46.708
What's up, Murai?
What are you looking at?

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.618
This is the vice principal's car!

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.845
Those guys stole his car!

00:19:52.055 --> 00:19:55.616
What did you say?
Now we have to get revenge for him!

00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:03.399
-You destroyed a trash can!
-Shut up! Be quiet!

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:05.531
Wow! A bicycle!

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:11.505
Wow! Traffic signs!

00:20:12.743 --> 00:20:14.938
A mailbox!

00:20:15.145 --> 00:20:17.340
Wow! A vending machine!

00:20:17.547 --> 00:20:20.380
Hey, wait! You villain!

00:20:20.584 --> 00:20:23.747
Please! Don't come!

00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:28.981
Those two cars! Stop!

00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:45.834
Hold up! Stop!

00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:49.976
I'll never let him get away!

00:20:50.447 --> 00:20:53.439
Please spare me, Doraemon!

00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.725
Good morning!

00:21:04.094 --> 00:21:07.655
My Cresta, where have you gone?

00:21:07.864 --> 00:21:12.198
Vice Principal! Your car is
in the parking lot!

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.662
Was it found?

00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:18.102
Let me through. Please move over!

00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:25.508
My Cresta!

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.945
You must be the owner.

00:21:29.152 --> 00:21:32.815
We need to ask you
some questions about a car chase.

00:21:33.023 --> 00:21:35.890
-What?
-It won't take very long.

00:21:36.093 --> 00:21:37.424
What is this?

00:21:37.994 --> 00:21:43.364
-The vice principal in a car chase?
-I didn't do anything! I'm the victim!

00:21:43.567 --> 00:21:47.367
Look at my Cresta! I....

00:21:47.571 --> 00:21:50.836
Midnight Car Chase

00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:53.506
Amazing! It's the top story!

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.340
Let me see. The criminal was
an animation character? So stupid!

00:21:58.548 --> 00:22:01.142
It can't be true.

00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:05.510
But it's amazing that
we got away from the police.

00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:08.782
My driving technique is
as good as Initial D.

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:11.619
What? The car was totaled!

00:22:11.828 --> 00:22:14.262
The streets in Tokyo are too narrow.

00:22:14.765 --> 00:22:17.359
But I've never been so excited!

00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:22.630
I thought so.
Hey, Kunio! Dearest Kunio!

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:26.673
Could you pass me
my cigarettes and lighter?

00:22:27.377 --> 00:22:30.904
Hey, Murai. Are you still upset
about the bungee jump?

00:22:31.114 --> 00:22:34.550
Just let it go.
It got us away from those jerks.

00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:37.686
Come on, hurry up.

00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:44.085
You hold grudges, don't you?

00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:47.286
Kunio, don't take too much time--

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.961
You got tricked! So corny!

00:22:52.169 --> 00:22:56.902
When you were busy reading the paper,
I turned the flame up.

00:22:59.342 --> 00:23:02.800
Well, I'll call it even now.

00:23:03.013 --> 00:23:07.882
You want me to be friendly
with you. I guess that's okay.

00:23:08.084 --> 00:23:11.815
How can you call it even?
I'll get change.

00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:14.282
What about my hair?!

00:23:14.724 --> 00:23:18.717
You look like a juvenile delinquent
in an old cartoon!

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:21.022
Silver Fly

00:23:21.231 --> 00:23:25.565
Don't laugh! I'm gonna make
all of you bungee jump again!

00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:46.157
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.397 --> 00:23:51.391
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.602 --> 00:23:56.437
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.674 --> 00:24:02.374
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.613 --> 00:24:06.777
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.552 --> 00:24:11.989
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.757 --> 00:24:17.592
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:22.194
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.434 --> 00:24:33.002
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:42.976
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:43.187 --> 00:24:47.419
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.658 --> 00:24:52.493
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.764 --> 00:24:57.599
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.835 --> 00:25:04.172
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:17.453
Next Episode

00:25:21.659 --> 00:25:24.958
What? An underwear thief!

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.666
Isn't it possible that
a teacher is the thief?

00:25:32.203 --> 00:25:33.727
That hurts.

00:25:33.938 --> 00:25:39.205
Are you okay?
Wait, you're in my class.

00:25:40.178 --> 00:25:45.775
My name is Tomoko Nomura.
But please call me Tomo-chan!
