WEBVTT

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:11.584
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:17.049
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:23.558
This street makes me love

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:27.502
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:33.441
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:39.019
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.658
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:49.226
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:54.868
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.706 --> 00:01:01.076
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:06.442
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.610
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:19.490
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.961
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.433
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:53.761
Toroko!

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.028
Teacher!
Don't worry about me! Run!

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:01.359
Don't be an idiot!

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:02.861
Hurry up!

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:18.291
There they are! This way!

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:24.635
Damn it!

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:29.207
How could this happen?!

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.358
I'm going to deliver this?

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.195
Yes. I want you
to take the evidence...

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:45.665
...from the recent raid...

00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:46.996
...to headquarters.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.538
What's inside?

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.103
You don't need to know.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:54.543
Yes, sir!

00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:56.975
All you need to do
is follow your orders.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.139
Be very careful
when delivering the item.

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.309
You are to never, ever
open the case! That's all!

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:05.849
I, Officer Toshiyuki Saejima...

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:08.716
...will deliver the evidence
to headquarters!

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:20.598
Why do I have to deliver
something so heavy?!

00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:24.738
"You are to never,
ever open the case"?

00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:25.941
Damn!

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:27.743
It's open!

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.043
These are.!

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.594
Toroko is becoming quite stunning.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:50.857
Her makeup is well done.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.468
Her body is incredible!

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:57.498
Yeah, she deserves
her Glossy Photo Queen title.

00:03:57.674 --> 00:03:59.107
She rose to the top.

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:01.541
Really. I can't believe...

00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:03.305
...she used to be made
fun of and called names.

00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:04.437
Oops, she fell.

00:04:04.714 --> 00:04:06.545
Oh, well, she's still Toroko.

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:12.248
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:17.923
Can they show this?! Can they?!

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:21.892
Man, they're big!

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.192
Big is good.

00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:29.104
Teacher!

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:34.609
I don't know what to do!

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.276
Please help me!

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.741
Calm down, Toroko.

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.408
Your chest is crushing Onizuka.

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:49.982
So what happened?

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:52.521
You don't get upset very often.

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:56.364
My contract may be sold.

00:04:58.201 --> 00:04:59.498
The president of
our production company...

00:04:59.802 --> 00:05:02.066
...did a lot of stuff
during the bubble economy...

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.731
...and now he's got to repay.

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:06.798
Once, in order to settle his debt...

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:09.840
...I was taken to a party
with a lot of scary guys...

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.347
...and another time...

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:13.074
...I was told I had to be
in a totally nude photo layout.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.416
What?!

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.717
No matter what, I can't do it!

00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.418
Hey, there. It's all right. Don't worry.

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:27.796
Let's go!

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.961
Wait, Teacher!

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:43.675
- Toroko!
- Yes!

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:47.315
Your top-notch manager,
Eikichi Onizuka...

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:51.445
...will give the wimps at your
production company a lesson...

00:05:51.554 --> 00:05:53.351
...in how this industry works.

00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:10.366
Hooray!

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:11.701
No wonder it was heavy!

00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:14.936
I had no idea that it was
filled with gold bars!

00:06:20.683 --> 00:06:22.742
I should bruise
my face or something...

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:27.154
...and say I was robbed
by Yakuza on my way...

00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:30.215
...and when things settle down...

00:06:30.493 --> 00:06:32.154
... I can quit and go abroad.

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:34.487
Then all of these
gold bars will be mine.

00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:36.660
And to top it off,
I can collect my pension.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:41.897
Well, how should I spend it?

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.996
Should I go to Hawaii and have
blond escort girls go out with me?

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:49.002
Or should I drive a Mercedes
and wear designer clothes...

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:51.910
...and live extravagantly
in Roppongi?

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:54.578
- So Romeo!
- Oh, I can't wait.

00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:56.751
Call me!

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.788
The vibration is getting
strong in your chest.

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.381
This is for you.

00:07:01.724 --> 00:07:04.921
That's right. I can have a beautiful
girl like Tomoko Nomura...

00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:08.486
This is Juliet.

00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:10.628
- Pasoko from the Internet?
- Who's disturbing my dreams?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.431
Stop making a racket! Hold on!

00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:19.799
I don't believe it!

00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:22.144
Hello!

00:07:22.812 --> 00:07:24.780
I'm Tomoko Nomura!

00:07:25.214 --> 00:07:26.203
All right.

00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.218
Hi!

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:34.349
What are you doing?
Open the door for your friend.

00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:36.386
Eikichi, what's up?

00:07:36.492 --> 00:07:38.289
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:40.289
Come on in, Toroko.

00:07:40.563 --> 00:07:41.530
Hi, how are you?

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:45.957
Tomoko Nomura?

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:48.003
Is she for real?

00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:52.305
Didn't I tell you?
She's one of my students.

00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:55.805
- Could I have your autograph?
- Sure.

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:59.146
Please add "To Saejima-san."

00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:00.608
Thank you.

00:08:00.983 --> 00:08:03.247
Well, I'll see you later.
I'm busy now.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.280
Busy? Weren't you just
counting your money?

00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:11.158
He's uncanny! I wonder
if he knows about my gold bars...

00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:13.418
... with his instincts like a hyena.

00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:19.434
I got it!

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:23.996
You've been saving this every day
to go to a massage parlor, right?

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.236
Good guess, Eikichi.
You're pretty sharp!

00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:28.343
Hey, what's this?

00:08:31.848 --> 00:08:33.008
What is this?

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:34.377
It's nothing!

00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:36.883
If it's nothing, let me see it.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:37.953
Stop it! This is my precious...

00:08:41.924 --> 00:08:43.824
Wow, these are gold, aren't they?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.387
They're mine! I won't let
anyone take them away!

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.295
Saejima, you.!

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:55.326
Saejima-san. This is the police.

00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:57.430
I'll be right there.

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:00.576
Don't answer it!

00:09:01.577 --> 00:09:02.703
But it's the police.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:04.941
Saejima-san?

00:09:05.314 --> 00:09:07.578
- Oh, no! They're already here!
- Damn! They're Yakuza!

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:11.914
What did you do?!

00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:14.949
How did you get those gold bars?

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:16.557
It's none of your business.

00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:18.654
Then there's no problem
if I open the door?

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:22.156
It's you who'll be in trouble
if you open it.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.507
Now!

00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:33.836
- Run!
- What?

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:42.249
Wait!

00:09:44.887 --> 00:09:45.854
Toroko!

00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:50.893
Tacher!
Don't worry about me! Run!

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:52.085
Don't be an idiot!

00:09:52.662 --> 00:09:53.629
Hurry up!

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:04.229
There they are! This way!

00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:06.074
Wait! You!

00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:08.740
There are more of them?!

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.012
We're boxed in!

00:10:12.515 --> 00:10:16.007
Damn it! How could this happen?!

00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:17.344
- Teacher!
- Let's go!

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:22.758
Damn!

00:10:28.097 --> 00:10:29.064
What?!

00:10:31.634 --> 00:10:32.601
Crap!

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.367
I thought I was going to die.

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:37.600
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:41.309
You don't need to apologize
to someone like him.

00:10:44.847 --> 00:10:46.576
What's going on, Eikichi?!

00:10:46.983 --> 00:10:50.419
Well, her production
company is in trouble.

00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:52.586
So I went to the office
to discuss it with the president...

00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:53.655
PINK ELEPHANT

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:55.747
But the president was already gone.

00:11:00.162 --> 00:11:01.754
You hit... Yakuza?

00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:05.396
How can I just stand by
when my student is in trouble?

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:07.833
Idiot! The world
of gangsters is dangerous.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.038
You're an adult now.

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:14.539
You should know that some things
are out of an individual's control.

00:11:15.277 --> 00:11:17.837
That's why I've come
to a government official.

00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:18.914
I don't know about that!

00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:22.815
If you hadn't come, I would have
been headed to Hawaii by now.

00:11:24.253 --> 00:11:27.347
Ah, police?
I picked up some gold bars.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.957
Idiot! Stop it!

00:11:29.859 --> 00:11:32.953
You're also involved in some
risky business, aren't you?

00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:36.062
We have no choice.
Should we team up?

00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:37.532
All right.

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:41.398
Let's go to Hawaii!

00:11:42.071 --> 00:11:44.164
I'm going to get
some blond escorts!

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:48.735
I guess I'm on my own.

00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:58.802
WAI HA DE PA TSU KIN
(BLONDE IN HAWAII)

00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:06.365
What are you doing?
Where is it?

00:12:06.571 --> 00:12:07.539
There it is!

00:12:14.118 --> 00:12:15.086
Let's go!

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.513
Hey! Wait a minute!

00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:19.492
How can we go to Hawaii
in such a crappy boat?!

00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:21.998
Don't worry!

00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:23.158
It looks crappy on the outside...

00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:26.239
...but it's a lot faster
than a police boat!

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.910
We've got gold bars!
We should go first class!

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:31.538
With this much gold...

00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:34.846
...how can we leave Narita Airport
in such a conspicuous way?!

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.850
Oh, no! They're already here!

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.398
Hurry up!

00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:41.967
There they are! Wait!

00:12:46.977 --> 00:12:48.946
Hey! Don't leave without us!

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.755
What are you doing?! Jump!

00:12:57.996 --> 00:12:58.964
Quickly!

00:12:59.198 --> 00:13:00.166
But...

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:01.235
Toroko!

00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:03.738
Teacher!

00:13:05.276 --> 00:13:06.539
Turn around!

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:08.337
Give me the case!

00:13:09.516 --> 00:13:10.484
Hurry up!

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:13.824
Get this boat.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:15.852
Thanks for your help.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:23.731
I did it! The gold bars are mine!

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.487
Teacher!

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:36.856
Toroko, wait for me.

00:13:48.686 --> 00:13:50.848
Excuse me,
may I ask you a question?

00:13:51.057 --> 00:13:52.024
What is it?

00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:54.218
What will happen to me?

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:55.497
Don't worry.

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:59.096
You're valuable merchandise.
We won't harm you.

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:04.175
But if you don't listen to us,
those guys are dead.

00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:09.545
President! Manager-san!

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.025
Tomoko!

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:12.557
I'm sorry, Tomoko.

00:14:12.762 --> 00:14:14.925
I've caused you so much trouble.

00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.067
It's not your fault!

00:14:17.604 --> 00:14:18.594
It's part of their plan!

00:14:19.006 --> 00:14:20.908
They pretend
to help those in need...

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:23.069
...but their contract is rigged.

00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:26.519
Don't speak such slander!

00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:29.013
We're just doing business!

00:14:29.325 --> 00:14:31.887
We've got our pot of gold.
They're useless to us now.

00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:33.794
Should we throw
them in Kisarazu Bay?

00:14:36.037 --> 00:14:37.004
Manager-san!

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.940
So, miss, what are
you going to do?

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:43.683
Who's there?!

00:14:47.858 --> 00:14:50.158
You don't need
to know my name, punk.

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:53.123
You can just call me
a wanderer with a guitar.

00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:55.771
Teacher!

00:14:56.807 --> 00:14:58.708
He's here again.
What should we do with him?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.242
We've gone this far.
How can we stop now?!

00:15:00.614 --> 00:15:03.949
This isn't good.
Is he really a teacher?

00:15:05.757 --> 00:15:07.692
What's going on?

00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:09.156
Don't ask me.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.522
I can't go through with this!

00:15:11.633 --> 00:15:12.726
Onizuka-san!

00:15:14.806 --> 00:15:16.672
I'm going to beat everyone...

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:19.645
...who's given
my student any trouble.

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.050
That's enough!

00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:31.224
Any more and I'll cut her throat!

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:34.040
Teacher!

00:15:34.307 --> 00:15:36.504
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:47.363
Onizuka!

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.598
Saejima!

00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:51.267
Who are you?!

00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:52.439
Shut up!

00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:54.240
Saejima! You came!

00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:56.079
Of course!

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.914
This is great! Even though
they're usually fighting...

00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:00.645
... when one is in trouble,
the other backs him up.

00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:02.882
This is the way of true
friendship between men!

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:06.297
I can't settle down
unless I hit you once, you thief!

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.333
That's what I was going to say!

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.233
I haven't been able
to count on you for a long time.

00:16:10.338 --> 00:16:11.931
You betrayed me!

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.636
Aren't you forgetting
your friendship?

00:16:15.012 --> 00:16:17.278
Friendship?! He doesn't
know what friendship is!

00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:19.286
Look!

00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:21.185
You tried to switch the gold!

00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:24.318
How can you say that?
You pushed me into the water!

00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:26.899
Because you tried
to steal my gold bars!

00:16:27.001 --> 00:16:28.765
Your gold bars?!

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.500
You're a police officer
and you were going to steal them!

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:33.877
- Why can't a police officer steal?
- Excuse me...

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:35.242
...if you could help me...

00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:39.388
What's that?

00:16:40.324 --> 00:16:41.553
The Yakuza are gone!

00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:45.031
You've been a lot of trouble!

00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:46.101
In that case...

00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:48.466
...I'm going to blow everyone up!

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.836
Teacher! There's
something strange over there!

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.011
Something strange?

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:56.417
That box is full of bombs.

00:16:56.587 --> 00:16:58.783
They'll go off in five minutes!

00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:05.293
I'm not involved in this!
Open up! Please open up!

00:17:05.603 --> 00:17:07.765
Wait a minute!
I didn't know about this!

00:17:08.107 --> 00:17:10.076
Where's the person in charge?!

00:17:10.511 --> 00:17:11.478
Damn!

00:17:11.914 --> 00:17:13.906
Hey! I have something!

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.813
I have gold bars!

00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:17.950
- It's true! You've got to believe me!
- I'm sorry.

00:17:18.158 --> 00:17:20.491
I caused you all this trouble.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:23.061
I owe you for so many things.

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:24.927
And I'm causing you
trouble until the end.

00:17:25.638 --> 00:17:27.072
It's not your fault.

00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:30.234
Teacher!

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:31.405
Even though we've only known
each other for a short time...

00:17:32.517 --> 00:17:35.079
Don't be foolish.
I haven't given up yet.

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:37.451
When a teacher's
student is in danger...

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.494
...he can become
almost superhuman.

00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:42.029
See? Untie everyone's ropes.

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:43.135
Yes!

00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:45.033
Eikichi, get the gold bars!

00:17:45.172 --> 00:17:46.607
I'm not giving you...?!

00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:48.678
Idiot! We're going to negotiate.

00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:51.940
If we have money, you can
pay the president's debt, too.

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:53.042
We have no choice.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.188
Here they are.

00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:55.914
Look! Gold bars!

00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:58.120
If you blow us up,
these bars will be destroyed, too!

00:17:58.296 --> 00:18:00.322
I don't care about them!

00:18:01.168 --> 00:18:02.898
I have nothing to do with this!

00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:09.548
Teacher!

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.688
Duck!

00:18:12.822 --> 00:18:13.790
Teacher!

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.491
Surprise!

00:18:24.209 --> 00:18:27.271
You still don't get it?
Tomoko, what does this say?

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.676
Star Dokkiri...
(Celebrity Candid Camera)

00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:32.512
Yes! That means...

00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:35.424
Well, all those things, like
President being in debt...

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:37.925
...and my contract being sold...

00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:41.137
...and the Yakuza chasing me...

00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:43.140
...and the bomb
going to explode...

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:44.538
Were all lies!

00:18:47.617 --> 00:18:49.176
CELEBRITY CANDID CAMERA

00:18:49.286 --> 00:18:51.688
That's all for the rising star,
Tomoko Nomura's prank.

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:55.924
She was completely fooled
by her manager and the others!

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.225
Wait a minute!

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.566
Then how about these gold bars?!

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.908
Gold bars?

00:19:05.816 --> 00:19:07.375
They're here!

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.379
They're real Yakuza!

00:19:09.489 --> 00:19:10.457
Those gold bars...

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:12.994
...belong to us.

00:19:16.635 --> 00:19:17.761
What are you going to do?

00:19:17.871 --> 00:19:18.838
Don't ask me!

00:19:20.374 --> 00:19:21.741
Give them back.

00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:52.225
Surround them!

00:20:01.949 --> 00:20:04.181
What the.!

00:20:05.388 --> 00:20:06.880
Thank you for your work, Saejima.

00:20:07.091 --> 00:20:08.116
Chief!

00:20:08.928 --> 00:20:12.492
Because of your work,
we were able to catch their ring.

00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:13.569
What?

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.871
Those gold bars were payment
the Yakuza received for drugs.

00:20:18.177 --> 00:20:20.910
Is this what's known as a sting?

00:20:21.383 --> 00:20:22.942
I thought so!
I, Officer Saejima...

00:20:23.053 --> 00:20:25.319
...protected the gold bars
to the best of my ability!

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.460
However, unfortunately
I did lose some...

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:28.584
It doesn't matter.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.897
What?

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:33.304
You were in charge
of disposing of the gold bars.

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:37.300
They are fake, gold-painted lead.

00:20:37.746 --> 00:20:40.045
My Hawaiian dream...

00:20:41.987 --> 00:20:44.787
UP-CLOSE REPORT:
MIDNIGHT WITH THE POLICE

00:20:45.493 --> 00:20:48.191
Let me go, you idiot!
I'm not a Yakuza!

00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:51.061
I'm a teacher!
Hey! Get off of me!

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:53.799
In this way, we were
able to capture the moment...

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:55.569
... when the drug ring
was arrested!

00:20:56.479 --> 00:20:59.211
I'm the great teacher Onizuka!

00:20:59.317 --> 00:21:00.444
This is a documentary.

00:21:00.653 --> 00:21:02.019
Which part is the Candid Camera?

00:21:02.223 --> 00:21:04.055
It was a surprise.

00:21:04.794 --> 00:21:06.422
The newspaper is reporting it
on the front page.

00:21:06.563 --> 00:21:09.056
It says, "Tomoko Nomura helped
in the arrest of drug dealers...

00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:11.297
...through the Candid
Camera program."

00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:12.965
As always, when you
get involved with Toroko...

00:21:13.075 --> 00:21:14.304
...you're asking for trouble.

00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:16.104
It's not a laughing matter.

00:21:16.213 --> 00:21:17.340
After all of that,
I had to go through...

00:21:17.449 --> 00:21:19.078
...an interrogation
with the detectives.

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:22.781
It's because you get too excited
by her cute "Help me!"

00:21:22.926 --> 00:21:23.893
Shut up!

00:21:24.228 --> 00:21:26.201
Teacher! Help me!

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:27.500
Oh, Toroko!

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:54.746
Where is our future going?

00:21:54.856 --> 00:22:01.591
Maybe it knows of this aimless
Journey and simply flew away

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:08.867
If you can stop our gloomy days

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:15.939
I will listen to all you say

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:23.608
However much we have,
There is always something lacking

00:22:24.318 --> 00:22:30.086
The wind will always blow
And carry the scent away

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:37.960
I am searching for our future now

00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:44.629
Don't laugh because
It may really go away

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:52.375
Remember
These strained words I say

00:22:53.447 --> 00:22:59.545
The night is almost over,
So let's run through this moment

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.783
All we have is
This precious moment

00:23:03.724 --> 00:23:06.887
All we have is
This precious moment

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:10.856
Before the endless night begins

00:23:11.365 --> 00:23:15.461
Embrace this precious night

00:23:16.537 --> 00:23:17.469
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:17.572 --> 00:23:20.268
If... I decided to get married...

00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:22.506
...what would you think?

00:23:22.743 --> 00:23:23.732
M-Married?

00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:25.472
If she really loves him...

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.743
...you shouldn't stand in her way,
even if you're her son.

00:23:29.417 --> 00:23:31.044
But if that isn't the case...

00:23:36.657 --> 00:23:37.624
Kunio!

00:23:37.825 --> 00:23:39.156
You! Old man!

00:23:39.527 --> 00:23:41.290
How could you
do this to my mom?!

00:23:41.729 --> 00:23:45.096
You're having a wedding
without telling your own son!

00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:54.100
SEE YA NEXT TIME
