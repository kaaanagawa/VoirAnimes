WEBVTT

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:11.134
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:16.866
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:23.335
This street makes me love

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.093
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:33.096
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.637
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:43.539
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:49.715
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.917
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.326 --> 00:01:00.423
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:05.795
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:11.539
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:19.710
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.377
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:26.445
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:42.708
It's a lie...

00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:45.617
Right? Aizawa, it isn't true, is it?

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:47.095
It's true...

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.593
Mizuki is...dead...

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:54.284
Shoot! Please be on time!

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.223
She committed suicide
at the end of last year.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.527
Suicide...?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.497
Why...?!

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.028
What are you talking about now?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.661
Of course it's because of you.

00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:10.899
Mizuki was pregnant!

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.811
If you hadn't betrayed her
this wouldn't have happened!

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:20.372
I had no other choice.

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:21.783
No other choice!

00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:23.818
At that time the Board
of Education told me...

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:26.216
...I couldn't be
involved anymore...

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.790
Really...? I don't care...

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:34.321
The bottom line is Mizuki
won't be back anymore...

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:35.996
You guys are murderers!

00:02:58.387 --> 00:02:59.581
Am I on time?!

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.714
Welcome!
Oh, Teacher! Hello!

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:05.088
Tomoko! Your teacher is here!

00:03:05.594 --> 00:03:06.822
Coming!

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:09.289
I'll have the miso and gyoza set,
the 350 yen special...

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.457
-...it's still on, right?
- That's the real Tomo-chan!

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:12.534
All right!

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:16.536
I'm glad I got here on time!

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:18.196
Are you out of money again?

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:20.332
Payday is tomorrow.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.372
Don't be silly. We can
always give you a special price.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:29.249
No, no. That would be
an abuse of my authority.

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:32.614
You're more honest
than you look.

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.349
Let me treat you to a beer.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.319
Think of this as a visit
to a student's home.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.587
Is that right? If you say so...

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.464
Thank you very much.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.136
Next on the news.

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:50.994
Late last night, Noboru Saito,
a 24-year-old teacher...

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.573
...at the private
Reimei Women's School...

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:56.041
...in Tokyo, was stabbed
in the chest at his home...

00:03:56.144 --> 00:03:58.408
...and then taken to the hospital.

00:03:58.847 --> 00:04:01.315
He is currently
in critical condition.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.881
A neighborhood resident
witnessed a young woman...

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:06.682
...running away.

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:09.880
The police believe that this
woman is involved in the case...

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.016
...and are looking for her.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.557
Huh, involved with a woman..!

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:13.685
Next, in sports...

00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:14.829
What's the matter, Toroko?

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.460
He was our homeroom
teacher last year.

00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:21.525
Noboru-sensei Saito.

00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:25.967
Yes, Onizuka here.

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:27.697
Oh, Principal?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.140
Yes, the news?
I'm watching it now...

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.944
Is that right?

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.452
Yes.

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:39.119
When I saw the news
a little while ago...

00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.752
...I thought
I should let you know...

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:45.318
Saito-sensei was
the homeroom teacher...

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:47.088
...for the previous Class 2-4.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.253
But last summer...

00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.262
...his relationship with one
of his female students...

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.832
...was exposed by the media...

00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:56.102
...and he left the school.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.997
The female student left, too...

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:00.475
Her name was
Mizuki Yokoyama...

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:02.075
...and she was
an excellent student...

00:05:02.377 --> 00:05:04.777
...who always had
a smile on her face.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.740
She transferred.

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:09.775
What did he find sexy
about a high school kid?!

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.375
He must have
had a Lolita Complex.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.483
No, he was enthusiastic, and he
was respected by the students.

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.255
The reason why
that class started...

00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:19.621
...to terrorize their
homeroom teachers...

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:21.490
...was probably because
of what Saito-sensei said...

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:23.461
...when he left the school.

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:28.298
He said he would
take responsibility...

00:05:28.437 --> 00:05:30.302
...and then submitted
his resignation.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.971
But publicly he denied
the relationship...

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:34.972
...with Mizuki Yokoyama.

00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:38.845
If Yokoyama-san
had said anything...

00:05:39.114 --> 00:05:40.638
...it would've
complicated things...

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.216
...but since she didn't...

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:45.377
...the matter ended
with Saito-sensei's resignation.

00:05:46.188 --> 00:05:49.157
I've never thought that he
would continue teaching...

00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:51.155
...at a different school.

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:55.823
Onizuka-sensei.

00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:57.426
It is really difficult to have
a good relationship...

00:05:57.532 --> 00:05:58.829
...between students
and their teacher.

00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:02.627
The more the teacher
is trusted by his students...

00:06:02.938 --> 00:06:05.202
...the more the students
can be hurt...

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.002
...with just one word
from the teacher.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.438
Hey! That's Saito, isn't it?

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.912
Yeah. How could
we forget Noboru Saito?!

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:15.175
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you see the news?

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:17.217
- I bet he betrayed...
- He was stabbed.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.116
...someone again
and he was attacked.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.581
It serves him right.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.756
That's right.

00:06:21.957 --> 00:06:24.221
After all, he was that kind of man.

00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:27.359
Because of him, at that time...

00:06:27.696 --> 00:06:29.527
If that's how it ends,
it's fine by me...

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.658
Miyabi's absent, isn't she...?

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.734
Are you saying Aizawa did it?!

00:06:36.838 --> 00:06:37.964
No way!

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.867
Even Aizawa... She couldn't...?

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:42.642
Can we be certain
she didn't do it?

00:06:43.044 --> 00:06:44.375
Yokoyama and Aizawa
were good friends...

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.046
...ever since they were
in elementary school...

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.580
What should we do, Kikuchi?

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:52.053
Yeah...

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:54.048
Hey, did Miyabi really do it?!

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:55.123
I'm not sure...

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.652
First, we need to investigate.

00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:00.489
Don't say anything
to Onizuka till then.

00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:01.684
Why not?

00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:03.492
If it's true, we have
to tell him right away!

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.166
Calm down, everyone.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.627
It isn't a good idea
to turn it into a big problem.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:11.172
Right?

00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:14.606
Until we find out the truth,
let's act prudently.

00:07:19.514 --> 00:07:22.506
So what's Saito's condition?

00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:26.311
According to his doctor,
it is very serious...

00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:28.517
The next few days will be key.

00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:31.153
How about the police
and the media?

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.588
I took care of them...

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.392
I don't think the matter
will attract any more attention.

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:39.157
Director.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.768
What should
we do as a response?

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.130
The issue is...

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.208
...who was the young woman
who fled from his condo?

00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:52.341
If the woman was involved
in last year's case...

00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:54.445
Well, Mizuki Yokoyama...

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.483
CLASSIFIED:
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.619
...the former student at Holy
Forest Academy in Class 2-4...

00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:00.286
...committed suicide.

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.379
Really, what a pain!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.488
She should have
been ashamed...

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:06.388
...that her indecent relationship
with her teacher was revealed.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.660
We hid the fact from the public
for them, and she responded...

00:08:09.764 --> 00:08:10.753
...by committing suicide!

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:13.766
Well, we pressured
the newspaper...

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.700
...so we don't have
to worry about that now.

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:18.737
But if we're not cautious,
we'll come off as the bad guys.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.607
Anyway, we can't do
any more harm...

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.270
...to the authority
of Japanese education.

00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:28.314
Make sure to crush
any hint of scandal.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.784
Oh, Yokoyama and Aizawa!
You're still here.

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:41.128
We're making charts
from everyone's opinions...

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:42.695
...in the class. It took
more time than we thought.

00:08:42.998 --> 00:08:45.296
All right, then. I'll help you, too.

00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:46.501
All right!

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:49.130
Teacher, sit on this side!

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.262
Oh, you were counting
on this, weren't you?!

00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:54.066
You caught us!

00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:58.570
Listen, Miyabi...

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:00.512
I...

00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:01.739
...to tell you the truth...

00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:15.785
Really?

00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:19.094
Kikuchi said not to tell anyone...

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:20.826
I have a bad feeling...

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.070
No way...

00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:24.737
Do you guys seriously think...

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:28.502
...that Aizawa was involved
in yesterday's incident?

00:09:29.044 --> 00:09:30.011
I don't know.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:34.239
But we can never
forgive Saito-sensei.

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:36.712
Everyone thinks it might...

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:39.347
Aizawa isn't home...

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.047
I'll try to find Onizuka-sensei.

00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:45.348
Fuyutsuki. You and the other
students should look for Aizawa.

00:09:46.027 --> 00:09:46.994
Yes!

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.769
Welcome!

00:09:54.869 --> 00:09:56.734
BOARD OF EDUCATION
OUTLINE AND DEVELOPMENT

00:09:59.574 --> 00:10:00.700
Thank you very much.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.672
The number you are calling...

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.181
...is out of range,
or the power is off...

00:10:09.284 --> 00:10:11.582
...and it cannot be connected.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.552
NAO KADENA

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.279
Yes.

00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:18.086
He isn't there?

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:19.226
How about his cell phone?

00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.023
The power is off...

00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:23.686
I see.

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:25.563
Yes, please do so.

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:27.793
He isn't home?

00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:30.731
No... Let's go
to Kikuchi's house then.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.008
- One beer, ma'am!
- All right!

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.303
Are you okay?

00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:41.377
Why don't you
slow down a little?

00:10:41.483 --> 00:10:43.144
Never mind. I want to drink now!

00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:44.540
What's the matter?

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:46.550
Did Fuyutsuki dump you?

00:10:47.122 --> 00:10:48.749
It's not that...

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.392
They were betrayed...

00:10:52.927 --> 00:10:54.656
...by the teacher
they had trusted.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.119
They...?

00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:58.325
The students in your class?

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:00.034
Yeah.

00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:03.399
One of the students was
seriously going out with him.

00:11:04.005 --> 00:11:05.802
But when the media found out...

00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:07.032
...he denied it...

00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:08.472
...to stay out of trouble.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.104
I guess there are a lot of
screwed-up people in the world.

00:11:12.313 --> 00:11:15.009
But I heard he was a nice guy...

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:17.817
Here! Thank you for waiting!

00:11:18.953 --> 00:11:20.181
Kikuchi? It's me.

00:11:20.822 --> 00:11:21.880
Did you find anything?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.252
I checked the records back
from when Saito was first hired...

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:25.553
...by Reimei Women's School.

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:27.354
What do you mean?

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.155
You were not there at that time.

00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:30.492
So you may not know...

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:33.226
Usually a teacher who
made the news like that...

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.033
...cannot be hired by another
private school so easily.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.873
As I thought...

00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:40.335
...he had a powerful
person recommend him.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:41.709
Who?!

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.777
Koichi Igarashi.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.909
He's the Director
of the Board of Education.

00:11:47.382 --> 00:11:48.610
At that time, Saito said...

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.249
...he was serious
about Mizuki Yokoyama.

00:11:53.188 --> 00:11:55.019
He said he knew
it wasn't allowed...

00:11:55.223 --> 00:11:58.192
...but that he would fight
whatever people said.

00:11:59.294 --> 00:12:02.559
And we believed his words.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.092
But why did he
end up betraying us?

00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:08.002
It was pressure.

00:12:08.903 --> 00:12:11.064
The reason why the relationship
between Yokoyama and Saito...

00:12:11.172 --> 00:12:12.230
...was revealed in the media...

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.571
...was that she was an excellent
student who was going...

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.706
...to represent students
at the World Conference...

00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:19.813
...to Protect Children's Rights
held in Japan last year.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.344
A well-behaved
and excellent student...

00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:26.545
...had a relationship
with her homeroom teacher.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.313
What could be a better
scandal than this for the media?

00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:30.391
But...

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.187
...the ones who
were most afraid...

00:12:32.327 --> 00:12:33.658
...that the two might
acknowledge it were...

00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:34.751
...the Board of Education...

00:12:34.863 --> 00:12:36.592
...who strongly recommended
her for the Conference.

00:12:37.432 --> 00:12:39.127
It would ruin their credibility.

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:43.329
So they talked to Saito
and made a deal.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.098
I see...

00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:49.672
Well, do you know where
I'm making this call from?

00:12:50.512 --> 00:12:52.002
I'm at a graveyard.

00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:57.277
Mizuki Yokoyama died
at the end of last year. Suicide.

00:12:57.886 --> 00:12:58.910
And one more thing...

00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:02.355
I spoke with her mother.

00:13:02.857 --> 00:13:05.883
She can think of only
one reason for the suicide.

00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:08.662
Kikuchi! Please
explain the situation.

00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:09.730
Yoshikawa!

00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:12.293
Sorry! I was worried...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.897
What on earth is going on?!

00:13:14.302 --> 00:13:15.269
Wait!

00:13:15.637 --> 00:13:16.604
Kanzaki! So what's...

00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:18.330
...the reason?

00:13:18.807 --> 00:13:22.675
Her mother said she might
have been pregnant...

00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:27.205
And the same story was told...

00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:28.404
...to Miyabi right
before the incident...

00:13:31.619 --> 00:13:34.087
No matter how much I worry
about it, there's nothing I can do.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.156
Ma'am!

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:37.781
Bring more beer, please!

00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:41.124
TEACHER FOR LIFE

00:13:48.175 --> 00:13:50.075
Hello. Murai?

00:13:50.811 --> 00:13:51.778
Where are you now?

00:13:52.412 --> 00:13:54.039
We're at the hamburger place
in front of the station.

00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:57.348
About 30 minutes ago,
a student from Class 3 saw Miyabi.

00:13:57.617 --> 00:13:58.879
She was headed to the station.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.153
That's not good...

00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:01.952
Murai, do you know where
the Metropolitan Government...

00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:03.249
...Office is? Building No.2...

00:14:03.957 --> 00:14:05.015
Yeah.

00:14:05.158 --> 00:14:07.319
The Board of Education's
office is in there.

00:14:07.427 --> 00:14:08.485
Go there right away!

00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:10.094
We have to stop Aizawa!

00:14:10.197 --> 00:14:11.164
Kikuchi.

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:15.365
You were right, we should
have let Onizuka know...

00:14:16.136 --> 00:14:18.263
Teacher.
Can you contact Onizuka?

00:14:18.738 --> 00:14:21.002
Well, it seems
his cell phone is off...

00:14:21.808 --> 00:14:22.775
Hold on!

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:24.743
Hey, are you okay?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.447
Hello.

00:14:28.148 --> 00:14:29.308
Oh, Fuyutsuki...

00:14:29.683 --> 00:14:32.151
Yes, Eikichi is here but...

00:14:32.285 --> 00:14:33.252
What?!

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.188
Ryuji! Water!

00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:43.896
More!

00:14:44.164 --> 00:14:45.563
All right...

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:46.833
Hey, Eikichi...

00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:49.534
You're a good teacher.

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:53.306
Going!

00:14:54.274 --> 00:14:55.400
Go for it!

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.012
I suppose Aizawa
somehow found out that...

00:15:00.113 --> 00:15:02.104
...Saito, whom we thought
had stopped teaching...

00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:05.377
...was still teaching.

00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.314
Also she found out that Saito
and the Board of Education...

00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:10.012
...were working hand
in hand behind our backs.

00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:13.118
She then finds out
about Yokoyama's suicide...

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:17.020
...snaps and attacks Saito.

00:15:18.064 --> 00:15:19.395
She then tries to take revenge
on the Board of Education...

00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:21.293
...who've been trying
to cover up the case.

00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:23.299
No way...

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:25.229
Who's to say they didn't?

00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:28.069
Yokoyama's suicide was
not even in the newspaper.

00:15:28.608 --> 00:15:30.007
That's why until now
even we've been...

00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:34.640
...quiet about it, but I'm sure
their power has been used...

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:36.682
For Aizawa...

00:15:37.117 --> 00:15:38.812
...they didn't just force her best
friend into committing suicide...

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:42.582
...they're also trying to erase
the existence of her friend.

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:54.893
Do you remember
Mizuki Yokoyama?

00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:57.328
Who are you?

00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:03.442
Shoot! Please be on time!

00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:07.339
I was Mizuki's best friend.

00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:10.082
Mizuki was always smiling.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.883
I loved to see her smiling.

00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:17.412
But Mizuki stopped smiling...

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.392
...after Saito betrayed her.

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.217
What are you talking about?

00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:26.729
Everyone loved Saito...

00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:29.128
Everyone...

00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:30.730
Of course, so did Mizuki.

00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:34.930
And she really fell
in love with Saito-sensei.

00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:38.438
Are you the one
who stabbed Saito-sensei?!

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:40.373
Am I right?!

00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:48.943
Where are you?!

00:16:49.522 --> 00:16:50.489
Aizawa!

00:16:50.724 --> 00:16:51.691
Aizawa!

00:16:53.793 --> 00:16:55.283
Where are you?!

00:16:56.696 --> 00:16:58.493
Stop, stop it!

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:02.794
If you did it,
you'll be finished, too!

00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:04.127
Maybe...

00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:06.136
But it's better than Mizuki.

00:17:07.007 --> 00:17:08.998
Wait! I didn't do anything!

00:17:16.816 --> 00:17:18.147
You're a punk!

00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:19.275
Onizuka!

00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:20.410
Surrender quietly!

00:17:23.423 --> 00:17:24.685
Leave me alone!
I will take this guy...

00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:25.849
Fool!

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:29.019
A kid shouldn't use a knife.

00:17:29.129 --> 00:17:30.096
Leave me alone!

00:17:30.196 --> 00:17:31.595
Hey! Wait!

00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:32.665
- Who are you?!
- Leave me alone! I'm...

00:17:32.766 --> 00:17:33.733
- Holy Forest, Class 3-4...
-...telling you to leave me alone!

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:34.800
-...a homeroom teacher...
- I don't acknowledge you...

00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:35.868
-...Eikichi Onizuka...
-...as my homeroom teacher!

00:17:36.202 --> 00:17:37.464
...22 years old.

00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:38.729
Greetings!

00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:40.339
Aizawa!

00:17:41.207 --> 00:17:42.299
Hey! This way!

00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:45.478
Leave me alone!

00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:46.943
I hate you!

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.447
I hate adults!

00:17:48.782 --> 00:17:49.806
- I don't trust adults!
- Teacher!

00:17:56.022 --> 00:17:56.989
Let's go home.

00:17:57.157 --> 00:17:58.124
Wait!

00:17:58.558 --> 00:18:01.049
That student is a suspect
in yesterday's incident.

00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:02.886
Where are you taking her?!

00:18:04.297 --> 00:18:06.788
I'm calling the police now.
Stay there!

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.890
No need for that.

00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:12.170
I'll take her into my custody
and take full responsibility.

00:18:12.672 --> 00:18:14.799
What?! What can you do?!

00:18:20.146 --> 00:18:24.139
I can do whatever I want
for my own student.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.184
You! And you call
yourself a teacher?!

00:18:26.286 --> 00:18:27.685
Do you know who I am?!

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:29.255
No!

00:18:29.923 --> 00:18:33.359
You'll pay for this!

00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:36.425
Good!

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.056
Come and get me anytime!

00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:42.327
Get on, Aizawa!

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:44.236
Get on!

00:18:44.337 --> 00:18:45.304
Onizuka-sensei!

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.006
Hey, hey...

00:18:47.107 --> 00:18:48.074
...if you kids roam around
at this time of night...

00:18:48.174 --> 00:18:49.664
...you're gonna get arrested.

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:50.743
Onizuka.

00:18:51.378 --> 00:18:52.402
Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:18:52.512 --> 00:18:53.672
Please take care of them.

00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:56.112
Onizuka-sensei,
where are you going?

00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:04.914
Hey, Eikichi!
What were you thinking?!

00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:06.215
Get out!

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:07.816
- I see.
- And take that girl with you...

00:19:07.927 --> 00:19:10.395
- I'm fine. Thanks, Kikuchi.
-...are you going to do...

00:19:10.497 --> 00:19:11.464
...something?
Are you listening to me?!

00:19:11.698 --> 00:19:13.029
- You must be feeling good.
- What?! You're kidding!

00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:15.161
You took the real
suspect to the police.

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:18.294
- What's going on?
- Did you really...

00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:19.429
- Explain it to me!
-...stab Saito?

00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:31.176
Did you?!

00:19:33.052 --> 00:19:36.078
Last week when I heard
Saito was still teaching...

00:19:36.423 --> 00:19:37.583
...I went to see
how he was doing.

00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:39.450
He was surrounded
by his students...

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.151
...and he seemed happy...

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:44.387
Imagine whatever you want.

00:19:45.064 --> 00:19:47.032
You're thinking
I did it, too, aren't you?!

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:49.494
That's fine! That's...

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.461
How long are you gonna be
stubborn about this?

00:19:54.107 --> 00:19:55.734
Keep her in there for a while.

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:57.274
Yeah... What?!

00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:01.008
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey! Hey!

00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:02.874
I'm so sorry.

00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:05.979
Anyway, that man is
vulgar, rude and vicious.

00:20:06.619 --> 00:20:07.881
It is outrageous
for him to assault...

00:20:07.987 --> 00:20:09.420
...a member
of the Board of Education.

00:20:09.522 --> 00:20:10.546
He should be condemned.

00:20:10.657 --> 00:20:11.624
He didn't assault him at all!

00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:15.349
If I wasn't assaulted,
how do you explain this?

00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:19.591
Sakurai-san.
We have two requests.

00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:21.300
One.

00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:24.834
Turn Miyabi Aizawa
in to the police.

00:20:25.638 --> 00:20:26.605
Two.

00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:29.833
Fire Onizuka immediately...

00:20:30.009 --> 00:20:32.341
...for assaulting one
of our board members.

00:20:33.713 --> 00:20:34.680
That's all.

00:20:34.781 --> 00:20:36.715
- Please wait! No way...
- Sure! That's not hard!

00:20:36.883 --> 00:20:38.077
We'll do it right away!

00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:39.273
What do you think?

00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:42.081
Onizuka, Miyabi Aizawa...

00:20:42.188 --> 00:20:43.917
We haven't been able
to reach either of them.

00:20:44.724 --> 00:20:46.089
As soon as we can contact them,
we'll listen to their explanations...

00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:48.092
...then we'll decide
what we should do.

00:20:48.194 --> 00:20:50.162
Are you accusing me of lying?

00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:53.526
There is no time for all of that!

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.258
Miyabi Aizawa admitted...

00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:57.232
...that she attacked...

00:20:57.337 --> 00:20:58.304
...Saito.

00:20:58.771 --> 00:21:02.263
You will inevitably have
to turn her in to the police!

00:21:04.177 --> 00:21:07.476
And if we don't
accept your request...

00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:09.479
...what are you going to do?

00:21:09.883 --> 00:21:14.946
I regret to say that Holy Forest's
license will be suspended.

00:21:15.088 --> 00:21:16.988
You're saying that you'll
shut down the school?

00:21:17.223 --> 00:21:18.383
No way!

00:21:18.658 --> 00:21:20.888
If that happens, my loan will be...

00:21:24.063 --> 00:21:25.325
I was trying to say it politely...

00:21:25.465 --> 00:21:27.660
...but I suppose
you didn't understand me.

00:21:28.568 --> 00:21:30.001
This is an order.

00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:32.797
Make sure it's done by tomorrow.

00:21:48.384 --> 00:21:54.948
Where is our future going?

00:21:55.058 --> 00:22:01.793
Maybe it knows of this aimless
journey and simply flew away

00:22:02.732 --> 00:22:09.069
If you can stop our gloomy days

00:22:09.872 --> 00:22:16.141
I will listen to all you say

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:23.810
However much we have,
There is always something lacking

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.288
The wind will always blow
And carry the scent away

00:22:31.427 --> 00:22:38.162
I am searching for our future now

00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:44.831
Don't laugh because
It may really go away

00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:52.577
Remember these
Strained words I say

00:22:53.649 --> 00:22:59.747
The night is almost over,
So let's run through this moment

00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:02.985
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:07.089
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:11.058
Before the endless night begins

00:23:11.567 --> 00:23:15.663
Embrace this precious night

00:23:16.806 --> 00:23:18.364
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:18.474 --> 00:23:19.702
Effective immediately, I suspend
the operational license...

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.140
...of Holy Forest Academy.

00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:27.043
Take me to Onizuka.

00:23:27.383 --> 00:23:28.350
Quickly!

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.444
Please don't go...

00:23:34.157 --> 00:23:35.419
No! No!

00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:37.320
I won't let it happen! Principal!

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.925
I won't let my little bit
of happiness be ruined!

00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:44.561
I am the one who stabbed him...

00:23:44.767 --> 00:23:46.564
...Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old!

00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:54.709
SEE YA NEXT TIME
