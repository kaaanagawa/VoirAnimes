WEBVTT

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.039
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:27.344
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:32.419
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:38.158
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.931
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.900
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.976
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.245 --> 00:01:00.774
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:04.448
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:08.113
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:13.327
Toward the finish line

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:46.039
Listen up! A home visit by
a teacher starts tomorrow.

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:50.041
That bastard Onizuka will come
to our homes anytime.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:54.614
But we can't acknowledge that
bastard as our homeroom teacher.

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:57.980
None of us will let him in our homes.

00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:03.181
If your parent lets him in, harass
him so that he will leave soon.

00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.325
Do you understand?

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:12.963
It's just a home visit. Why is he
so upset about it? Funny guy.

00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:16.831
Isn't it because Murai's mother is--?

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.198
-You will cooperate, won't you?
-I will, I will.

00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:24.009
Okay.

00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:33.544
That Onizuka. I will never let him
pay a home visit to my house!

00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:46.828
Regarding the home visits
to students' homes tomorrow--

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:50.267
Home visits? It's too much hassle.

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.437
Then you aren't going?

00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.077
I see parents at
teacher-parent conferences anyway.

00:02:56.278 --> 00:03:00.840
Why do I need to go out of my way
to meet with women in their 40s?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.951
That sounds reasonable.
You aren't the type for home visits.

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.486
Cut it out.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.128
I'm pretty sure Murai's mother
is still in her 20s.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.497
That's right.
She is also hot and single--

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.228
What did you say?!
Is it true?! Answer me!

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.599
It's true.

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:33.109
Sexier than Ever!
Bewitching Bunny

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.141
Not yet? Where is Murai's young mom?

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.981
Instead of this, you can
officially visit her home.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.353
Not until I see whether
she is stunning or not.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.656
Students like you haven't had
enough life experiences...

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:53.961
...to know what real beauties
look like. Hey, where is her photo?

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.729
During the school sports festival...

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.773
...I think had one
that focused on her....

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:03.274
-What?
-You are a man too.

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:07.111
-It's not that--
-Let me see the whole thing.

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:09.307
No. I'll take it out.

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:11.349
Raw Sexual Massage

00:04:19.328 --> 00:04:22.923
She is really hot!

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:28.426
-What are you doing?!
-That's my line.

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.365
Why are you staring at my photo
in such a weird position?

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:36.077
Wow, the real thing!

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.547
-Teacher.
-Teacher?

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.482
It's so noisy out here.
What's going on?

00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:54.424
Hey, Mom! Why are you
staring into space?

00:04:59.802 --> 00:05:04.205
Isn't he a student at your school?
Didn't he say "teacher"?

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:07.207
Maybe a teacher at a cram school.

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.607
By the way, I'm hungry.
Could you make me dinner soon?

00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:16.251
Oh, it's this late.
Sorry, I'll get it right away.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.444
Shit! He saw my mom.

00:05:19.655 --> 00:05:22.988
Now, he will come visit us.
He'll come definitely.

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:25.956
Hello there! This is a home visit!

00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:29.289
I'm sorry, but Kunio is not home yet.

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:35.198
Oh, that's not a problem.
Let's talk about grownup stuff.

00:05:35.404 --> 00:05:37.702
And then, and then....

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:42.707
As a single mother you raised him
by yourself. It must be tough.

00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:45.277
Yes. He's been a handful.

00:05:45.848 --> 00:05:50.410
But from now on,
I will become his father.

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:54.680
No, it's not right.
You're his teacher, and I'm his parent.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.851
When we take everything off,
we are just a man and a woman.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.528
That line makes me melt.

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.863
Very good!

00:06:13.008 --> 00:06:15.841
What are you doing, Kunio?

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.315
He has such a dirty mind. He will
definitely come to our house first.

00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:31.083
Shit! What should I do?

00:06:31.793 --> 00:06:36.162
Hey, everyone! I heard there were
no home visits for our class!

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:38.026
-What?
-Are you sure?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.996
Yeah. I heard other teachers talking
about it in the teachers' lounge.

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:48.074
-How come?
-Whatever it is, we lucked out.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.035
Murai, come here for a second.

00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:54.611
What did you say? Are you sure?

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:58.149
It was too dark to see clearly.
Right, Saeko?

00:06:58.353 --> 00:07:01.880
Right. I'm sure it was
Onizuka and your mother.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.459
She did get a call last night
and was gone for a while.

00:07:06.662 --> 00:07:10.655
If it's true, we smell something here.
They seemed close.

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:14.927
Your mother would hit it off
with Onizuka--

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.871
I will never let
that bastard have my mother!

00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:23.175
No matter what happens,
never betray us...

00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:25.505
...like Kikuchi and Yoshikawa.

00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:30.014
-I know.
-I sure hope so.

00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:43.663
Home visits by a teacher
are nothing but a formality.

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:47.135
So it doesn't matter
if I do it or not.

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:52.165
I sure hope my mother wouldn't
fall for this dumb guy.

00:07:52.374 --> 00:07:55.832
But she doesn't have
good eyes to evaluate guys.

00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:59.741
This is why there are
no home visits for our class.

00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:02.041
Make up excuses for your parents.

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.479
Murai, aren't you gonna come with me?

00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:12.120
No, I'll pass today. Sorry.

00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:20.830
Mom!

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:26.474
Oh, Kunio. You just got home?
Just in time. I'll be gone for a bit.

00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:29.838
Mom, look at what you're wearing....

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:34.539
Don't I look good?
I don't look like your mother, do I?

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.481
Where in the world are you
going in such an outfit?

00:08:39.454 --> 00:08:41.388
On a date.

00:08:42.324 --> 00:08:47.455
I might be late. So order
whatever you like for dinner.

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:53.896
Did you say a date?

00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:00.603
Don't tell me....

00:09:09.951 --> 00:09:13.079
I don't think so,
but I hope her date isn't...

00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:16.013
... that dumb guy.

00:09:18.193 --> 00:09:20.457
Who the hell is that?

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:26.764
No sweat. He was just
trying to pick her up.

00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:32.667
That's someone from her work.

00:09:32.874 --> 00:09:37.937
Mom made me nervous. She was
just meeting her female co-worker.

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:40.239
I thought she was meeting Onizuka.

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:45.648
Mother! Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:09:45.854 --> 00:09:48.755
-What?
-You are late.

00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:52.518
The thought of going out
with you made me so excited...

00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:58.427
...I had to do this and that.
Well, we don't wanna talk standing.

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:06.235
Onizuka!

00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:08.500
Okonomi-yaki Teppan-yaki:
Miyaji

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.243
He was born
when I was in eighth grade.

00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:15.348
Eighth grade? Eighth grade is....

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.017
Thirteen years old.

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:22.782
Back then, I was determined
to give birth to my baby.

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:27.394
That's amazing. You thought
that way when you were only 13.

00:10:27.596 --> 00:10:30.588
But it was pretty tough after that.

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:35.236
When they found out I was pregnant,
my boyfriend left...

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:37.598
...and my parents disowned me.

00:10:38.807 --> 00:10:44.871
So I left home, came to Tokyo and
started living in a tiny apartment.

00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:47.110
That's probably why...

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:51.775
...my son hasn't been able
to trust grown men.

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:56.651
He runs away from tough situations.
Just like adults do, he thinks.

00:10:56.858 --> 00:11:00.760
Whenever things get too tough,
he runs away from it?

00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:06.229
But that is to be expected
because he's never had a father.

00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:10.964
Shit, I wish I could hear
what they're talking about.

00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:16.338
Excuse me. Are you ready
for more orders?

00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:19.070
Oh, no. I'm fine with this.

00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:22.011
Unfortunately, that's not
how it works.

00:11:22.217 --> 00:11:26.586
We can't allow you to order one juice
and stay for hours!

00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:30.053
If I ordered a juice, I'm a customer!

00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:34.285
Kunio! What the hell
are you doing here?

00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:35.860
Shit!

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:41.500
He was so worried about
his mother that he followed her.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:46.072
He was a "tail" boy
instead of a "fail" boy!

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:52.711
That was a funny rhyme, wasn't it?
"Tail" instead of "fail"--

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:57.783
I just happened to walk by!
What are you doing with this guy?

00:11:58.453 --> 00:12:03.618
Why are you calling him a guy?
He's your homeroom teacher! Apologize.

00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:06.885
I'm not gonna apologize to this guy!

00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:09.529
You're so naive.
That's why men betray you!

00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:13.030
I won't console you when it goes bad.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.360
Kunio!

00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:27.515
That bastard really pisses me off!

00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:30.549
"A tail boy"? What a joke!

00:12:30.988 --> 00:12:36.824
I just wanna kill that bastard!
Don't you agree, Fujiyoshi?

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.963
-So you left them alone and came back?
-Yeah.

00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:44.328
That's the worst thing
you could have done.

00:12:44.535 --> 00:12:48.665
Because your mother said
she was going on a date, right?

00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:54.868
When adults go on a date, they usually
go to a certain place after a meal.

00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:59.014
-A certain place?
-Hotel. A Love Hotel.

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:02.083
Love Hotel

00:13:03.587 --> 00:13:09.048
That bastard Onizuka! I'm gonna
kill him if he ever touches my mom!

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:11.124
Okonomi-yaki Teppan-yaki:
Miyaji

00:13:11.328 --> 00:13:13.990
They left a while ago in a good mood.

00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:16.132
Miyaji

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:20.064
They were going to the next place.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.635
Hotel New York

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:27.038
It can't be.
My mom and Onizuka....

00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.476
What if they make a baby together?

00:13:31.515 --> 00:13:34.712
See, Kunio? This is your baby sister.

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:38.684
And, Kunio, I'm your new dad!

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:42.882
From now on, your name
will be Kunio Onizuka!

00:13:43.994 --> 00:13:46.053
Kunio Onizuka

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:49.994
No! That blond bastard!

00:13:50.234 --> 00:13:53.465
I'm gonna kill him!

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:57.907
You bumped into me and you're
gonna leave without a word?

00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:01.707
Who did you say you were gonna kill?

00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:04.880
Wait! You bastard punk!

00:14:21.598 --> 00:14:23.293
Mom?

00:14:43.687 --> 00:14:48.784
Really? She came home. That's good.

00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:52.655
Yeah. My mom wasn't stupid.

00:14:52.863 --> 00:14:55.457
But there's no proof of what happened.

00:14:55.666 --> 00:15:00.160
Aizawa, did you want
something to happen?

00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:04.803
It's not that. I don't care
about what happened.

00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:09.445
But if there was such a rumor,
that's an excuse to expel him.

00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:13.946
A perverted teacher who flirts
with his student's mother!

00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:17.279
-That's a great idea!
-Isn't it?

00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:21.721
Don't! Don't use my mom.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:26.862
Even if it's for the sake of
our class, I won't let that happen!

00:15:27.064 --> 00:15:28.122
Murai.

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:32.157
I'll come up with something
for the Onizuka situation.

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:36.396
-So don't hurt my mom!
-Murai.

00:15:36.607 --> 00:15:40.304
-Let's go, Saeko.
-Okay.

00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:46.172
-Miyabi....
-So he was a wimp too, after all.

00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:50.985
-Hey! Come here!
-What?

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:01.888
Is that his bathing place?

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:03.361
Here we go.

00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:10.430
He sprayed a pheromone perfume
in his crotch!

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:15.669
He must be going on a date.
He wants to get lucky tonight!

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:19.371
-That dork!
-Murai!

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:22.609
-Hey, Onizuka!
-What?

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.957
If you want to date my mother,
you need to beat me!

00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:30.554
Fine with me.

00:16:47.377 --> 00:16:51.473
I once was a champion at
a competition in Ikebukuro.

00:16:51.682 --> 00:16:53.877
I'll win this one!

00:16:54.785 --> 00:16:57.413
A national competition? Impressive.

00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:02.752
Just because you ride a real motorbike
doesn't mean you can be so relaxed!

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:06.122
I'm gonna beat you in no time!

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.527
So sorry! You need to
cancel your date today!

00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:16.467
Here I go!

00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:23.235
Onizuka is catching up
with amazing speed!

00:17:23.447 --> 00:17:27.543
-Murai in a pinch!
-What?!

00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:32.749
What a dirty trick, hiding your cards!

00:17:32.956 --> 00:17:34.150
Justice

00:17:34.357 --> 00:17:37.224
I gave you a handicap.
Or there'd be no competition.

00:17:37.427 --> 00:17:39.588
Who do you think you are?

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:46.560
How about this? What?!

00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:52.199
You won a national competition?
What a petty reason to be merry!

00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:56.140
I'll teach you that
there's always someone above you!

00:17:56.346 --> 00:18:00.646
Shit! I can't let him pass!
I'll never let him pass me!

00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:03.081
You are so easy!

00:18:03.553 --> 00:18:05.418
What?

00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:09.349
It can't be!

00:18:14.097 --> 00:18:15.758
All right!

00:18:17.134 --> 00:18:18.761
Well...

00:18:19.302 --> 00:18:24.001
...a promise is a promise.
I'm going on a date.

00:18:26.443 --> 00:18:28.411
Teacher....

00:18:31.815 --> 00:18:34.249
You finally give up.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.744
What?

00:18:37.954 --> 00:18:41.549
Idiot! Why would I want
to shake hands with you?

00:18:41.758 --> 00:18:44.591
I won't allow you to go on a date!

00:18:44.861 --> 00:18:49.525
Hey, you guys! Wait! Murai!

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:53.595
Hey, Murai. Don't you think
you went too far?

00:18:53.804 --> 00:18:58.070
-I don't care! That bastard!
-Wait!

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.038
That voice....

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.301
Wait!

00:19:02.512 --> 00:19:05.913
If you don't, I'm gonna
kill you little devils!

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:09.044
-Onizuka!
-What is he, a monster?

00:19:09.252 --> 00:19:14.246
Give me the key. The key!
I can't go on a date with this thing!

00:19:14.658 --> 00:19:18.150
I've already told you,
I won't let you go!

00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:27.802
Kunio!

00:19:28.705 --> 00:19:31.503
-Mom!
-Wait, you bastards!

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:34.677
Get on! Hurry up!

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:47.613
-It's you, Mother!
-Teacher!

00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:51.225
-Thank you for last night.
-Thank you.

00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:54.488
Don't talk to that guy!

00:19:54.698 --> 00:20:00.000
I'll protect you forever, Mom.
Don't count on such a flaky bastard!

00:20:00.537 --> 00:20:05.702
-Murai, don't make me laugh!
-Teacher!

00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:10.403
You can't accept that you lost.
When things go wrong, you run away.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.740
You're acting just like
the grownups you hate!

00:20:15.952 --> 00:20:20.116
Do you think such a wimp
could protect a woman?

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.624
Shut up! Shut up!

00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:36.698
Mom!

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.638
You idiot! Watch out!

00:20:46.449 --> 00:20:50.579
-Are you all right?
-Yes, thank you.

00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:56.455
-Mom....
-Kunio! Are you all right?

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.462
Listen, Murai. To protect someone
means risking your own life.

00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:06.966
You can't do it half-heartedly.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.840
Now, time for a date.

00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:15.443
Mother, see you later.

00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:20.639
-Have fun!
-He said a date. Who's he going with?

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.751
Someone's mother in your class.

00:21:24.321 --> 00:21:29.258
Well, the next one is
your mother, Kusano.

00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:34.828
He calls it "A Dating-style Home Visit
by a Teacher: Together With Mother."

00:21:35.031 --> 00:21:37.761
-What?
-Well, that's what it is.

00:21:37.968 --> 00:21:41.199
See you. I don't wanna be late.

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:45.831
A regular home visit is
nothing but a formality.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.541
He couldn't get to know
the parents in such a setting.

00:21:50.747 --> 00:21:53.079
He is truly unique and strange.

00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:57.246
-That guy....
-He has such a unique perspective.

00:21:57.454 --> 00:22:01.049
He wanted my opinion
the day before yesterday.

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:04.459
What about setting it up as a date?

00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:08.358
That's sounds cool!
I totally agree with you.

00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:14.626
So, I was the first one yesterday.
We had drinks at the first place...

00:22:14.838 --> 00:22:18.069
...but we only talked
about you after that.

00:22:18.274 --> 00:22:20.299
Such a thing....

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.210
How can I believe such a thing?

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:27.179
He's Onizuka! That perverted teacher!

00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:30.911
There's no doubt that
he was only after your body!

00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:34.557
He doesn't really care
about home visits!

00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:43.698
When did you start
thinking like a loser?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.194
You say that because you don't
know how he is most of the time.

00:22:49.873 --> 00:22:55.470
No matter how he normally is,
he does what he needs to do.

00:22:55.678 --> 00:23:00.115
That's how a man should really be.

00:23:01.217 --> 00:23:02.775
Mom....

00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:09.050
You saw him when he saved me,
didn't you?

00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:15.897
That guy, that guy....

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:19.535
I will never acknowledge him! Never!

00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:23.438
-Murai!
-Hey, wait!

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:45.653
You and me, let's go away

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:50.887
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:55.933
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:01.870
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:06.273
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:11.485
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.253 --> 00:24:17.088
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:21.690
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:32.498
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.074 --> 00:24:42.472
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:42.683 --> 00:24:46.915
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:51.989
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:57.094
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.331 --> 00:25:03.668
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:14.548 --> 00:25:16.140
Next Episode

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.581
If I jump, I'll never
let you touch my mother!

00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:34.263
Doraemon

00:25:35.603 --> 00:25:39.198
If I were a teacher, I'd
probably tell you guys this:

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.542
You should be man enough
to sow your own seeds.
