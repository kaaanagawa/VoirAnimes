All right. That's it for today.
Don't forget to review, okay?

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:46.845
Yes.

00:01:47.318 --> 00:01:49.309
It'll be on your test.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.999
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:54.262
You live alone, right?

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:55.703
Yeah. So?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.667
Can I come by your place
sometime?

00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:01.357
Well, I don't know.
My home is a mess.

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:03.917
No problem.
I have questions...

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.218
Don't make any plans by yourself.

00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:10.687
If you're going, I'll go, too.

00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:20.125
That's enough.
Don't tease me like that.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.927
Remember, I'm your teacher.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.629
- I'm serious, man.
- Can we go?

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:37.422
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:40.482
I've heard
you're very popular with the boys.

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.659
That's not true.

00:02:42.894 --> 00:02:49.800
Don't be modest. I've heard all
the boys get studious in your class.

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:53.862
But they give me a hard time.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:58.602
Because you're young and cute.
I'm called "Chihuahua."

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.338
I was miserable
at the last Nelton Party, too...

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:05.277
This world is so unfair...

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:09.178
It's not like that, Kochatani-sensei.

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:13.352
How can you say that?
You must be very, very happy.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:14.482
What?

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:15.786
Nothing.

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.862
You'd better be careful.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.867
Nowadays, students are forward.
You never know what they are up to.

00:03:24.102 --> 00:03:25.228
What?

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:29.966
It may happen. "Female teacher
falls in love with her student."

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.906
A FEMALE TEACHER RAN AWAY
WITH HER LOVER STUDENT

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:36.470
What? Who's hitting on her?

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:37.878
Onizuka!

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.179
Your face is red.
And you smell like alcohol!

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:42.183
Eikichi Onizuka.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.179
Nice to meet you.

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:50.288
So who's hitting on Fuyutsuki?

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:52.619
Is it you?

00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:53.755
You?

00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:55.761
No one!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.230
You misheard, Onizuka-sensei.

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:03.772
You could have
a great guy like me...

00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:08.175
...but you're saying you've made out
with one of your students?

00:04:09.113 --> 00:04:11.513
I'm sad.

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:14.276
As a teacher.

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:24.418
Sannomaru's prediction
can come true.

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.959
Vice Principal!

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:32.097
If you get excited so easily
by those boys...

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.571
...you'll be punished.

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.434
I am not carried away by them.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.243
Okay, fine.

00:04:40.778 --> 00:04:43.941
The fact that
the boys tease you implies...

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:47.610
...you're accepting their advances.

00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:53.190
You need to draw a line
between the teacher and students.

00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:59.792
Be careful. I don't want you to get
a virus from a loose teacher here.

00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:02.089
Wow! That..!

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.430
What?

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:08.198
What are you doing?
No violence.

00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:14.108
Do you know
who you are doing this to?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.445
Onizuka...

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.687
There's a string on your forehead.

00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:25.017
Ouch!

00:05:26.457 --> 00:05:28.322
It's your hair!

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:32.692
That's the last piece.
It was still stuck to your head.

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:35.889
You! I'm gonna sue you!

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:39.466
I made a mistake.
Don't get so upset.

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:41.300
My last hair. Put it back!

00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:43.169
I told you, I didn't mean it.

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:45.636
Return my hair!

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.143
Have I let my guard down?

00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:48.371
Ouch!

00:05:48.646 --> 00:05:49.806
Where did you throw it?

00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.508
No one cares about just one hair.

00:05:51.582 --> 00:05:53.743
That one makes a big difference.

00:05:53.818 --> 00:05:56.116
Should I draw your hair
with this marker?

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:57.415
Don't be stupid!

00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:22.946
FACULTY RESTROOM

00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:27.277
I thought
I'd be used to teaching by now.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.220
I guess all the girls hate me.

00:06:37.328 --> 00:06:39.819
Excuse me.
Hey, is somebody there?

00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.364
Who is it? Open the door!

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:45.766
Don't get carried away
with the boys.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.267
Pig!

00:06:47.572 --> 00:06:51.668
Listen! All the girls hate you.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.704
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting carried away!

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:59.077
If you have a problem, I can listen.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.742
Who do you think you are?

00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:04.447
You think you're a teacher?
We see how you attract the boys.

00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:07.422
Don't act like you're our teacher.

00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:10.157
No one thinks you're our teacher.

00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:12.889
You're just a woman
who makes us sick!

00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:15.995
You should quit teaching!

00:07:19.637 --> 00:07:21.036
Here you go!

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:29.836
- Damn you!
- Bitch!

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:37.050
This isn't the first time.
There have been several things...

00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:44.357
I couldn't find my shoes one time.
My chalk was broken into pieces.

00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:48.125
I've received voice messages
saying "die" with a female voice.

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:50.733
They're so immature.

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:56.704
You should kick their asses.

00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:59.470
I can't do it like you.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:06.578
You're starting to handle
the infamous Class 3-4.

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:12.384
But I may not be talented enough
to handle a class with 40 students.

00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:18.985
If you don't like it,
isn't it better to quit...

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.491
...teaching?

00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:22.690
What?

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:25.028
You can't handle the students...

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:27.002
... if you get depressed
over stupid things.

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.034
Unless you enjoy teaching...

00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:34.203
...you'll be stressed out
and become big and fat.

00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:38.964
I don't want to see you at 300 pounds.

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.205
No way.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.908
Damn you!

00:08:48.415 --> 00:08:50.508
We have so much snow here now.

00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:53.950
We made a snowman.

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.319
I sent photos. Please take a look.

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:10.228
You've finally become a teacher!
Teacher is so happy about this.

00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:15.106
She is so proud of you!

00:09:16.176 --> 00:09:21.204
I'm so glad. We're behind you!
Hitomi Kizaki.

00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:29.452
That's right.

00:09:29.957 --> 00:09:33.449
I can't be a teacher
if I get depressed about this.

00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:36.523
I'm a teacher now.

00:09:37.464 --> 00:09:43.198
Finally I've become a teacher.
I'll do my best, like Onizuka.

00:09:44.137 --> 00:09:45.604
Good morning!

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:47.697
GET FIRED. GO AWAY.

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:48.798
YOU HAVE V.D.
GO TO HELL.

00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:55.712
We didn't do this.
The girls drew these.

00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:59.012
They used crayons,
so it's hard to erase them.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.653
They said
they're boycotting your class.

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:04.587
As long as you're a teacher...

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:06.717
...they said
they wouldn't come to class.

00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:08.590
They're stupid.

00:10:08.762 --> 00:10:12.528
Don't worry. They're jealous
because you're so cute.

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:17.898
Since they're gone, let's cancel
the class and play a game.

00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:21.097
Sounds good. Or do you want
to go to Karaoke? Or a movie?

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:22.971
GET FIRED.
YOU HAVE V.D.

00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:25.273
Why don't you tell us
about yourself?

00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:27.242
When was your first kiss?

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:28.941
GO TO HELL.
YOU'RE A PORNO ACTRESS. BITCH.

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:30.881
When did you lose
your virginity?

00:10:31.018 --> 00:10:33.578
Are you a virgin?

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:35.622
Can we call you Azusa?

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.554
That doesn't sound right
for a teacher.

00:10:54.662 --> 00:10:55.796
FACULTY ROOM

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:58.024
Fuyutsuki disappeared?

00:10:59.564 --> 00:11:01.861
Onizuka! Here are the prints.

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:09.630
Search, search, keep on searching!
Let's find a clue!

00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.430
Breaking into a house is a crime.

00:11:13.503 --> 00:11:19.904
You exaggerate way too much.
It's over-thinking, isn't it?!

00:11:20.005 --> 00:11:23.200
Why did you have
to involve us with this?

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.371
I just ran into you guys.
I thought you could help me.

00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:29.806
I'm certain she's gone
to kill herself.

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:32.068
Find out where she went.

00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:35.838
So what are you doing?

00:11:36.078 --> 00:11:37.942
Don't take advantage
of this confusion...

00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:39.035
... by wearing her underwear.

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:41.203
It's all my fault.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.473
Isn't it better to quit teaching?

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:47.579
Because I said so.

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:51.341
I have to go to class soon.

00:11:51.584 --> 00:11:54.949
Lesson? I can give you a lesson.

00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:56.144
Dancing...

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.186
...singing...

00:11:57.253 --> 00:11:59.482
... poetry, limbo dancing.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.684
Limbo dancing?

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.918
- What's this...?
- What?

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.551
Sounds like she worked
at a Bed and Breakfast in Hakuba...

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:11.420
...while she was in school.

00:12:11.492 --> 00:12:14.425
She was exchanging letters
with the daughter at the B&amp;B.

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:20.024
That's it!

00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:23.118
Let's go. Let's go to Hakuba!

00:12:43.404 --> 00:12:45.166
Oops. I did it again.

00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:47.302
You're bad.

00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:50.004
Relax. Play slowly. That's the key.

00:13:01.878 --> 00:13:05.744
HAKUBA WELCOME
STATION TO HAKUBA

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.346
Hey. Hey. Why are we doing this?

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:09.641
That's how it goes.

00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:13.340
How can you stay calm?
This is Hakuba. Hakuba!

00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:19.779
It's cool. By the way...

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:21.650
...where is Onizuka?

00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:29.312
Hey!

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:35.318
Idiots!
What would you do without me?

00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:57.257
The school has been closed?

00:14:07.203 --> 00:14:08.567
Hitomi.

00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:10.335
Azusa.

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:14.078
Long time no see.
Thank you for all your letters.

00:14:14.894 --> 00:14:17.052
But I haven't heard
from you in a while...

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:18.903
...and I was getting a little worried.

00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.090
I'm glad to see you look fine.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.944
You're in high school now.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.037
Back then
you were still carrying a kid's bag.

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:26.560
What do you want?

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:31.432
I don't want to talk to a teacher.

00:14:31.501 --> 00:14:33.694
Hitomi. What's the matter?

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:36.360
Hitomi, wait!

00:14:36.636 --> 00:14:41.934
I hate teachers!

00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:43.963
Hitomi!

00:14:48.474 --> 00:14:49.963
Got you!

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.466
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.370
Fuyutsuki!

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.866
Fuyutsuki, Fuyutsuki.
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:02.876
Don't be stupid.
Do you understand?

00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:07.706
I'm so relieved.

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:09.446
Onizuka.

00:15:10.982 --> 00:15:12.949
What do you want to do, jerk?

00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:20.480
Sorry. I apologize.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.848
Under the circumstances
if you disappeared...

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.319
...everyone would be worried
about you.

00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:30.283
I will buy dinner next time.
Please forgive me.

00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:33.120
Well, I'm glad I was in time.

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:36.790
I guess you can say
I saved your life.

00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:42.251
I had no intention
of killing myself, though.

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:46.520
I think Onizuka is threatening her.

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:49.257
He was so nervous
a few minutes ago.

00:15:50.097 --> 00:15:52.792
- That's right.
- How about your lesson?

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:58.528
Lesson? Onizuka will give it to me.
Talk to you later.

00:15:58.634 --> 00:15:59.600
Tomoko?!

00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:03.430
What are we going to do?

00:16:04.503 --> 00:16:06.732
Why don't you stay here tonight?

00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:09.827
Fuyutsuki told me to tell you so.

00:16:10.506 --> 00:16:16.702
This is my B&amp;B.
I can't say no to her.

00:16:18.709 --> 00:16:22.608
If you run to Hakuba
every time you go nuts at school...

00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:25.200
...the commute will break you.

00:16:25.277 --> 00:16:28.972
What does this place mean to you?

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:34.945
This is where I made my decision
to be a teacher.

00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:38.648
I was working at this B&amp;B
during the summer...

00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:40.410
...while I was in college.

00:16:40.617 --> 00:16:43.709
The girl you met was Hitomi.

00:16:44.085 --> 00:16:46.881
The owner's daughter, right?

00:16:47.286 --> 00:16:49.116
How did you know?

00:16:49.354 --> 00:16:52.843
Her letters.
They were all over your desk.

00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:53.910
What?

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:57.887
I didn't take the opportunity
to steal your panties.

00:16:57.956 --> 00:17:00.446
What's this?

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:05.354
Sorry.
We broke your window going in.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.923
That's okay.
Thank you for your concern.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.152
Well...

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:14.927
I enjoyed that time very much.

00:17:15.364 --> 00:17:18.729
Coincidentally, one of the older
students in my college...

00:17:18.798 --> 00:17:20.765
...Senpai, became a teacher...

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.958
...and was hired
at an elementary school here.

00:17:23.966 --> 00:17:27.730
One day, Hitomi took me to her school.

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:30.993
Everyone loved the teacher.

00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:35.330
I started helping her. That was fun.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:39.905
While I was watching Senpai,
Hitomi, and others...

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:47.134
You wanted to be a teacher
after this?

00:17:52.877 --> 00:17:56.072
After my female students
wouldn't come to class...

00:17:56.145 --> 00:17:58.806
... I was thinking about
what I'm doing.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.472
It made me really want
to come here.

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:05.674
Onizuka,
what does being a teacher mean?

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.207
I was trying so hard.

00:18:08.284 --> 00:18:12.116
I checked on every student's
hobby and favorite TV star.

00:18:12.186 --> 00:18:17.552
I tried to understand them.
I don't know what to do anymore.

00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:22.111
I don't know. I've never put
that much thought into it.

00:18:22.222 --> 00:18:25.678
I envy you, Onizuka.
You have no worries.

00:18:26.024 --> 00:18:28.957
Oh, I have many worries.

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:32.854
Like having only 50 yen left
before payday.

00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:35.587
That's not what you meant?

00:18:35.894 --> 00:18:39.453
I was hoping I would feel better
if I saw Hitomi.

00:18:39.696 --> 00:18:41.958
But something is wrong.

00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:46.792
She told me
she doesn't want to talk to a teacher.

00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:53.498
I wonder why. All of the good things
from the past are falling apart.

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:57.427
Okay. Let me talk to her.

00:18:57.802 --> 00:18:58.769
What?

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.098
Count on me.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.363
Wait, Onizuka!

00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:04.260
Where is your daughter?

00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:08.436
I think she's at our main house.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.539
Onizuka!

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.232
What's next?

00:19:21.712 --> 00:19:24.975
Hey, are you the brat
who doesn't like teachers?

00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:26.604
Could you tell me who you are?

00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:30.842
Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old.
I am the greatest teacher in Japan!

00:19:31.015 --> 00:19:32.709
Onizuka! Stop it.

00:19:33.316 --> 00:19:35.647
Are you also a teacher?

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.215
Get out of my house.
I don't want to talk to any teachers.

00:19:38.284 --> 00:19:39.615
- Hitomi.
- Go home!

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:41.549
No, I won't.

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:43.279
Why don't you like teachers?

00:19:43.653 --> 00:19:45.279
Tell me why!

00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:50.147
Sure. I'll tell you why.

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:53.122
We were abandoned
by Sagara-sensei.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.586
What?

00:19:54.657 --> 00:19:57.681
She was having an affair
with another teacher.

00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:58.952
Affair?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.117
- Are you kidding?
- No.

00:20:01.527 --> 00:20:04.494
She did something
she shouldn't have done.

00:20:04.795 --> 00:20:07.160
You call yourself a teacher?

00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:11.662
How could you make us
support your affair...

00:20:11.764 --> 00:20:14.492
...with a married man in this school?

00:20:15.699 --> 00:20:18.825
Are you saying
a teacher can't be in love?

00:20:19.434 --> 00:20:22.026
Are you going to justify
what you did?

00:20:22.502 --> 00:20:24.833
What are you going to tell the kids?

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:28.170
I have no intention
of making any excuses.

00:20:28.238 --> 00:20:30.864
I'll just tell them the facts
as they are.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.529
What were you thinking?

00:20:32.639 --> 00:20:35.800
Principal, fire her now!

00:20:36.607 --> 00:20:38.403
So Sagara-sensei was...

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:41.873
We were her last students
before the school closed.

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:44.807
She quit teaching school
before we graduated.

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:47.003
She must have gone
somewhere with him.

00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:49.305
She's that kind of person.

00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:52.873
Tomorrow the school will be gone.
Demolished.

00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:54.708
What do you mean?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.304
The school will be blown up
for a film.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.939
That'll give me a break.

00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:01.875
Stupid.

00:21:02.317 --> 00:21:06.341
Don't pout over such a thing.
A teacher is human, too.

00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:09.442
There's nothing wrong
with her loving someone.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.487
Onizuka!

00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:13.783
Don't talk like that
without thinking of her feelings.

00:21:13.854 --> 00:21:15.753
Her feelings?

00:21:16.155 --> 00:21:19.611
How about his wife's, child's,
and our feelings?!

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.248
She is the one who doesn't care
about people's feelings!

00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:24.654
She's just selfish.

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:31.290
That's why!
That's why I hate teachers!

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.903
Subete no hito wo aiseru wake ja

00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:56.135

NEXT EPISODE

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.828
The demolition is going to start.

00:23:26.468 --> 00:23:30.404
If not blown to pieces,
then vaporized.

00:23:33.075 --> 00:23:34.440
The other end!

00:23:36.178 --> 00:23:37.611
Wait for me.
