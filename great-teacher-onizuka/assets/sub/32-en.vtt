WEBVTT

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.444
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:14.016
I don't just feel it

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:20.432
This street makes me love

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.168
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.173
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:35.750
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:40.390
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:45.957
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:51.600
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:57.807
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:03.174
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:08.341
I decided I won’t do
What I can't put into words

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:16.222
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.692
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:23.165
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:46.192
So is Onizuka
making enough money?

00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:48.732
I've heard that
he's not even close.

00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:51.966
I figured that it would
be impossible.

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.833
Demands to fire him
will swarm the school.

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:01.772
He deserves it.
He stole the money.

00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:03.574
And then he showed off.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:09.921
Come on in!

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:12.115
RAFFLE DRAWING

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:13.782
RAFFLE TICKET
PRIZE VALUE 80 MILLION YEN

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.893
A raffle ticket?

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:20.866
Hello!

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.230
I thought it was you.

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:25.592
What do you want?

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.530
Is that any way to greet...

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.138
...your friend since
elementary school?

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.339
I never expected
you to go this far.

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.441
Someone sweet like you
who lives in such a nice house...

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.546
...has done this much.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.112
Such a nice house?

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.580
Your father is
the manager of a bank...

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:46.892
...and your mother is
a happy housewife.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.924
You live in a reasonably big house.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.787
You are a typical daughter...

00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:54.559
...from a happy, upper-
middle-class family.

00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:58.331
I wonder how a girl
who looks so happy...

00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.968
...can keep so much
anger bottled up.

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:03.765
What don't you understand?

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:06.234
This is about revenge.

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.503
Revenge for our friend...

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.945
...who trusted a teacher
and was betrayed...

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:12.640
...and had to leave our school.

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:15.880
Because of the homeroom
teacher's betrayal...

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:18.420
...we lost our classmate.

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:20.417
I won't forgive him.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:21.493
Ever!

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:24.722
I guess it all happened.

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:28.232
Since I wasn't
going to school then...

00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:30.063
...I couldn't tell you about it.

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.258
Don't play innocent with me!

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.697
You know about everything!

00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:34.830
I guess it doesn't really matter.

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.133
It does matter!

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.540
Teachers only think
about themselves.

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:42.342
That's why he could turn on us
like that without any guilt.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.209
You're still a child.

00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:47.745
Of course, they only
think of themselves.

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:49.816
Teachers are human, too.

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.023
When they get cornered...

00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:54.456
...of course they will
defend themselves first.

00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:56.925
What do you
expect teachers to do?

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.687
You're old enough.
You should know that.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:05.494
Even Onizuka is just
a 22-year old man. But...

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:09.697
...at least he isn't pretending.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:14.103
It's written all over his face.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:16.214
And he doesn't try to hide it.

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:21.619
He isn't a hypocrite
like the other teachers.

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:22.988
That is...

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.187
He puts on a good act.
All adults are...

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.526
...the same!

00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:29.594
I wonder if that's true.

00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:30.729
Of course it is!

00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:34.357
Urumi, I don't know
what you're up to...

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:39.432
...but if you interfere,
I won't forgive you.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:43.106
What do you mean?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.378
I'll tell the entire school
about your father.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:08.264
Miyabi, it wouldn't be
wise to make me angry.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:09.856
What do you mean?!

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.096
I said what I mean.

00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:18.035
Don't pull that crap!

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:22.306
What will happen
if I make you angry?!

00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:29.314
The friendship of Onibaku...

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:33.156
...boils down to
a single raffle ticket.

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.117
Next, please!

00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:45.566
You are a lucky guy!

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:48.168
He has won the grand prize!

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:51.933
Now we'll have the presentation
of the grand prize. Follow me!

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:53.903
Oh, no, wait a minute!

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.045
What's the grand prize?
One year's supply of cooking oil?

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.910
Excuse me, but I'm kind of busy.

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:04.617
And here's the grand prize!

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:08.956
Wow! This is...

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:11.863
Well...

00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:27.245
What's that?

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.252
Excellent! Excellent!

00:06:38.457 --> 00:06:39.515
GRAND PRIZE

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:48.523
Look!

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:50.863
What's that? A Mercedes Benz?!

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.102
Grand prize!? Raffle ticket?!

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.765
Onizuka!

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.840
He did it!

00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.908
Huh?

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.442
It's a Mercedes Benz E430.

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:00.672
Its asking price is 8.6 million yen.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:04.010
If he sells it, he'll
have enough money.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.618
Are you serious?!

00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:11.889
It's the extremely,
super-duper, incredible...

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:13.719
...miraculously lucky man...

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.186
...Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:17.521
Greetings!

00:07:20.332 --> 00:07:21.959
He did it!

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:23.934
Great job! Onizuka!

00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:26.698
Now we can really go to Okinawa!

00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:29.968
Yeah! He did it!

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:31.602
Onizuka-sensei...

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.637
Everyone! Let's go out!

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.824
Hey! Onizuka!

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.469
You came onto sacred
school grounds in a car!

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.333
- What were you thinking?!
- Shut up!

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:05.409
Does that Mercedes
really cost that much?

00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.075
Yes, it costs at least 8 million yen.

00:08:08.513 --> 00:08:10.071
What's happening?!

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:14.518
I can't believe that jerk has
a car that's more expensive...

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.985
...than my Cresta.

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:19.421
And his car will bail him out?!

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:21.125
I can't let it go!

00:08:25.898 --> 00:08:27.422
- Vice Principal!
- Calm down!

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.758
Get your hands off of me!

00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:31.461
I'll kill him, and then I'll kill myself.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.867
He's an incredibly lucky guy.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.143
Yes, but there are still
three days before the deadline.

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:43.810
I hope nothing happens
in the meantime.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.642
So this is the Mercedes Benz!

00:08:49.254 --> 00:08:53.554
See, you guys?
Now do you see how lucky I am?!

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.524
My luck is
at a supernatural level now.

00:08:56.061 --> 00:08:59.030
Whatever.
But isn't this muffler too noisy?

00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.599
Yeah, I cut a little hole in it.

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:02.756
You're selling this, aren't you?

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:06.132
Hey, Miyabi.
What are you going to do?

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.773
You're not going
to quit now, are you?

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:10.638
Don't be an idiot!

00:09:12.377 --> 00:09:15.107
I will crush him!

00:09:15.614 --> 00:09:17.411
I will absolutely crush him!

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:19.743
But do you have a plan?

00:09:19.952 --> 00:09:22.580
Yeah. We only
have three days left.

00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.312
We can't set up...

00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:25.480
...anything new.

00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:28.593
Yes, we can.

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:29.861
What?

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.062
I have a good plan.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.499
Hey, Ryuji.

00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:43.036
Man! How did you get that?

00:09:43.675 --> 00:09:46.667
Did you go crazy and rip it off?

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:50.745
Fool! Did you
forget how lucky I am?

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.679
Don't you remember
when I won the body board...

00:09:52.784 --> 00:09:54.718
...in the raffle put on by the
Tsujido Business Association?

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.486
You mean that raffle ticket?

00:09:56.822 --> 00:09:59.450
Yep! It's the grand prize!
The grand prize!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.487
Eikichi! That was the raffle ticket
I got at the supermarket!

00:10:05.831 --> 00:10:08.026
So then this is mine!

00:10:08.133 --> 00:10:10.931
Fool! I was the one
who got the ticket!

00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:13.528
Think about the New
Year's card with raffle tickets.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.873
Whoever gets the winning
card can claim the prize.

00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.601
Shut up!

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.803
Don't compare a Mercedes
with portable bicycles!

00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:25.245
Leave this car with me!

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.648
Move! We're selling this now!

00:10:28.186 --> 00:10:31.087
If you damage it and the value
goes down, I'll kill you!

00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:32.950
Then with the money you get...

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.218
...you can return
the 870,000 yen you owe me!

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:37.226
Hey, Baku...

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:41.397
...you don't want to jeopardize our
friendship over money, do you?

00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:53.567
From now on, as always...

00:10:53.812 --> 00:10:55.473
...consider me your best friend!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.611
Oh, you're home early.

00:11:01.553 --> 00:11:05.819
I guess I'm not fully recovered
from my cold so I left school early.

00:11:11.363 --> 00:11:14.730
Miyabi, are you all right?

00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:18.526
We may have some homework.

00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.132
I'm just going
to use Dad's computer...

00:11:20.338 --> 00:11:22.533
...to download some
data from my friend.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.217
HIRAMATSU METAL

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:35.620
Here it is.

00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:44.622
FUKU BIKI KEN - ACHO!
(RAFFLE TICKET - YEAH!)

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:48.824
Okay, then. I'm going to sell it.

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.335
I kind of want to keep it.

00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:53.599
Oh, well...

00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:56.173
Damn that Miyabi!

00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:59.174
What's the matter, Kanzaki?

00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:01.509
Nothing.

00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:06.485
Okinawa!

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:08.486
I have to buy a swimsuit!

00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:10.516
Are you sure you're all right?

00:12:10.723 --> 00:12:12.418
Yeah, I'm back to normal now.

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:17.053
The homework is too hard.
I'm going to do it with my friends.

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:19.061
Don't stay out too late.

00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:20.325
All right!

00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:31.165
I won't let him do
what he wants! Never!

00:12:34.847 --> 00:12:39.113
I don't want to sell the Mercedes
Benz now that I have it...

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:42.278
...but in order to make 8 million,
I don't think I have any choice.

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:45.983
I've got an idea! How about
adding an AMGbody kit...

00:12:46.092 --> 00:12:48.890
...and saying that this is an AMG?

00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:51.520
Then maybe I can
get another 2 million.

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:55.795
Then I can pocket
the extra money.

00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:57.334
And I can go to Hawaii
for two months...

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:59.527
...and spend time
with a blond girl...

00:13:18.224 --> 00:13:19.714
Hey!

00:13:24.597 --> 00:13:26.428
Hello. Miyabi?

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:29.797
He just jumped
in front of him. Yeah...

00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:32.096
He didn't run over him.

00:13:38.544 --> 00:13:41.809
He damaged the front end
when he hit an electrical pole.

00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:44.445
Does this mean
the plan didn't work?

00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:47.082
Don't worry. Just in case...

00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:50.217
...I gave several plans
to that man.

00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:52.790
Keep on watching them.
I'll be there in a minute.

00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:07.766
Miyabi is making her move.
I'm investigating the details now.

00:14:08.874 --> 00:14:11.707
Find Onizuka immediately. Urumi.

00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:13.777
Kanzaki!

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:19.406
You!

00:14:24.857 --> 00:14:28.657
Hey, you! Old man! Why did
you jump in front of me?!

00:14:29.228 --> 00:14:32.789
In order to avoid hitting you,
I smashed the Mercedes!

00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:35.591
Hey, what are you going to do?!

00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:37.766
My Mercedes!

00:14:39.438 --> 00:14:40.803
I'm so sorry!

00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:46.339
I know it's wrong, but this is...

00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:48.512
...this is the only thing I could do!

00:14:49.849 --> 00:14:50.816
To die!

00:14:51.183 --> 00:14:52.207
To die...?

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:58.748
We can't find him!

00:14:58.991 --> 00:15:00.185
We've checked everywhere...

00:15:00.392 --> 00:15:02.622
...but he didn't sell
the Mercedes anywhere.

00:15:03.062 --> 00:15:04.927
He hasn't returned
to the school yet, either.

00:15:05.164 --> 00:15:07.598
Kikuchi, what's happening?

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.295
Miyabi did it.

00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:12.828
What do you mean, Kanzaki?

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:16.834
Miyabi's father is the manager
of the finance division at a bank.

00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:19.976
From his bank's data,
she found a small business client...

00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:24.615
...who was denied
financing and desperate.

00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.381
She got him to jump
in front of Onizuka's Mercedes.

00:15:27.953 --> 00:15:29.887
That.!

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.886
Why would anyone
do something like that?!

00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:35.285
Both the Mercedes
and the man are okay...

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:38.094
...but Miyabi is thinking
about another plan.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.430
You know where it
happened, don't you?

00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:43.992
Yeah, I have an idea.

00:15:44.703 --> 00:15:47.570
My name is Hiramatsu.

00:15:47.773 --> 00:15:51.140
I own a company
called Hiramatsu Metal.

00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:55.976
It's just a small factory...

00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:58.210
...making parts for cars.

00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:00.781
There are only 20 employees.

00:16:06.992 --> 00:16:11.019
Our bank just cut off our credit.

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:15.167
It's pretty serious.

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:18.300
They know what will happen
to a factory whose credit...

00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:20.731
...is terminated
during this bad economy.

00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:26.103
I bowed many times
like the grasshopper.

00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:27.472
But it's no use.

00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:32.075
I have a promissory note for 5
million due the day after tomorrow.

00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:34.611
I don't think I can pay it.

00:16:35.688 --> 00:16:37.019
What a pity!

00:16:37.356 --> 00:16:40.655
If I could pay off the note, new
equipment could be delivered.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.085
It had all been arranged!

00:16:46.165 --> 00:16:50.261
I can't face my employees
who've worked so hard.

00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:54.300
If I knew this would happen,
I would have folded the company...

00:16:54.406 --> 00:16:56.340
...when my father died.

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:59.035
I should have continued
working as a teacher.

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.709
A teacher?

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:07.517
Yes. I was having fun at that time.

00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:11.215
To tell you the truth...

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:13.086
...one of my students asked me...

00:17:13.192 --> 00:17:15.160
...to be the cosigner
for his loan last year.

00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:17.227
He was a member
of the baseball team...

00:17:17.363 --> 00:17:19.024
...and he was quite the delinquent.

00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:23.358
But he was a good kid,
and I was willing to cosign.

00:17:24.436 --> 00:17:27.428
But he disappeared.

00:17:28.274 --> 00:17:32.574
So I had to pay off his debt.

00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:35.038
That was the beginning
of my downfall.

00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:39.012
That debt brought another debt,
and it began to snowball.

00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:44.184
No, I don't resent him.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:50.486
I believe he's working very hard
to return the money to me.

00:17:51.964 --> 00:17:54.455
I got a call from him the other day.

00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:57.235
He said he could return
the money within three days.

00:17:58.871 --> 00:18:04.002
But three days later, for some
reason, he didn't show up.

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:08.870
Well, I think he can
return it in a few days.

00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:14.914
Unfortunately, our factory
can't stay in business that long.

00:18:15.788 --> 00:18:18.222
I feel bad for him...

00:18:18.324 --> 00:18:20.485
...when he's trying
to pay me back.

00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:24.067
Hiramatsu-sensei...

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.224
Your student will
come through. Definitely.

00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:31.302
It's a good story.

00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:33.938
Here.

00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:38.704
It's the key to the Mercedes.

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:41.337
You need to pay off
the notes, don't you?

00:18:41.814 --> 00:18:43.543
It's a little damaged.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.013
But if you sell it,
you can get 8 million yen.

00:18:47.986 --> 00:18:48.953
But...

00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:53.490
That's all right. I still have
three days before I need money.

00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:55.655
If you can return
the money by then...

00:18:56.862 --> 00:19:01.094
I want to believe in him, too.

00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:05.059
As a matter of fact, I'm a teacher,
although I may not look like one.

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:15.874
If a teacher can't trust others,
what's the point of it all?

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.448
He's so stupid!
He took it so seriously.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.852
This is the end of Onizuka.

00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:32.254
I'm worried a little bit, though.

00:19:32.664 --> 00:19:35.633
I told you I have several plans.

00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:37.163
Great, Miyabi!

00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:40.833
So was the man lying
about being a teacher?

00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:45.733
Of course! I told the man
Onizuka was a teacher.

00:19:46.612 --> 00:19:49.206
In order to gain his sympathy,
he must have made up the story.

00:19:49.848 --> 00:19:53.284
Let's go to Karaoke to celebrate
the defeat of Onizuka!

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:57.219
- I'm in!
- I'll sing all of the songs!

00:19:57.923 --> 00:19:59.322
You loaned it?!

00:20:01.193 --> 00:20:05.254
Are you stupid?
It's all a trap set by Miyabi!

00:20:05.364 --> 00:20:09.698
But if I didn't give him my
Mercedes, he might be dead!

00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:14.496
And he promised that he'll
return the money in three days.

00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:18.140
How can he guarantee that?!

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.277
We have to see him right away
and get the Mercedes back!

00:20:21.814 --> 00:20:24.442
No matter how you look at it,
Miyabi went too far!

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.040
Why don't you get angry?!

00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:29.382
Because she's also my student.

00:20:30.389 --> 00:20:34.450
She's very energetic,
but she's using it in the wrong way.

00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:35.693
Listen!

00:20:36.595 --> 00:20:40.895
Don't worry.
I've decided to trust him.

00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:43.228
All right, then...

00:20:43.335 --> 00:20:45.496
Where are you going
at a time like this?

00:20:45.671 --> 00:20:47.502
My part-time job! My part-time job!

00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:50.170
I'm scheduled to work
up to the last day...

00:20:50.342 --> 00:20:51.309
...so I'm going.

00:20:52.144 --> 00:20:53.338
What a clown!

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:56.409
The Mercedes won't
come back, will it?

00:20:56.682 --> 00:21:00.641
Of course not! There are
no happy endings like that!

00:21:01.186 --> 00:21:04.383
Then...he'll get fired anyway.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.618
I won't let it happen.

00:21:08.093 --> 00:21:11.119
We still have three days.
We haven't been beaten yet.

00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:15.262
I told Miyabi...

00:21:18.103 --> 00:21:19.229
...she'd better not...

00:21:19.438 --> 00:21:22.407
...get on my bad side.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:27.435
I guess they need a harsh lesson.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:49.839
You can't love everyone

00:21:50.045 --> 00:21:53.105
It's only for the one you love

00:21:53.348 --> 00:21:57.250
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:21:57.419 --> 00:22:02.652
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:07.220
Just stay innocent

00:22:07.496 --> 00:22:11.432
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:19.573
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:24.369
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:26.114 --> 00:22:29.641
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:29.885 --> 00:22:33.878
What is there for me to do?

00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:37.922
It may be small now

00:22:38.126 --> 00:22:42.085
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.925
A tear is about to drop

00:22:46.268 --> 00:22:50.204
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:54.067
Live strong every moment

00:22:54.276 --> 00:23:00.215
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:14.795
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:17.296
20 million yen from each of you,
which comes to 60 million.

00:23:18.233 --> 00:23:21.498
Out of that, we'll take 8 million...

00:23:21.603 --> 00:23:23.628
...to cover Onizuka's debt.

00:23:24.472 --> 00:23:26.463
Do you know
what you're talking about?!

00:23:26.575 --> 00:23:27.735
I'm going to call the police!

00:23:39.621 --> 00:23:40.883
What are you talking about?

00:23:42.257 --> 00:23:43.622
Are you stupid?

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:51.263
SEE YA NEXT TIME
