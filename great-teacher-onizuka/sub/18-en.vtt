Hmm... Hmm... La la la...
Pearly white... My car...

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.469
Cresta...La la la...

00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:55.504
Finally...
she came back to me.

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.775
My Cresta 2500.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.874
With pre-installed multi-AV station
and GPS voice navigation.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.881
Behold! The swift handling!

00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:08.681
The secure feel of grounding
with 4-wheel double wishbone!

00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:12.245
Power steering with speed sensor
for optimum weight!

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:14.450
Each feature is the ultimate!

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.256
Hurray!
To commute by personal vehicle.

00:02:17.696 --> 00:02:22.190
But... I need to be cautious,
because there is THAT guy at school.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.598
THAT devil who destroyed this car
many times! THAT Onizuka germ!

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.737
1st CRESTA

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.033
2nd CRESTA

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.674
3rd CRESTA

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.707
I'll never let him destroy my car.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:42.114
That's why I made sure
I got here while he was still asleep.

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:45.585
I'll cover it with a tarp
as soon as I get to the parking lot.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.030
Whoa!

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.306
Oooo... Ni...Zu...Ka.!

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:08.571
Good morning, Vice Principal.

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:10.882
Why is someone like you...

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.350
...sweeping the school grounds
so early in the morning?

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.678
Were you waiting for me?

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:21.283
Don't tell me
you were going to target my Cresta..!

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:24.251
That must be it! Even if you try,
you can't deceive my eyes.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.787
Crap! Why do I need to do this
so early in the morning?

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:32.303
I'm not an Ojisan (Old Man).
That bitch, Kanzaki!

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:35.571
Hey, say something! You are
so envious of my Cresta. That's why...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.732
Don't come near me!
Don't come! Don't come!

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:38.173
Don't come!

00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:39.505
Don't come!

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:46.940
Whoa!

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:58.561
Hey, the vice principal's car
is wrecked again!

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.825
Never mind. Never mind.
Come this way.

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:04.561
Good morning! Genie!

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.834
Whoa! It's true.

00:04:07.906 --> 00:04:10.067
Onizuka is really sweeping!

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.768
We get to see something
extremely rare...

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:14.377
It was worth getting up early!

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:16.539
See? I told you so.

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:22.518
Teacher became a genie
who makes whatever I wish come true!

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.279
What the hell is that?

00:04:24.356 --> 00:04:25.755
He really makes any wishes
come true for me.

00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:28.322
That brat, Kanzaki!
She's getting carried away.

00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:29.925
Someday I'm gonna kill her.
Then next time...

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:32.486
... I will be sure to take her
to the forest at the base of Mt. Fuji.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.397
He says, "Pah-pa-ra-pah!" and...
Isn't it right, Mr. Onizuka?

00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:41.499
Imprisonment.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.101
Teacher! Isn't it right?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.732
Um...sort of.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.002
Smile.

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.639
Aye-aye, Master!

00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:53.850
Then, next, shall I ask you
to clean toilets?

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.384
What?

00:04:55.787 --> 00:04:56.811
Your response?

00:04:57.488 --> 00:04:59.786
Aye-aye, Master!

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:02.652
Awesome! She's Kanzaki, after all.

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:05.924
To enforce absolute
obedience on Onizuka!

00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:07.497
He's practically a slave.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.735
Onizuka let such a tricky person
get ahold of his weaknesses...

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.404
Ah, by the way...

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:18.635
I think my genie is going to fulfill
my wish to play hooky...

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.740
...during social studies
and go eat sushi.

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:23.644
Do you guys want to come with me?

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:29.680
Not only that, but he will treat us
to plenty of fatty tuna, full of DHA.

00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.288
Did you say sushi?

00:05:31.422 --> 00:05:33.617
- Hmm...sushi sounds good.
- Ah...how many years has it been?

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:37.124
Hey...you guys have school lunch...
school lunch!

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.490
But it doesn't taste good.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.732
Whether it's horrible or smelly...

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.030
...you students just need to eat
without complaining.

00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:49.303
I see...then you like prison food.

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:52.741
Would you like to eat prison food?

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.406
Genie, come out!

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.477
Pah-pa-ra-pah!

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:02.145
Whoa!

00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:06.756
Genie, I want to eat plenty of Toro!

00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:10.618
Aye-aye, Master!

00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:13.061
STUDY HOUR!
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
BYE. ONIZUKA

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:15.165
Have you heard, Principal?

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:18.259
Kanzaki-san has been coming
to school every day now.

00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:21.668
Yes. I should have known that
Mr. Onizuka would make it possible.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:26.875
I got depressed just by not being able
to answer some questions.

00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:28.606
I need to learn from Mr. Onizuka.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.207
I wonder how he got her to like school.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.652
I'm sure it's the power of love!

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:37.081
Mr. Onizuka has a lot of that...

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.951
I'm gonna kill her!

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.548
I'm gonna kill her!
That wench, Kanzaki...

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:42.957
I will definitely kill her some day!

00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:45.793
Does he have love?

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:46.852
Maybe not...

00:06:50.635 --> 00:06:53.035
Whoa! Awesome!

00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:56.005
The finest sushi
from Kishijoji Sushi Restaurant.

00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:57.540
Awesome! It looks great...seriously!

00:06:57.608 --> 00:06:59.371
Here is some Oh-toro. Oh-toro!

00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:02.504
Are you happy now?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.572
I paid 9,800 yen for 5 servings.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.141
Even I've never eaten sushi like this.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.818
Itadakimasu.
(Thank you for the food)

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.920
Hmmm. Tasty...
Hmm, whoa...good...

00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:14.616
This is not...right.

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:17.525
It doesn't have enough fat
and the color is kind of dark blackish.

00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:19.495
It looks like it belongs
to the tuna family...

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.259
...but it's an imported, frozen,
yellow skin tuna.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:23.966
You dummy!

00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:25.525
It's Toro, Oh-toro (Fatty Tuna).

00:07:25.603 --> 00:07:27.798
Look at the order sheet. Here...

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:31.170
Real Oh-toro comes from blue-fin tuna.
So this is not real Oh-toro!

00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:32.638
What!?

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:38.205
I said I wanted to eat Oh-toro.
Real Oh-toro.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:39.916
All right, genie?

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:43.884
SUSHI: KANAHAMA

00:07:44.022 --> 00:07:45.148
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:49.724
Whoaaa!
What is this?

00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:52.126
This is...real Oh-toro.

00:07:52.964 --> 00:07:55.194
Awesome!
They look like Kobe Beef!

00:07:55.733 --> 00:07:58.668
Thank you for the food!

00:07:58.736 --> 00:07:59.896
Whoa!

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:06.237
So, this is real Oh-toro.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.642
- Delicious! Delicious!
- Ahhh...it melts in your mouth!

00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:11.373
Yeah. I approve of this!

00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:14.313
This is ultimate Oh-toro!

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.910
Speaking of "toro,"
what happened to Toroko?

00:08:17.989 --> 00:08:19.854
I haven't seen her at school.

00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:21.389
Ah, Toroko is...

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.359
There! That's her.
She's coming on TV.

00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:24.292
What?

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:28.223
Romeo. Oh, Romeo!
Where are you?

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.400
She was awarded
the judges' Special Prize...

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.869
...at the Inogashira Park
Image Girl contest.

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:35.801
Now she's in a commercial.

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:36.862
INTRODUCING
THE LATEST MODELS

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:38.736
- She's not that popular yet...
- Oh, Romeo, where are you?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.209
... but she did debut
in the entertainment industry.

00:08:40.878 --> 00:08:43.142
Hmmm....That Toroko...

00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:45.079
Ah, it's gone already!

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.507
Let's order some more.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:48.877
FATTY TUNA (OH-TORO)
MARKET PRICE

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.044
Waiter, second serving!

00:08:51.122 --> 00:08:52.487
Here they are!

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.548
Delicious! The best!

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:55.826
Toro...toro...

00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:57.722
Teacher, aren't you gonna eat?

00:08:57.795 --> 00:08:58.921
It'll be gone soon!

00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:01.895
Hmm.... Delicious!

00:09:04.869 --> 00:09:06.029
Teacher...

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:11.504
Oh-toro, add five more servings!

00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:12.700
All right!

00:09:19.584 --> 00:09:22.576
Whoa! Hmmm...delicious!

00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:24.780
Hey, chef, give me fresh green tea.

00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:27.150
- Hey...hey...
- Delicious...Ah...delicious!

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:29.255
Is he gonna be O.K.?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.658
I'm sure it's already over 100,000 yen.

00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:36.796
Abalone and sea urchin,
five more servings.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.496
Then bring a sashimi platter.

00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.908
Hmm...Delicious!

00:09:45.143 --> 00:09:47.771
Add salmon roe and ark shell
and sweet shrimp, 10 more servings.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:48.937
Hey...hey...

00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:53.016
Delicious...

00:09:53.084 --> 00:09:54.278
Teacher...

00:09:54.352 --> 00:09:56.286
Well, when you eat sushi
you need to go all the way...

00:09:57.655 --> 00:09:58.747
Whoa!

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:01.624
Wait!

00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:04.619
Eat and run!

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:06.621
Wait!

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.199
Eat and run!

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:11.458
I just need to go get money!

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:13.936
You guys can wait for me here!

00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:15.199
I can't trust you.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.872
Then why are you
holding such a thing?

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:19.541
As a token!

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.372
I can't believe it!
Why did it turn out to be this way?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.504
If you think about it...

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.073
How can he have enough money
to go to such an expensive restaurant?

00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:29.346
You should have thought
about it beforehand!

00:10:29.487 --> 00:10:32.513
The only thing we can do now
is to shake him off!

00:10:32.623 --> 00:10:34.750
That was your idea
from the very beginning, wasn't it?

00:10:35.393 --> 00:10:36.724
Whoaaaa!

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:43.163
Teacher!

00:10:43.568 --> 00:10:46.469
Teacher! Are you all right?
Hang in there!

00:10:47.738 --> 00:10:49.467
It's not my fault.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.909
He sprang out from nowhere.
I'm not at fault!

00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:55.036
What?

00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:00.781
Aren't you supposed
to call for an ambulance?

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:05.512
Is that what you say
when you hit someone?

00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:07.920
Don't you have any feelings?

00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:10.060
I'm so sorry!

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.190
I demand compensation!

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:15.164
Hospitalization fee,
consolation fee, worker's comp...

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:18.259
...compensation for emotional stress
and treatment for a total of 5 million yen!

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:20.770
And you pay the bill at the restaurant!

00:11:20.838 --> 00:11:23.238
Get the money right now!
Do you understand?

00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:26.572
Hey, you! Hold on.
I'm getting your bill paid.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.111
That's...outrageous...

00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:31.509
What's wrong, Mr. Manager?

00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:33.072
Don't come out, Tomo-chan.

00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:34.648
Piko-rin.

00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:36.150
Piko-rin?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.222
Ah...Mr. Onizuka is just faking it
for the insurance money.

00:11:40.424 --> 00:11:44.087
Would I be bleeding this much
if I were faking?

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:45.989
Yoo-hoo!

00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:47.956
Toroko!

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:50.759
Everyone...at such a place...

00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:57.535
Uru...Uru...Urumi!

00:11:57.775 --> 00:11:59.140
It's been a long time...

00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:02.712
I've wanted to see you!

00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:05.244
Oh, good girl, good girl...

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:07.440
- Have you been well, Toro-chan?
- Yes.

00:12:13.642 --> 00:12:17.466
- Yay...Yay!
- Is that so?
- It's Urumi-chan! Urumi-chan!

00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:20.858
So, they've been in the same class
since elementary school.

00:12:20.858 --> 00:12:23.224
No wonder they are good buddies.

00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:24.851
Instead of calling them buddies...

00:12:25.593 --> 00:12:27.151
Sit!

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:31.756
Shake! Good...
you are so cute, as usual, Toroko.

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:35.930
Yay, yay... I was praised by Urumi!

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.370
It's more like a pet and its owner.

00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:39.463
I see.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.202
But it's unusual that she'd be
so attached to someone like Kanzaki.

00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:47.008
Maybe it's because she is so innocent.

00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:50.607
Ah, add more Toro.
Three more servings.

00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:52.778
Then salmon roe and abalone...

00:12:52.853 --> 00:12:54.377
Are you still eating?

00:12:57.591 --> 00:12:59.058
Well...after I got hit by the car...

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:02.095
...and started bleeding,
I felt hungry all of a sudden.

00:13:02.563 --> 00:13:04.224
Um...excuse me...

00:13:04.298 --> 00:13:07.267
...but the bill is
over 200,000 yen already.

00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:09.325
How are you going to pay...?

00:13:09.403 --> 00:13:10.893
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:13.303
This guy will pay for all of it.

00:13:13.374 --> 00:13:14.864
What? Me?

00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:16.673
It's impossible!

00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:18.974
I can't expense a receipt
with such high figures!

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.414
Ugh! All of a sudden I have
a pounding headache!

00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:26.180
Whoa! My knee started to buckle...

00:13:26.454 --> 00:13:28.285
All right! I'll pay!

00:13:28.422 --> 00:13:30.356
You'll be happy if I pay, right?

00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:35.428
This is why Onizuka
hasn't wiped the blood off.

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:38.526
- Then can I use a card?
- Yes.

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:41.526
What is it? Is it over already?

00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:43.301
We have more work!

00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:45.537
Tomo-chan has a magazine interview
to go to.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.004
Let's go, Tomo-chan.

00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:49.042
Yes.

00:13:49.577 --> 00:13:52.808
Huh? You're already being
interviewed by magazines?

00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:55.808
It's a magazine which features
photos and articles.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.383
There's a section...

00:13:57.485 --> 00:13:59.715
...called "Together With My Teacher"
which introduces new talent.

00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:02.051
She meets with her teacher
at a memorable place...

00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:04.057
...and talks about
their memories together.

00:14:04.225 --> 00:14:06.716
Teacher? Wait!

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:09.385
I'm Tomoko's teacher.

00:14:09.563 --> 00:14:11.497
I haven't heard about it yet!

00:14:11.932 --> 00:14:16.631
A female idol's teacher
is supposed to be female!

00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.898
Who decided that? Who?

00:14:18.973 --> 00:14:20.065
I don't know.

00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:22.700
A female teacher?

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.136
Yes! So, I asked Fujimori-sensei.

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:29.205
Remember? Our homeroom
teacher in 5th grade.

00:14:29.784 --> 00:14:32.719
Huh... Fujimori-sensei...

00:14:33.454 --> 00:14:36.014
This...this teacher...

00:14:36.157 --> 00:14:37.886
...is she married?

00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.391
I heard she's not.

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:41.117
How old is she?

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:42.262
Let's see...

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:46.322
She said she became our
homeroom teacher right out of college.

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:48.627
Then...

00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:50.628
She would be 26 or 27.

00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:52.801
Good! Within my range!

00:14:52.973 --> 00:14:55.635
Hey, can I come with you?

00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:57.677
I know that teacher, too.

00:14:57.845 --> 00:14:58.903
What?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.173
Then I'll come along, too.

00:15:01.515 --> 00:15:04.746
As her current homeroom teacher,
I would like to meet her...

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:06.075
What?

00:15:09.757 --> 00:15:13.124
Um...
These clothes have blood stains.

00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:16.953
Those stains are there
because you hit me with your car!

00:15:17.064 --> 00:15:19.726
I can't meet with a beautiful teacher
in these clothes!

00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:25.130
How can he be so energetic
after being hit by a car?

00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:27.900
Falling from a roof didn't faze him!

00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:31.369
He's got such a strong body!
Unbelievable...

00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:44.348
Fujimori-sensei! Teacher!

00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:46.326
Nomura-san?

00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:48.428
Tomoko Nomura-san?

00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:49.929
Yes. It's Toroko!

00:15:50.464 --> 00:15:52.989
It's been a long time!
Have you been well?

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:54.295
Yes. I've been great!

00:15:54.835 --> 00:15:57.599
I'm with the monthly magazine
Shashin Toko.

00:15:58.339 --> 00:15:59.931
How do you do?

00:16:00.007 --> 00:16:02.407
I'm Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old
and a bachelor.

00:16:02.476 --> 00:16:07.504
I'm the homeroom teacher of Toro...
uh, no. Nomura-kun at Seirin School.

00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:09.846
Please remember me...

00:16:10.384 --> 00:16:11.749
Uh...huh...

00:16:12.052 --> 00:16:14.543
He is a very fun teacher!

00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:17.020
I'm so touched to be able to meet...

00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:21.027
...Nomura-kun's homeroom
teacher from elementary school.

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:25.693
How about exchanging
numbers after this?

00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:29.393
Exchange numbers?

00:16:30.104 --> 00:16:35.064
In addition!
We have another special guest today.

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:36.904
Urumi-chan!

00:16:37.278 --> 00:16:39.803
What? Urumi?
Could it be...?

00:16:45.352 --> 00:16:47.820
Ka... Ka... Kanzaki-san.

00:16:48.122 --> 00:16:51.353
It's been a long time, Fujimori-sensei.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:53.783
Have you been well?

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:56.753
You...you look well, too.

00:16:57.398 --> 00:16:59.229
Are you still a teacher?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.324
Uh...yes.

00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:03.200
You're still a teacher...

00:17:03.437 --> 00:17:07.237
Umm... Kanzaki-san, I...

00:17:07.841 --> 00:17:10.332
I have wanted to apologize
to you for a long time...

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:18.910
French?

00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:31.795
Shit! Throw it away!
It contains gas!

00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:40.536
Water! Get some water! Hurry!

00:17:42.443 --> 00:17:43.501
Teacher!

00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:44.937
Oh!

00:17:48.449 --> 00:17:51.509
Teacher! Fujimori-sensei!

00:17:51.952 --> 00:17:54.147
Kanzaki!
What were you thinking?

00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:56.052
Look at what you did
to your school teacher!

00:17:56.624 --> 00:17:58.319
A school teacher?

00:17:58.659 --> 00:18:02.151
It's the most despicable career!

00:18:03.297 --> 00:18:06.061
What? What do you mean?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.836
Why don't you ask her?

00:18:10.337 --> 00:18:12.498
Only if she talks, though.

00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:14.431
What about you?
Are you gonna talk?

00:18:14.508 --> 00:18:15.702
Like that time?

00:18:17.244 --> 00:18:18.233
Teacher!

00:18:18.379 --> 00:18:22.440
Mr. Onizuka.
She is your type, isn't she?

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.674
What?

00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:25.952
You can do whatever you want.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.845
Don't worry. She won't resist.

00:18:29.223 --> 00:18:31.555
Right? Fujimori-sensei?

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:38.054
Now do it! Genie!

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:41.627
Don't be ridiculous!

00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:44.028
That's enough.

00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:46.099
Is that so?

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.771
Then playing a genie
is over, too, isn't it?

00:18:50.878 --> 00:18:52.743
Hey! Wait, Kanzaki!

00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:54.478
Apologize to the teacher!

00:18:54.548 --> 00:18:55.981
It's...all right.

00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:01.047
I was at fault. I was...

00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:05.054
But what she did is
far more than a bad joke!

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:09.926
I need to reprimand her severely!
As a teacher!

00:19:10.564 --> 00:19:12.657
It's O.K. Really...

00:19:12.733 --> 00:19:15.759
I was at fault...that's why she...

00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:19.264
What happened four years ago?

00:19:20.741 --> 00:19:21.799
No... Nothing.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.610
Teacher...

00:19:24.978 --> 00:19:30.280
I did something unforgivable,
as a teacher...

00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:33.181
...and as a human being.

00:19:35.089 --> 00:19:36.147
Urumi...

00:19:37.991 --> 00:19:42.018
Urumi...
had the same look as that time...

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:43.859
What do you mean by "that time"?

00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.099
Our school went...

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.155
Boom!

00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:02.378
Is that brat gonna terrorize
the class again?

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.012
That's for sure.

00:20:04.418 --> 00:20:09.981
It could be much bigger in scale
than the previous acts.

00:20:10.357 --> 00:20:13.520
It's my fault...

00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:15.186
Crap!

00:20:15.262 --> 00:20:16.229
Teacher!

00:20:16.296 --> 00:20:18.526
We're gonna catch her!

00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:20.629
Yes...sir!

00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:26.600
Kanzaki!

00:20:36.383 --> 00:20:39.477
Ah, what's wrong, Kanzaki-san?
Are you feeling sick or something?

00:20:39.787 --> 00:20:41.584
Seventy-seven, seventy-six...

00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:44.116
...seventy-five...seventy-four...

00:20:44.224 --> 00:20:45.350
...seventy-three...

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.028
Twenty-nine, twenty-eight,
twenty-seven...

00:20:52.266 --> 00:20:55.064
Four...three...two...

00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:56.224
...one...

00:20:56.303 --> 00:20:57.463
...zero!

00:21:02.776 --> 00:21:04.209
This is.!

00:21:12.653 --> 00:21:14.484
We were one second too late!

00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:17.954
Could this be Kanzaki's doing?

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:21.253
There is no other person
who could do a thing like this!

00:21:21.628 --> 00:21:23.596
I can't believe she went this far...

00:21:24.531 --> 00:21:25.998
Kanzaki!

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:28.763
As your teacher,
I'm gonna beat the crap out of you...

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:31.930
...to straighten out your
utterly corrupt behavior!

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:52.608
Subete no hito wo aiseru wake ja
