WEBVTT

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:11.545
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:16.828
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:23.756
This street makes me love

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:27.537
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:32.677
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:38.015
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:43.326
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.894
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:54.536
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.374 --> 00:01:00.744
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.110
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:11.278
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.158
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:22.731
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:26.532
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:41.502
You lost it?

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:44.523
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:45.922
I'll look for it harder.

00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:49.164
Please wait for a week.
It must be somewhere.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.936
I beg of you! Please!

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.013
You didn't steal it, did you?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.000
What are you saying?!
Of course not!

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.146
Do you know he's from a family
with five children?

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.349
Five?!

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:09.177
You said you couldn't buy
what you wanted.

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:12.314
He borrowed my lead
for a mechanical pencil...

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:13.545
... but he never returned it.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:14.779
That's right. Me, too.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.652
Is his family an example of religious
families having many kids...

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:22.952
His parents tried too hard.
Then their son becomes a criminal...

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:26.897
What are you doing?!

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.730
- Stop, Fujiyoshi!
- Shit, shit!

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.997
I have a headache
from my hangover.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.908
Take roll.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.705
Can you see this scene,
Stupid Onizuka?!

00:02:38.613 --> 00:02:40.103
Why are you making a fuss?

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:41.408
What's up?

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.649
Fujiyoshi lost the money
for our school trip.

00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:49.716
All right.
How much did he lose?

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:51.121
1, 120,000 yen...

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:57.291
Sorry, I misheard you.
How much did you say?

00:02:57.932 --> 00:02:59.229
1,120,000 yen!

00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:01.902
1,120,000 yen...?

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.733
What's this 1,120,000 yen?!

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:08.331
No, it's just in my jacket...

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:09.933
Wow, you're rich!

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.179
I just picked it up.
Let's use it all!

00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.816
1,120,000...
That's right!

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.581
I didn't know why there was
money in my jacket yesterday.

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:22.883
But the amount was
exactly 1,120,000...

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:26.820
Without realizing it,
I was taken to the girls bar...

00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:30.862
I drank a lot, got excited...
Underwear and bras...

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.694
Onizuka! Hey, Onizuka!

00:03:33.134 --> 00:03:34.431
What are you doing?!

00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:38.704
Suddenly I have a stomachache.
This is serious.

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:40.467
I have to hurry,
otherwise I may die...

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:41.974
So study by yourselves!

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:43.236
Hey, wait!
Hey, Onizuka!

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:46.513
Oh, shit!
This isn't a joke!

00:03:46.614 --> 00:03:47.911
Fujiyoshi lost some money.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:49.881
The exact same amount
of money was in my pocket.

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:52.248
And I used it all in one day?!

00:03:52.353 --> 00:03:54.913
What's going on?!

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.856
I don't understand
what happened yesterday, either!

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.018
Did it really happen?!

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.497
Yes, you were
terribly out of control yesterday.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.634
Are you serious?

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.663
You were giving away money.
You did as you liked...

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.034
...and you were a grandstander!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.107
Money?

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:14.606
You held the gal's breast
with your hands...

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.233
...and called it a human bra!

00:04:16.477 --> 00:04:17.637
Bra?!

00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.677
You got naked and said,
"Here is an elephant, paoon!"

00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.544
Elephant?!

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.085
Then you said, "I'll give you
100,000 to bathe my elephant!"

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:27.313
Bathe...?! Paoon?!

00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.813
I heard
when you came back to school...

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.324
...you were wearing
only your underwear.

00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.622
I wonder what kind of things...

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.699
...you were doing with the gals
after I left...

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:40.792
Oh, Onizuka-sensei...

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:44.269
Don't you have a class now?

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.442
Fuyutsuki-chan! Please stop!
Don't look at me like that!

00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:54.272
Something happened?

00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:57.051
As a matter of fact...

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:59.680
For you, Fuyutsuki...

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:02.152
...this may be too shocking...

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.583
Shit! Did I really do
those things to those girls?

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:09.786
Why don't I remember it?
What a waste!

00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:11.228
No! That isn't the point!

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.458
It's the money!
Did I really use it all?

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:15.502
What are you going to do, Onizuka?!
Think! Onizuka!

00:05:15.603 --> 00:05:16.592
That's right!

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:18.494
School uniform!

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:20.540
They said they're
current high school students!

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:22.233
If I can find out their school
from their school uniforms...

00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:24.004
... I can explain my situation to them
and ask them to return...

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:25.340
...some money,
I gave too much...

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:27.447
Found it! Green collar
and one straight line...

00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:29.140
Scarf was pastel cream...

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.581
Six pleated skirts...

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:33.347
No doubt! This is it!

00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:35.479
This school uniform is...

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:38.223
...the costume for special effects!

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:42.596
Teacher...

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:45.558
You surprised me!

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.190
Oh, Fujiyoshi.

00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:49.633
I'm not doing anything...

00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:50.704
Teacher...

00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:51.772
Teacher!

00:05:52.573 --> 00:05:54.507
What should I do?!

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.711
Teacher,
everyone is calling me a thief...

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:01.278
I didn't steal it! I didn't do it!

00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:03.316
I want to die.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.146
Teacher... Teacher...

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:12.190
Fujiyoshi...
Don't cry, Fujiyoshi.

00:06:12.793 --> 00:06:16.752
Don't worry.
I'll take care of the money.

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:20.728
The homeroom teacher for 3-4,
Eikichi Onizuka, will take care of it.

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.200
Teacher!

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:31.707
Excuse me...
I asked for 1,200,000 yen...

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:34.979
We can't do it
with your credit history.

00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:36.242
Credit history? Why?!

00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.346
You went shopping
with your credit card...

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:40.352
...didn't pay the bills.
It happened twice.

00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:42.284
We got the report.

00:06:42.723 --> 00:06:45.521
The only thing I bought
was underwear on sale!

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:47.116
You didn't pay.
That's the point.

00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:50.163
Please, Madam...
No, beautiful Miss.

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.754
I really need money.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.029
Please consider helping a person
in trouble. Please. I beg of you!

00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:56.626
Well, then...

00:06:57.238 --> 00:07:00.332
If you have collateral,
we may be able to give more...

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:01.408
Collateral?

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.204
Condo, land, cars...

00:07:03.377 --> 00:07:05.470
You accept cars?
Yes, I do have one!

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.945
Here it is! It's a Kawasaki Z750RSZ II.
How about that?!

00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:14.351
Isn't it cool? It's the best
of the best of Kawasaki.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.917
In Shonan, this is a legend.
It can run really fast.

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:21.718
I made a lot of improvements.
I bet I spent over 3 million yen...

00:07:22.163 --> 00:07:23.323
Then another 1,000 yen.

00:07:23.497 --> 00:07:24.964
Thousand...?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.367
LOANS YOSHIDA

00:07:27.468 --> 00:07:29.299
One thousand yen? You!
Old woman! Are you saying...

00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:31.268
-...my precious Z II is worth 2,000?!
- Calm down!

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:32.839
- What are you doing?! Police!
- All right!

00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:36.671
- Call the police! He'll attack me!
- Who will?! Don't mess with me!

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.979
I'm in trouble...

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.580
All right.
Let's think about an alternative.

00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:45.811
That's all right, teacher.

00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:47.887
What are you talking about?
It isn't all right yet.

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:48.956
Don't worry about it anymore!

00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:55.723
I can't trouble you anymore.

00:07:56.297 --> 00:07:57.457
Hey. Wait!

00:07:58.099 --> 00:07:59.066
Hey!

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.067
Fujiyoshi! It isn't any trouble!

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.237
Hey!

00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:04.638
Fuji...!

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:32.428
Fujiyoshi!

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:35.963
Aizawa! What's up?

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:41.436
Do you have a minute?

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:49.715
Onizuka!
Are you there, Onizuka?!

00:08:49.817 --> 00:08:50.784
Get up!

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:52.710
Oh, shut up. I'm busy now...

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.787
Fujiyoshi is...!

00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:56.188
Fujiyoshi is missing!

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.315
When I came to school,
I found a suicide note...

00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:00.623
He'll take full responsibility
with his death...

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:16.668
Onizuka-sensei!

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.746
Wow! He's really
like a professional cyclist.

00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:22.909
He looks very serious.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.620
Of course! Because it's his fault
Fujiyoshi is going to kill himself...

00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:30.680
That may happen!

00:09:34.295 --> 00:09:36.126
What are you talking about, Miyabi?

00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.791
Did you guys plot this?

00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:42.235
Of course.

00:09:43.137 --> 00:09:46.231
We stole the money from Fujiyoshi,
and we made Onizuka spend it all.

00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:48.604
How about that?
Isn't it great?

00:09:49.643 --> 00:09:51.702
Just wait a little bit longer, Anko.

00:09:52.313 --> 00:09:54.577
This time we'll get him kicked out.

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:59.880
Instead of cowardly Kikuchi
and others, we are going to do it.

00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:02.912
Hey, Miyabi.
Should we do the next thing now?

00:10:03.023 --> 00:10:04.650
Yeah... Is everything ready?

00:10:08.118 --> 00:10:10.403
NINGEN BURAJAA
(HUMAN BRASSIERE)

00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:13.180
Everyone,
I'm sorry that I troubled you.

00:10:13.718 --> 00:10:15.345
I have no chance
of returning the money.

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:16.886
I'm too ashamed
of myself to face you.

00:10:17.254 --> 00:10:18.881
I'm going to take
full responsibility with my death.

00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:23.693
Teacher, Murai, Kusano,
Kikuchi, Yoshikawa and everyone.

00:10:23.794 --> 00:10:25.989
Thank you very much
for everything. Good-bye.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.254
Koji Fujiyoshi.

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:29.064
Don't mess with me!

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:31.801
Where are you?!
Fujiyoshi! Where are you?!

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:33.469
Why are we...?

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:35.004
But we're so conspicuous that...

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:38.933
What's up, Onizuka? Found him?

00:10:41.512 --> 00:10:44.379
- Does anyone know Fujiyoshi?!
- Idiot! I can't see the front!

00:10:44.482 --> 00:10:45.449
AROUND HERE

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:47.176
- Answer me!
- Teacher!

00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:49.309
- Fujiyoshi!
- Police, police!

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.082
- Move! Or help us find him!
- You idiot!

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:56.924
Yeah, that's right...

00:10:57.194 --> 00:11:01.893
Okay. Yes. Let's talk
after I get there. Thanks. Bye.

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.665
Who did you call?

00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:08.437
Police. I have a friend there.

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:12.770
Hey, don't you know
any other places he might go?

00:11:12.877 --> 00:11:13.935
Not anymore.

00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:16.506
Oh, shit. What should I do?

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:17.638
It's all my fault.

00:11:18.249 --> 00:11:19.614
What do you mean?

00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:21.051
It's your fault?

00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:24.688
As a matter of fact...

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:25.756
As a matter of fact...

00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:27.153
- As a matter of fact...
- As a matter of fact...

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:28.986
- As a matter of fact...
- As a matter of fact...

00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:34.660
It seems I was the one...

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.359
...who used the money
for the school trip...

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:40.228
What do you mean?
Did you steal the money...

00:11:40.337 --> 00:11:41.634
...and blame Fujiyoshi for it...?!

00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:44.708
No, no!
I didn't steal it! Really!

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:47.902
I found many bills in my jacket,
but I decided not to worry.

00:11:48.012 --> 00:11:50.276
Sakurada-sensei and I went
to the secret gals' bar.

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:51.939
Then I drank so much
that I couldn't remember anything.

00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:53.482
I woke up in a garbage can...

00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:54.812
...and my clothes
and money were gone.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:57.353
That's the truth! Believe me!
I really didn't know!

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.325
I wanted to tell Fujiyoshi, too.

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:04.653
But I couldn't.

00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:06.957
And he's going to do
such a stupid thing...

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:10.724
So it's all my fault.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.132
That's why I...

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:17.396
...I have to find him
no matter what....

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:21.302
Teacher...

00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:29.482
Vice Principal! There it is!

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.218
Hey, you guys! Go away!

00:12:33.758 --> 00:12:34.747
THE CROOKED TEACHER
ONIZUKA'S TRUE FACE!!

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:35.826
ONIZUKA PUT
THE BLAME ON FUJIYOSHI!!

00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:36.984
He embezzled...

00:12:37.094 --> 00:12:38.254
Fujiyoshi didn't come in today...

00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:39.920
- Onizuka, either.
- This is the reason.

00:12:40.598 --> 00:12:41.826
Hey, move!

00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:43.194
Why don't you
take them down right now?!

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.267
Yes!

00:12:44.668 --> 00:12:45.965
What's this...?

00:12:46.604 --> 00:12:47.571
Onizuka did this?

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:49.228
I can't believe it.

00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:52.942
You shouldn't!
Don't believe these montage photos!

00:12:53.544 --> 00:12:55.375
No, these aren't montage.

00:12:56.847 --> 00:12:58.041
They expanded it...

00:12:58.149 --> 00:12:59.411
... but the size of the pixels
is consistent.

00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:01.614
These are real photos.

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:03.680
Hey, they're real.

00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:04.777
So he really did it.

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.857
Vice Principal!
In the gym, too!

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:07.924
What?!

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:09.718
How could he...?!

00:13:09.827 --> 00:13:10.794
Hey!

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:12.624
- There're more on the third floor!
- Let's go!

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:17.560
Why did you volunteer to say that?

00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:20.769
If they check them,
they'll find out soon enough.

00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:22.862
It's better to tell them now
before they figure it out later.

00:13:24.175 --> 00:13:25.335
Other than that,
what do you think?

00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:26.701
What do you mean?

00:13:27.044 --> 00:13:28.068
I mean...

00:13:28.345 --> 00:13:29.972
He'll definitely be fired.

00:13:30.414 --> 00:13:32.314
Everyone has found out
who he really is...

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.714
He did such a disgusting thing.

00:13:34.885 --> 00:13:38.218
Let's kick the immoral teacher
out of our school!

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.850
It's very easy.

00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:48.757
Yeah, he went to Sakurada-sensei.
He remembered that.

00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:50.055
I see.

00:13:51.802 --> 00:13:53.702
Now we can see the connections...

00:13:54.171 --> 00:13:55.229
How was it?

00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:58.170
The meeting with all members
will be held tomorrow.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.037
Hey, what did you find out?

00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:03.476
Yesterday's mess...

00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:05.205
...about the lost money
and other stuff...

00:14:05.316 --> 00:14:08.080
...was preparation for this situation.

00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:09.186
What?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.913
I mean everything was a set-up...

00:14:15.092 --> 00:14:17.151
...to get Onizuka fired.

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:22.023
First, the money collected
wasn't direct deposit but cash only.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:25.162
Sakurada seems to be part of it.
So it was easily done.

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:29.432
Then they had honest Fujiyoshi
collect the money.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.132
When the money was collected,
they stole it from him.

00:14:31.642 --> 00:14:35.373
They put it in Onizuka's pocket
and let Sakurada invite him...

00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:36.878
...to a fake bar.

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:40.446
They took the money from Onizuka
when he was drunk.

00:14:40.918 --> 00:14:42.408
Then they threw him away.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:43.850
Now we have a case...

00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:44.921
...of a teacher embezzling.

00:14:45.623 --> 00:14:47.614
Who on earth would do
such a terrible thing?

00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:49.957
Don't you get it?

00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:51.989
There is only one person
who hates Onizuka...

00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:55.463
...and would set up a trick like this,
like we used to do.

00:14:56.267 --> 00:14:57.234
Aizawa?!

00:14:57.401 --> 00:14:58.663
Correct.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.031
Terrible! It's too terrible!

00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:02.704
Because of that, Fujiyoshi is...!

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:05.175
Hey, Kusano...

00:15:05.709 --> 00:15:10.078
Was Fujiyoshi's note hand-written
or typed with a word processor?

00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:12.648
It wasn't hand-written.

00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:15.910
Does he have a word processor?

00:15:16.487 --> 00:15:17.784
No, he doesn't.

00:15:19.757 --> 00:15:20.781
That's right.

00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:24.020
They must have made it up
in order to back up their plan...

00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:25.287
... but it's poorly done.

00:15:25.729 --> 00:15:27.788
But...
Right now Fujiyoshi is...

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:30.290
They wanted Fujiyoshi to be...

00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:31.925
...somewhere
no one can contact him.

00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:34.764
Maybe they told him about a job
which he had to stay in for a while.

00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:38.899
To make the note trick work,
it is best to kill him...

00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:40.337
You! Kanzaki!

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:43.878
Don't get so serious.
I'm joking of course. Don't yell.

00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:45.642
When you say it,
it doesn't sound like a joke.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.515
Fujiyoshi should be fine.
His role was over.

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:51.855
And...

00:15:52.523 --> 00:15:54.821
...they finished
with the revealing posters.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.889
This is the worst trick.

00:15:58.595 --> 00:15:59.619
Too amateurish.

00:16:00.297 --> 00:16:02.492
Why?! Because of this,
he is in trouble right now!

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.461
Their purpose isn't distributing
montage photos to annoy him.

00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.102
If the genuineness of the photos
is the weapon for the plan...

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:12.500
...their way of doing it is pretty bad.

00:16:12.776 --> 00:16:13.743
What?

00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:15.070
Don't you get it?

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:18.978
Listen. Here are photos
which are put on the board.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.474
That means
someone took the photos...

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:23.052
...and put them on the board.

00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:26.620
If they had stopped
when he used the money...

00:16:26.724 --> 00:16:28.988
... it could be a perfect crime.

00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:31.294
They did too much work...

00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:34.555
...so it's like they're shouting,
"Someone is behind this!"

00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:37.559
They thought they imitated the way
we used to do it, and they won.

00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:39.731
They were ignorant and happy kids.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:44.129
Because of that, we can plot
something against them though.

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:46.843
What are you going to do?

00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:48.300
This photo.

00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:51.380
It's proof
that Onizuka used the money.

00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:54.716
It's also proof that he was set up.

00:16:56.587 --> 00:16:57.554
Finished.

00:16:57.988 --> 00:16:58.955
It's done.

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:00.045
You took more time
than we thought.

00:17:00.157 --> 00:17:01.715
- What's that?
- I made it using software.

00:17:01.825 --> 00:17:03.986
Wait a minute.
It shows up soon. See...

00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:07.430
Wow!

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:10.224
Incredible. It's really taken.

00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:13.565
Hey, Kikuchi,
I have a favor to ask...

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.637
No.

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.631
- This girl...
- What's up, Yoshikawa?

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.002
Yoko Sato of Higashi.

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:22.476
That one is Miki Miura
of the private school, Koyo.

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:25.277
She's hiding with make-up,
but with this mole near her eye...

00:17:25.382 --> 00:17:26.406
...I'm sure that's her.

00:17:26.884 --> 00:17:28.215
She can't deceive my eyes.

00:17:34.058 --> 00:17:36.026
This uniform is
for the Sailor Seven, isn't it?

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.452
Well, if you know them,
it's easy to move forward.

00:17:38.929 --> 00:17:41.989
We'll be busy tonight.
I'm counting on you, everyone.

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:44.057
All right!

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:46.830
No, no, no.

00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:49.901
No suicide, no children's custody,
no missing person, nothing at all...

00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:51.099
...that's all for the report.

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:52.509
Is that right?

00:17:53.577 --> 00:17:55.374
Then I'll be back again later.

00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:56.679
Please continue...

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.747
...to keep your eyes open.

00:17:57.848 --> 00:17:59.179
Eikichi. It's been a while
since the last time...

00:17:59.283 --> 00:18:00.511
...we saw each other.
Is that all now?

00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:01.584
I have a good story, hey!

00:18:03.554 --> 00:18:06.114
How could he
call himself my friend?

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.291
Oh, Uehara.

00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:19.659
Don't walk around
in the middle of night.

00:18:20.137 --> 00:18:21.968
I'm busy.

00:18:22.072 --> 00:18:23.869
It's a waste
to look for him around here.

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:28.003
I'm saying Fujiyoshi isn't here.

00:18:29.246 --> 00:18:30.907
Yes! Excuse me! This way!

00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:32.615
Yes, thank you!

00:18:33.817 --> 00:18:36.251
Hey, long hair! It's time to shift.

00:18:36.353 --> 00:18:37.718
All right!

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:40.313
Fujiyoshi!

00:18:40.824 --> 00:18:42.018
Fujiyoshi!

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:43.150
Teacher!

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.954
- You! Shit!
- What's the matter? Stop it!

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:48.621
You're alive!
Do you have your legs?

00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:50.459
Where are you touching?!

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:51.756
Don't you get it?

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:55.329
You guys were set up by Miyabi.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.101
Oh, I haven't eaten anything
since this morning.

00:19:06.016 --> 00:19:08.985
Is that right?
I did a terrible thing to everyone.

00:19:10.053 --> 00:19:11.680
Why are you telling us...?

00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:14.682
I happened to hear it.
I can't ignore it, can I?

00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:17.421
This isn't like Miyabi.

00:19:17.628 --> 00:19:20.188
Since Onizuka came,
she became weird...

00:19:20.297 --> 00:19:22.322
Listen to me!
You troublemaker!

00:19:23.534 --> 00:19:25.263
Yeah, I'm listening.

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:28.103
In short,
everything is Aizawa's fault.

00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:30.965
Let's pay her back.

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:32.275
Shall we, Fujiyoshi?

00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:35.336
I won't go.

00:19:35.546 --> 00:19:36.513
What?

00:19:36.813 --> 00:19:39.543
Why, Fujiyoshi?
You, too...

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:40.876
I used it...

00:19:40.984 --> 00:19:41.951
What?

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:45.278
I used the money for the trip
to buy this G-Shock...

00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:46.656
What?

00:19:47.257 --> 00:19:50.192
I was thinking of returning it
right away, but I couldn't.

00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:55.159
That's why I couldn't talk back
when they called me a thief.

00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:59.198
Aizawa told me
to work to earn money...

00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:01.363
I felt like
I found something to do...

00:20:02.372 --> 00:20:04.806
I thought I should return
the 50,000 yen I used.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.507
I want to finish my work like a man.

00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:13.216
You're great!

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.681
- You're great, Fujiyoshi!
- Stop, Onizuka!

00:20:15.786 --> 00:20:17.253
- You have guts!
- Wait!

00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:21.118
All right, I have decided, too,
to make 1,070,000 by myself!

00:20:21.925 --> 00:20:23.790
That's impossible.
That's different than my situation...

00:20:23.894 --> 00:20:26.920
I've decided!
I've already decided.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.463
He must be an idiot!

00:20:28.932 --> 00:20:31.833
Hey, you guys.
Do you understand the situation?

00:20:32.369 --> 00:20:34.599
Get serious!

00:20:34.838 --> 00:20:36.169
Salt seaweed is done!

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.007
Anyway...

00:20:38.141 --> 00:20:41.008
... it's too dangerous to have him
here at the school any longer.

00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:44.510
The proof that he used
the money for the school trip...

00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:46.082
... is all here!

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.376
In order to wash away the distrust
spread among students...

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:51.716
...toward the teachers,
he should be fired!

00:20:51.822 --> 00:20:52.846
- Agreed!
- That's right!

00:20:52.956 --> 00:20:55.254
- Yes, that's right!
- We have no choice now.

00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:56.859
Principal,
you need to make a decision now!

00:20:57.027 --> 00:20:59.359
I understand.
I have no choice then.

00:20:59.963 --> 00:21:01.294
Then, Principal...

00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:02.365
No.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.966
What was lost
is the students' money.

00:21:06.703 --> 00:21:09.433
What should be done
to Onizuka-sensei and the lost money...

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:12.906
...the final decision
for these problems should be...

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.377
...made by the students themselves.

00:21:17.814 --> 00:21:18.803
Principal...

00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:22.177
Now we're going to have
an all-school assembly.

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:24.320
Come out, thief teacher!

00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:26.389
Don't mess with us!
Bring Onizuka out!

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.515
What's going on?!

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.855
Return our money!

00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.792
Quit it! Thief teacher!

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:52.806
You can't love everyone

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:56.071
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.315 --> 00:22:00.217
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:05.618
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:10.187
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:14.398
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:22.539
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:27.336
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:32.608
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:36.844
What is there for me to do?

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:40.889
It may be small now

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:45.052
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:48.892
A tear is about to drop

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:53.170
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:57.033
Live strong every moment

00:22:57.242 --> 00:23:03.181
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:20.063
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:22.258
Onizuka!

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:26.796
Hi, everyone. I'm Onizuka,
charged with embezzlement.

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:27.929
Greetings!

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.264
You are a criminal!

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.240
How could you come here
without shame?!

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:38.039
That's interesting.
Let him do it.

00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:46.386
Just watch me.
I'll show you how I finish my work.

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:54.531
SEE YA NEXT TIME
