WEBVTT

00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:11.566
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.316
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:23.834
This street makes me love

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.643
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:33.643
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:39.184
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.084
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:50.259
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:50.364 --> 00:00:55.460
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.868 --> 00:01:00.963
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:06.335
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:12.076
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.246
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:22.911
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.979
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:47.346
Teacher!
What's the name of this shellfish?

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.417
It's called a Chiraga Spider Conch.

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.283
It lives on the rocky
shores around Okinawa.

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:56.082
In the old days, it was used
as a charm to protect against evil.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:57.888
Teacher! What about this?!

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:02.027
Wait a moment.
That is... Let's see...

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:03.786
Can I get a closer look?

00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:04.887
Here!

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.192
Here it is!

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.734
It's called a turban shell.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:13.300
Oh, are you studying
marine biology with your students...

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:14.394
...Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.765
Well, yes...

00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.640
I used to do that, too, when I would
go on outings with the students.

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:26.305
When we observe
living things with the students...

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.840
... I really feel at one with nature...

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.680
Wow, you are,
surprisingly, a romantic.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.116
Sure I am!

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.648
Vice Principal!
There's a big blue fish!

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:40.720
Is that right?

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.353
Wow! It's pretty!

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:46.154
It's called a parrotfish.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:47.262
In Okinawa...

00:02:47.363 --> 00:02:49.694
...it is one of the most popular fish,
along with a double-lined fusilier.

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:52.497
You know a lot...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.701
Don't get too close.
The fish will be afraid.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:59.435
Please admire it from a distance.

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:00.638
I understand.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.170
Look. It is swimming happily.

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:04.399
It's nice.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:08.577
To be gentle in the treatment
of even a small life like this is...

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:15.576
I've got my meal!

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.482
Oni... Oni... Oni...

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:20.220
Yeah! Look at this!

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.981
Wow! Great!
He got it on the first try!

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.024
I was called
a Sea Man at Shonan.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:30.221
Onizuka!

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:32.294
What's up, Vice Principal?

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.257
What are you doing?!

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:38.127
While I'm teaching the students
how important life is...

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:41.668
...you murdered it in front of us!

00:03:42.602 --> 00:03:43.569
Would you like to eat it, too?

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:45.303
I'm going to grill it on the beach.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:47.103
Grill it on the beach?!

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:51.002
It's really good!
Especially this fresh parrotfish.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.802
Oh, Kanzaki?

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:56.738
Leave me alone!

00:03:56.913 --> 00:03:58.278
Because of
your room arrangements...

00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.211
... I couldn't sleep at all!

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.011
I was bothered by Gundam!

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:03.644
Get ready!

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.881
Get ready...?

00:04:10.556 --> 00:04:12.922
A habu's got my penis!

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:15.890
You! Kanzaki!

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.490
Well done! Kanzaki!
I support your doing this!

00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:22.296
Please, someone!
Suck out the poison!

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:26.366
Fu... Fuyutsuki!

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:27.535
What...?

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.593
Please! With your mouth!

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.466
Definitely not!

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.472
Fuyutsuki!!

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.331
Damn that terrorist woman!

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:41.201
I almost needed to cut it off!

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:44.680
I survived because I sucked
it out myself. I can't believe it!

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:46.805
I'm the one who can't believe this!

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:49.639
This is the first time I've seen
such a cheerful person...

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:50.977
...after they were bit by a habu.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:55.152
You deserve it. It's your fault.

00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:57.646
There. It's done.

00:04:58.224 --> 00:05:00.350
Oh, thank you very much...

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:02.817
Please put
the bandage on yourself.

00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:04.487
All right. Thanks...

00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:07.857
You put Gundam fanatics only
in Kanzaki's room, didn't you?

00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:11.163
I don't know why you made
that room arrangement.

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.863
Kanzaki can speak
five different languages...

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.325
... but she complained that...

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:17.460
...she couldn't understand
their conversation at all.

00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:20.538
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.006
Well, in my group
in the chat room...

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:27.632
...the secret treasures in Japan
were once a popular subject.

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:31.176
When I told them I was going
to Ishigaki Island on a school trip...

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.475
...some people
sent me information...

00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:35.378
...about a hidden treasure
on this island.

00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:36.745
Hidden treasure?

00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:38.206
They say it's known as...

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:39.876
...a treasure belonging
to a heretical religious group.

00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:42.483
There is a secret treasure of
the Christians who were in hiding...

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:44.453
...and were led by Shiro Amakusa.

00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:46.421
Some say a part of the treasure...

00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:49.823
...was carried from Shimabara
to Ishigaki Island.

00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:54.595
It's worth close to 2 billion yen
by today's prices.

00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:57.193
2 billion...?

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:01.093
My guess is that this uninhabited
island may be the one...

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.799
Are you saying there is
2 billion on this island?

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:06.200
It's really close to here!

00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:08.270
Of course, it's just my hypothesis.

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:12.643
That's the legend of Shiro Amakusa's
Golden Cross, isn't it?

00:06:13.344 --> 00:06:14.503
Because of the curse...

00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:17.373
... no one has wanted to get
close to that island for a long time.

00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:20.148
It's a common story, isn't it?

00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:22.744
It surely is...

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.114
We can find that kind
of legend anywhere.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.380
Wait!

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:31.912
I can smell strongly...
the scent of real treasure...

00:06:32.357 --> 00:06:34.756
...the smell of 2 billion.!

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:36.918
I told you it's a hypothesis!

00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:39.491
This needs to be
investigated more...

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.093
What are you talking about?

00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.356
A short distance away,
2 billion is lying around.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.396
If we go home empty-handed,
we should be punished.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.869
Onizuka, are you serious?

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:55.233
But if we are going to look
for the hidden treasure...

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.402
...we need a lot of man power.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.009
Don't worry about that!

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.668
Right now, I have plenty
of laborers who work for free.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.904
What?

00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.240
We have 40 young
and healthy ones.

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:14.015
All right!
All classes! Gather here!

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:18.412
Now we're going to see a colony
of Yaeyama Palm Trees.

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:22.659
Listen! Don't disrupt
the group activity.

00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:25.693
Please do not act selfishly...

00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:28.395
What happened to Class 4?

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:32.633
Didn't you give him permission?

00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:34.231
What permission?

00:07:34.436 --> 00:07:37.927
Onizuka-sensei said he got
permission from you a while ago...

00:07:38.204 --> 00:07:40.331
...and he's going to do
some special research.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.901
Special research?

00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:43.441
He said...

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:45.975
...the theme was "What does
the sea turtle's egg taste like?"

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.709
Don't you know about it?

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:50.170
Sea turtle?!

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.111
BIG CATCH

00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:05.590
Aren't we going to Yaeyama?
Why sea turtle?

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:09.088
You had 40 people ride
on such a shabby boat!

00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:10.751
This isn't going to sink, is it?

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.293
I'm scared! Teacher!

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.723
Shut up! Be quiet!

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:21.359
This is noble research
we are doing by studying...

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.959
...the sea turtle's eggs.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.661
If you complain, I'll give you
no points for social science.

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:30.004
What's that?!

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:33.203
The sea turtle belongs to natural
science, not social science!

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:36.505
Shut up! That's an order
from your homeroom teacher!

00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:41.646
Like I thought, it's not
a good idea to deceive everyone...

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.547
...and use them
for treasure hunting...

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:49.153
If we find the treasure
and take them to Hawaii...

00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:50.483
... no one will complain.

00:08:51.357 --> 00:08:55.554
Besides, everyone seriously
thinks this is special research...

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.826
If there are still
some who complain...

00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:02.295
...I'll have them buried
in the hole they have dug.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.525
The hole worth 2 billion.!

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.931
I can't stop him...

00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:15.238
What are you scheming?

00:09:18.643 --> 00:09:20.405
What are you doing?!

00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:23.309
- What a great turn of events!
- Kanzaki! Help!

00:09:23.414 --> 00:09:25.278
- Watch out, Onizuka!
- Hey! Help!

00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:27.880
What are you going to do, Anko?

00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:30.713
I don't know what's going on,
but just watch us!

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:34.120
All right!
Let's play Shiritori (word game)!

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.679
Doriya!

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:40.721
I don't want to play!

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:41.792
Hey! Hey!

00:09:41.993 --> 00:09:45.018
You guys! Show some happiness
about being in the forest!

00:09:45.228 --> 00:09:46.195
Shall we sing?!

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.530
We're not in a forest,
we're in a jungle!

00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:51.629
I don't have the energy to sing.

00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.925
How far do we need to go?

00:09:54.402 --> 00:09:57.336
According to this map,
it's about 2 km more.

00:09:57.538 --> 00:10:00.267
Two kilometers?!
Are we going to walk some more?

00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:04.599
I don't care about the sea turtles!
I want to go back to the hotel!

00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:06.733
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:10.876
If you want to go back,
suit yourself!

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.378
But you get no points
in social science.

00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:17.712
He must be a real idiot!

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.587
I wonder if it is really okay
to come this far by ourselves...

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.317
Uh... spooky...

00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:35.092
Yoshikawa?

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.558
Hey! Step it up!

00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:40.793
Onizuka!

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.667
Vice Principal!

00:10:45.105 --> 00:10:46.265
It's dangerous!

00:10:46.372 --> 00:10:49.829
Please don't go in the water
on a jet ski, and then get on this boat!

00:10:51.243 --> 00:10:55.406
Shut up! Why would I get
on such a slow boat?!

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:59.310
If the students get lost
because of that man...

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:03.282
...what am I going to do?
It will be my responsibility!

00:11:03.918 --> 00:11:06.113
I'll save the students
with my own two hands...

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.849
...and this time I'll kick him out
of the school forever! Watch me!

00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:13.751
Onizuka!

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:16.593
Where are you going?!

00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:22.633
The island Onizuka-sensei headed for
was this island! Vice Principal!

00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:30.159
HABUTO POKOCHIN
(HABU AND PENIS)

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:37.051
Listen! The turtles' eggs are
buried very deep in the ground!

00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.597
You should dig
at least two meters deep!

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.431
This is strange...

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.904
When I watched on TV before...

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.739
...I thought sea turtles
were laying eggs in the sand...

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.314
Oh, another thing!
If you find an old box...

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:54.347
...it is dangerous.
So do not open it!

00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:57.751
But let me know immediately!
Understand?!

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:03.851
Teacher. It's better to stop...

00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:08.023
If we don't find anything,
the class will kill you!

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:10.560
Well, if nothing comes of it...

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:12.966
...we can blame the destruction
of their habitat or something...

00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:14.402
...and we can avoid the issue.

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:16.940
As long as we can
find the treasure...

00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:21.841
I can't help...

00:12:22.213 --> 00:12:23.544
Kikuchi...

00:12:24.082 --> 00:12:26.983
I have something to ask you...

00:12:27.886 --> 00:12:32.289
Teacher! Something strange,
like a chunk of iron, is buried here!

00:12:32.524 --> 00:12:33.491
What?!

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:35.819
Let me see!

00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:38.322
What's this?

00:12:39.063 --> 00:12:40.621
That's probably
an unexploded bomb.

00:12:40.765 --> 00:12:43.325
Oh, an unexploded bomb...
The sea turtle.... Wow!

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:44.502
Bomb?!

00:12:44.602 --> 00:12:46.263
What?! Bomb?!

00:12:46.804 --> 00:12:51.002
Shut up! It's called an unexploded
bomb because it doesn't explode.

00:12:51.109 --> 00:12:54.340
You don't need to worry about it!
Work hard!

00:12:54.445 --> 00:12:56.743
If you are not working,
you will lose your lunch!

00:12:56.848 --> 00:12:58.042
No way!

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:02.513
Shoot! Why did I have to come
to Okinawa to dig a hole?!

00:13:03.388 --> 00:13:07.154
I will report Onizuka to UNICEF
for mistreatment of children!

00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:09.082
Oh, I can't go any further.

00:13:09.194 --> 00:13:12.925
I'm so thirsty.
Don't you have any juice?

00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:14.086
We already drank it all!

00:13:14.432 --> 00:13:18.801
What? Oh, I'm going to die!

00:13:21.372 --> 00:13:24.000
Here. You can drink this.

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:25.976
Thank you...

00:13:29.714 --> 00:13:34.276
Teacher! I've found
something like a box!

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:36.885
What?! Really?!

00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:38.956
Where is it?!

00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:42.024
There, down there,
it looks like a box...

00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:43.824
Which one is it?!

00:13:43.928 --> 00:13:45.725
Where is it? Where?!

00:13:51.302 --> 00:13:53.770
You, Kanzaki!
What are you doing?!

00:13:54.973 --> 00:13:56.770
Here we go!

00:13:57.242 --> 00:13:59.472
What are you doing?! Stop it!

00:14:02.113 --> 00:14:03.842
What are you doing, Kanzaki?

00:14:04.315 --> 00:14:06.476
Don't play innocent!

00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:09.645
We have the evidence.

00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:14.682
Evidence? I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.694
Kikuchi confessed everything.

00:14:17.862 --> 00:14:20.524
He said the special
research was a big lie!

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.497
You used
and abused us as laborers...

00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:26.434
... in order to find
the buried treasure, didn't you?

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:32.036
Hey, Kikuchi!
You sold me out to them!

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:35.337
What are you talking about?
I'm tied up. Look.

00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:37.778
Look at what?! The rope is loose!

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:40.747
Everyone, what do you want to do?

00:14:40.918 --> 00:14:44.479
Should we just execute him?

00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:46.180
Yeah!

00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:48.285
Hey, wait a minute!

00:14:48.593 --> 00:14:50.060
I wasn't going to cheat you!

00:14:50.228 --> 00:14:53.561
If we found the treasure,
I was going to share it equally...

00:14:53.998 --> 00:14:55.226
Hey!

00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:57.032
It's true!

00:14:57.402 --> 00:15:00.394
All right, all right! I'll stop
the treasure hunt immediately!

00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:04.473
Please! I'll do anything!
Please forgive me this time!

00:15:06.244 --> 00:15:07.506
Hey, Kanzaki!

00:15:10.148 --> 00:15:13.242
For some time, since we've been
here, I've been a little worried...

00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:14.408
About what?

00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:17.484
I can't find them although I've
been looking for them for a while...

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:20.414
Yoshikawa, Uehara, and the others.

00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:25.389
Hey, walk quickly!

00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:29.723
You want me to,
but with a blindfold...

00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:34.066
Shut up! Don't complain!
Yoshikawa doesn't deserve it!

00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:37.804
But you've thought
of an outrageous plan!

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:40.707
You'll have Yoshikawa get lost!

00:15:40.812 --> 00:15:42.473
If we have a victim
on a distant island...

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.877
...in the Southern sea like this...

00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:45.414
...it will be the homeroom
teacher's responsibility.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.885
I bet Onizuka is panicking now...
We're missing.!

00:15:51.522 --> 00:15:55.390
Hey, we came pretty far.
Isn't it far enough?

00:15:55.493 --> 00:15:56.517
All right!

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.131
Sorry, but we'll leave you here.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.334
We'll loosen the rope for you
so you'll be able to get away.

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.667
Now, sit right there!

00:16:10.308 --> 00:16:14.404
Well, if you're lucky, you'll survive.
If you're lucky.!

00:16:16.447 --> 00:16:20.144
If you want to blame someone,
blame Onizuka! See you!

00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:21.750
Bye-bye!

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:35.660
It serves him right!
It's just Yoshikawa.

00:16:35.767 --> 00:16:38.497
It's his fault for pulling
such a trick on us.

00:16:38.603 --> 00:16:40.764
He must be crying right now.

00:16:41.372 --> 00:16:44.864
But is it really all right
to leave him in this jungle?

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:48.810
If he loses his way back,
he may really die.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.908
It doesn't matter.

00:16:51.349 --> 00:16:55.251
Society doesn't
need that crybaby.

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:58.555
You must really hate him.

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:03.322
He makes me irritated.
He does whatever others say.

00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:05.622
It's like "Please pick on me!"

00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:08.691
That's terrible, Anko.

00:17:12.503 --> 00:17:13.561
What?

00:17:14.672 --> 00:17:17.140
How did you get ahead of us?

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:21.578
What? I've just been
sitting here the whole time.

00:17:21.946 --> 00:17:25.473
What? Then we must
have taken a wrong path.

00:17:25.783 --> 00:17:27.182
It is strange...

00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:29.548
That's right! This way!

00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:31.554
I see. Sorry!

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:36.115
We almost got ourselves lost...

00:17:39.263 --> 00:17:40.457
Why?

00:17:41.632 --> 00:17:43.395
Strange... There is no way...

00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:46.870
Why?!

00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:49.937
There is no way.!

00:17:54.212 --> 00:17:58.581
Wait a minute!
This means we are also...?

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.081
... lost?

00:18:04.422 --> 00:18:07.585
Why didn't anyone mark the way?!

00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:10.956
If we get lost, it isn't even funny!

00:18:11.062 --> 00:18:12.029
What?!

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:16.557
It's your fault!

00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:20.593
Because you tricked us
like that with Onizuka.!

00:18:21.072 --> 00:18:22.972
What are you going to do?!

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.973
It's your fault! We got lost!

00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:28.308
If I hadn't had on a blindfold...

00:18:28.412 --> 00:18:30.744
... I might have
remembered the way back...

00:18:31.082 --> 00:18:32.140
You're a man!

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.411
Don't make any excuses,
and do something!

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.280
You're a man, aren't you?!

00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:38.419
It's not fair.

00:18:38.523 --> 00:18:41.219
When you need something,
you call me a man.

00:18:41.959 --> 00:18:46.191
What are we going to do?!
Can't we ever go home again?!

00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:48.595
No! I don't like that!

00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:49.723
Hey!

00:18:50.034 --> 00:18:51.934
Don't yell so loudly!

00:18:54.805 --> 00:18:56.466
Calm down, everyone!

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.846
Anyway, let's calm down
and find the way out. Okay?

00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:05.939
How can you talk like
such an authority?!

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.143
You're just Yoshikawa!
Don't act like a man!

00:19:08.386 --> 00:19:11.446
You say "Be a man"
and "Don't act like a man!"

00:19:11.556 --> 00:19:13.353
Which is it?!

00:19:13.457 --> 00:19:15.550
Shut up!

00:19:24.168 --> 00:19:25.135
Hey, Anko.

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:26.669
Are you sure this is the right way?

00:19:26.804 --> 00:19:28.772
The trees are getting thicker...

00:19:28.973 --> 00:19:31.100
I don't know!

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.406
Hey, this is
a tropical island, isn't it?

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:37.273
Then there must be tigers
and cheetahs, right?

00:19:39.317 --> 00:19:41.581
I don't think so.

00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:44.812
How do you know?!
You're just Yoshikawa!

00:19:48.459 --> 00:19:49.426
Look!

00:19:49.527 --> 00:19:51.688
It's the end of the jungle!
It's the way out!

00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:54.454
Yeah! We did it! We'll live!

00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:00.926
It can't be true...

00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:02.333
This is the ocean!

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.176
What?! Where are we?!

00:20:06.377 --> 00:20:08.368
We must be at the opposite side...

00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:10.912
Hey, do something!

00:20:11.015 --> 00:20:14.542
It was your idea to let
Yoshikawa get lost!

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:16.512
Take some responsibility!

00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:18.987
Shut up!

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.059
I get it! You'll be happy
if you can go home! Right?

00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:26.395
Hey! Where are you going?! Anko!

00:20:27.264 --> 00:20:28.856
If I go along the shore...

00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:31.230
... I may get back
to the place we landed.

00:20:31.636 --> 00:20:33.934
It's dangerous! Come back!

00:20:34.872 --> 00:20:35.896
I'm okay...

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.237
Are you all right?

00:20:43.347 --> 00:20:44.905
Yeah! I'm fine!

00:20:51.489 --> 00:20:53.787
Hey! I can hear people's voices!

00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.449
Someone may be down there...

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:03.960
Wow! She fell in!

00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:05.966
What shall we do?!

00:21:06.837 --> 00:21:07.929
Yoshikawa?!

00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:30.394
Yoshikawa!

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:54.938
Where is our future going?

00:21:55.048 --> 00:22:01.783
Maybe it knows of this aimless journey
And simply flew away

00:22:02.722 --> 00:22:09.059
If you can stop our gloomy days

00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:16.132
I will listen to all you say

00:22:17.237 --> 00:22:23.801
However much we have,
There is always something lacking

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.278
The wind will always blow
And carry the scent away

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:38.152
I am searching for our future now

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:44.821
Don't laugh because
It may really go away

00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:52.567
Remember these
Strained words I say

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.738
The night is almost over,
So let's run through this moment

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.976
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:07.080
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:11.048
Before the endless night begins

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:15.653
Embrace this precious night

00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:18.023
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:21.294
Why are you mean to me?

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:27.702
Yoshikawa! Uehara!
Where are you?!

00:23:30.543 --> 00:23:32.602
Where are you?!

00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:36.348
Of course I can't do it!

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:37.449
Uehara-san...

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.050
No! I won't go!

00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:40.185
Miss Uehara!
