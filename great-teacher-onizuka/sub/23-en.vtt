GOTTSUANDESU
(It was a really nice meal)

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:46.761
Fuyutsuki got a love letter!

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.392
Oh, good morning.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.866
Nothing has changed.
No one thinks of what I need.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.532
It's a sign of how popular you are.

00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:56.767
Onizuka-sensei received some, too.

00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:04.344
Great! Are these all mine?

00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:06.477
I must be popular.

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:10.054
But these are all postcards.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:13.588
I wasn't sure
if I should give these to you...

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.628
...and I was holding them until now.

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:19.393
They've accumulated this much.
Cursed chain letters.

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:23.660
Cursed chain letters?

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:26.329
Chain letters?

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:27.374
TO KUNIO MURAI

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:31.237
Yes. Finally it came to me.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.976
Hmm...let me see.

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:36.407
"This is a cursed chain letter.

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:41.580
"Please send the same letter
to 13 people within 24 hours.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.053
"If you don't, bad things will happen
to you and your family...

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:47.593
"...one after another.

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:50.595
On the seventh day,
death will visit you."

00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:52.154
You have many enemies.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:53.324
Oh, shut up!

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:57.126
It is an interesting trick based
on human psychology.

00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:00.071
The one who wrote the letter
must be a fool.

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:03.840
What? Don't you know
the curse of this letter?

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:07.072
I've heard it's the reason why Morita,
on the soccer team, broke a bone...

00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:09.283
... he didn't write the chain letter.

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:10.773
What? Are you serious?

00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:12.682
Yeah, I've heard that, too.

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.985
A student's house burned down
after he burned a chain letter.

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:18.046
Wow..!

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:23.661
I have no choice but to write
the letters. I don't want to be cursed.

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.428
What?

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:30.199
What are you doing?

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:35.235
Don't get caught up in this.

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.204
You're just a spectator.
What are you gonna do if I get cursed?

00:03:39.513 --> 00:03:40.639
Spectator?

00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:43.781
Oh, these..!

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:47.920
These are the chain letters
that came to me. 233 in total.

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:54.159
Oh, no...

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:56.019
I can't take this.

00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:58.291
You will definitely be cursed,
Onizuka.

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.731
The curse from the chain letters
says you'll die on the seventh day.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.535
Are you serious?

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:08.040
When I was playing
Kokkuri-san (occult game)...

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:10.406
...you told me that's superstition.

00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:13.207
Kokkuri-san and chain letters
are different!

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:16.544
You talk about curses and haunting.
They aren't real.

00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:19.381
They are just superstition.
Superstition.

00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.746
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:28.494
Look. It's the curse!
The chain letter's curse has started.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.826
I will be cursed, too.

00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:32.927
Don't worry, Murai.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.560
If you send the letters,
you won't be cursed.

00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:38.967
How could this be a curse?

00:04:39.506 --> 00:04:42.737
The flame burned my butt.
Ouch!

00:04:43.577 --> 00:04:45.670
Damn! It hurts.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.911
I wonder how it looks.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.084
DEATH

00:04:55.155 --> 00:04:56.213
Death?!

00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:02.285
The curse from the chain letter
says you'll die on the seventh day.

00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:05.697
Can't, can't be...

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:23.639
Oh, I'm sorry, Mister.

00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:28.882
THIS WEEK'S HOROSCOPE

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:31.049
"If you are born
under the sign of Leo...

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:33.092
"...you'll get into unexpected trouble.

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:36.888
Money, love, all the worst.
Watch out for accidents."

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:41.193
I certainly won't have any luck.

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:44.532
Maybe I shouldn't get
on my motorcycle this week.

00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:45.867
Watch out!

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.822
As they said,
I've been seriously cursed.

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:09.590
See you later.

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:11.521
TO KUNIO MURAI

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:13.763
What's this?

00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:21.932
Hey, Kikuchi.

00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:25.773
This morning I received
another weird letter.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.137
Like this?

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:28.974
You, too?

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.309
I suspect everyone
in this class received it.

00:06:47.234 --> 00:06:48.223
Onizuka.

00:06:48.435 --> 00:06:49.868
What are you wearing?

00:06:50.237 --> 00:06:53.206
Isn't it obvious?
To ward off evil.

00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:56.376
I mean to keep myself away
from the chain letter curse.

00:06:56.977 --> 00:06:59.070
Just as I thought! It was you!

00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:02.744
You must be the one who distributed
the weird chain letters in this class.

00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:06.278
Why do you say that?

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:09.215
Well, look at it carefully.

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.114
You misspelled "curse."
You used the character for "spicy."

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:13.250
MISFORTUNE

00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:17.156
You're the only one
who could make such a mistake.

00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:21.529
How do you read it? Spiced?

00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:25.135
We'll be spiced within seven days?
What does it mean?

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:31.808
I see. Even if we eat hot curry
or noodle, we won't taste the spice.

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:36.246
I had no choice.
Seriously, I'll be killed by the curse.

00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:39.546
How could you, as a teacher,
betray your own students?

00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:43.250
Oh, no. My left shoulder
suddenly feels pain!

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.449
I feel like something is on it.

00:07:45.992 --> 00:07:50.190
It may be the mizuko curse.

00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:53.523
Shut up. I'm telling you,
I'm still a virgin.

00:07:55.836 --> 00:08:00.933
You made fun of me yesterday.
Just put a magnetic pad on it.

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:03.273
A magnetic pad?

00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:10.713
Do you think those charms
can really take away all the curses?

00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:12.213
What?

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:17.315
If you are doing it,
you might as well do it all.

00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:19.218
Do it all?

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:27.363
Like this. Is this enough?

00:08:27.534 --> 00:08:29.934
No, you haven't written
on everything yet.

00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:32.267
Don't you know the story
of Miminashi Hoichi?

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:34.068
What?! This place, too?

00:08:34.708 --> 00:08:38.109
That's right. Hmm... Perfect!

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:44.645
Whew... I almost became
no-Chin (penis) Teacher Onizuka.

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:50.880
Excuse me, could you be
a bit more quiet, Onizuka-sen..?

00:08:55.729 --> 00:08:57.287
Oh, well...this...

00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:06.599
Oh, no, Fuyutsuki. I can explain.

00:09:06.873 --> 00:09:08.306
Go away.

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:09.839
Ouch!

00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:15.436
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:16.573
Ouch, ouch!

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.708
Don't move.

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:22.087
Oh, shit. I've really been receiving
the letter's curse.

00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:24.615
Fuyutsuki hates me now.

00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:28.486
It's a coincidence. Coincidence.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:31.325
When coincidence happens
again and again...

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:34.765
... people tend to think
there is a special meaning.

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:36.700
It's written in Jung's book.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.799
How could the scar become
a death symbol?

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:42.368
Look at this.

00:09:42.976 --> 00:09:45.376
This character's left side
and right side are switched.

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:50.342
That's why it becomes "death"
when reflected in a mirror.

00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:52.251
Oh, this means...

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:55.186
... I will die on the sixth day
if I don't do anything.

00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:57.185
Hmm. No choice.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.850
I can introduce you
to a good person.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.649
Good person?

00:10:01.862 --> 00:10:05.195
Yes, it's the perfect person
for you in the current situation.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.098
How do you know this place?

00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:11.027
Never mind. This way.

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.146
Excuse me. We are here
to ask you to cast away evil.

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:27.250
Eroim essaim, eroim essaim,
ekoeko azaraku, ekoeko azaraku...

00:10:28.054 --> 00:10:29.146
Oh, shaman.

00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:39.758
I've been waiting for you.

00:10:41.968 --> 00:10:43.333
Welcome.

00:10:47.374 --> 00:10:49.899
It is a curse!

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:01.600
Is he okay?

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:04.001
I can see the death sign
on his face.

00:11:04.438 --> 00:11:08.568
Pulse 460,
and blood pressure 400.

00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:10.041
Are you still a human being?

00:11:10.344 --> 00:11:14.246
Isn't it better to go home
in Nebula M78 (Ultraman's home)?

00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:17.873
It's a curse.
A curse from the chain letter.

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:22.221
What could've made him this ill,
Kanzaki?

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:25.688
Nothing.
We just went to cast out the evil.

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:29.757
I guess it had a negative effect
on a person like him...

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.627
...who's simpleminded.

00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:34.464
I've brought medicine
from the infirmary.

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:37.364
If he is sick,
he'd better take something.

00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:41.101
That's right. Rather than
discussing the curse right now...

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:44.167
... it may be better to lower his blood
pressure by giving him Nifedipine.

00:11:49.783 --> 00:11:51.910
READ THE INSTRUCTIONS
CAREFULLY BEFORE USE.
USE ONLY AS DIRECTED.

00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:53.476
If I had this much,
I guess something should work.

00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:55.852
Idiot. You took too much...

00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:58.117
Onizuka!

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.716
Sensei!

00:12:02.196 --> 00:12:04.630
KICHIJOJI HOSPITAL

00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:06.331
Hmmm.

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:08.363
How does it look, Doc?

00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:10.827
Is something wrong with me?

00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:12.932
Something wrong?

00:12:13.007 --> 00:12:16.636
With that pulse and blood pressure,
you should have been dead.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.702
Anyway, we need to hospitalize you
for a few days for observation.

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.676
What? Hospitalization?

00:12:22.182 --> 00:12:24.207
Yes, hospitalization.

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:31.385
Until yesterday I had no problem,
but now I'm in the hospital.

00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.926
That means
the curse is getting to me...

00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:37.293
I heard the shadow clearly
appeared in the x-ray.

00:12:37.364 --> 00:12:40.663
Poor thing. It's the last stage
of cancer, isn't it?

00:12:40.768 --> 00:12:42.929
He has at most one month...

00:12:43.437 --> 00:12:45.166
I heard he's a teacher.

00:12:46.073 --> 00:12:49.008
Anyway, we have to take care
of him until he dies.

00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:52.436
Teacher? Is it me?

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:54.707
No way.

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:57.214
I had no problems until yesterday.

00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:02.748
This is...

00:13:08.328 --> 00:13:09.386
Excuse me.

00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:11.631
Are you all right, Onizuka-sensei?

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:16.536
Onizuka-sensei?

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.504
Oh, Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:24.105
Life is a temporary existence,
isn't it?

00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:29.644
What's the matter with you,
Onizuka-sensei?

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.942
I'm sorry.

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:33.448
I just panicked.

00:13:35.756 --> 00:13:40.455
I've heard I have cancer
and only have a month to live.

00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:45.392
No way. It can't be true. Onizuka.

00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:47.957
May I ask you for a little time?

00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:55.798
He isn't anywhere.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.374
Yeah, he isn't at the hospital, either.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:01.306
He cleaned up his room.

00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:05.449
What was he thinking?
He disappeared without a word.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.744
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.416
Do you know anything?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.748
What?

00:14:10.924 --> 00:14:12.016
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:13.416
Well...

00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:15.428
What is it? Tell us!

00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:17.964
As a matter of fact...

00:14:19.867 --> 00:14:21.596
...Onizuka-sensei has...

00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.164
...cancer, I guess.

00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:31.271
That's a lie, isn't it?

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:37.508
Yesterday, after the diagnosis,
he had to be hospitalized.

00:14:37.618 --> 00:14:41.520
Onizuka saw his own x-ray...

00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:46.252
There were many white spots
around his chest.

00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:48.521
How could he know it was cancer?

00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:54.326
He heard the doctors saying
that he wouldn't live long.

00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:55.893
No way.

00:14:57.337 --> 00:15:00.431
Serves him right.
Who could have imagined it?

00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:03.238
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:03.644 --> 00:15:08.343
That a cockroach, which is hard
to kill, could die so easily.

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:12.016
Once again, we don't have
a homeroom teacher in Class 3-4.

00:15:12.686 --> 00:15:14.244
Miyabi, you..!

00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:17.421
What? Is there anything
you want to say?

00:15:19.393 --> 00:15:20.382
Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:15:22.563 --> 00:15:26.465
You disappeared without saying
good-bye... Onizuka-sensei...

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.068
Where did you go?

00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.872
You're nice. You're big.

00:15:38.412 --> 00:15:39.401
Stop it!

00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:43.109
Drink as much as you want.

00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:47.913
This is my farewell party!

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.864
- He isn't here, is he?
- No.

00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:01.260
Hey, I can't see.

00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:02.726
Sorry.

00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:06.771
- He isn't here.
- Hopeless.

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:10.234
All right!

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:14.003
Toru, you look good!

00:16:16.283 --> 00:16:20.185
It's my best!

00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:23.619
COMPUTER LAB

00:16:31.498 --> 00:16:32.465
This is...

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:37.063
Oops.

00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:40.536
Oh, tobacco...

00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:44.966
Ouch.

00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:52.981
I'm gonna die anyway.

00:16:53.687 --> 00:16:56.815
It's a pity to die a virgin.

00:16:58.058 --> 00:16:59.252
This time...

00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:02.519
Onizuka!

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:08.093
Fuyutsuki!

00:17:10.904 --> 00:17:13.771
You've made us worry.
Where were you?

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:17.409
Leave me alone.
I'm already...

00:17:17.477 --> 00:17:18.466
Don't run away.

00:17:19.746 --> 00:17:21.907
You don't die.

00:17:23.216 --> 00:17:27.380
You've always cheated death.

00:17:27.888 --> 00:17:31.085
If you believe in the cure,
it will cure you.

00:17:31.658 --> 00:17:35.116
People often say
"illness is a state of mind."

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:39.560
How can you say such a thing
like that to a dying man?

00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:44.999
Look at this. I've bought
a lot of Agaricus mushrooms.

00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:46.437
They are good for cancer.

00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:49.940
And Monta Mino said on TV...

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:56.249
... Miso soup is good, too.
I'll make it with the mushrooms.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.711
I'll make it every day.

00:18:02.889 --> 00:18:04.220
So...

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:10.730
So even if there isn't much time left,
don't give up!

00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:12.821
Fuyutsuki.

00:18:32.185 --> 00:18:33.311
Hey, Kikuchi!

00:18:33.387 --> 00:18:34.376
Murai!

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:36.545
What's the matter, Kikuchi?

00:18:37.224 --> 00:18:40.352
Yoshikawa, Kanzaki,
where is Onizuka?

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.628
He isn't anywhere.

00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:44.493
Don't worry about that,
I found out about it.

00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:45.531
What?

00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:50.860
Onizuka's illness.
I hacked the hospital records.

00:18:51.638 --> 00:18:54.471
What he thinks
is the cursed cancer...

00:18:55.642 --> 00:18:57.769
Wait, Onizuka.

00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:00.006
I need to mentally prepare myself...

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.344
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.847
But here...

00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.109
Fuyutsuki...

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.725
I understand you've agreed.
Okay?

00:19:13.894 --> 00:19:16.158
I have no regrets in my life.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.431
Sensei!

00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:24.726
Sensei!

00:19:24.805 --> 00:19:25.829
Everyone!

00:19:26.173 --> 00:19:28.266
I've found Onizuka-sensei!

00:19:28.508 --> 00:19:30.772
Onizuka-sensei. Are you all right?

00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:33.741
That's cruel.

00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:35.172
Onizuka!

00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:36.874
You all!

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.350
What are you doing?

00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:43.052
Teacher. You don't have cancer.

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:49.452
But I saw the x-ray.
There were many white spots on it.

00:19:49.796 --> 00:19:53.425
They were... Turn around
and show us your back.

00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.535
Like this? What?

00:19:56.803 --> 00:19:59.203
The white spots are those
magnetic pads.

00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:02.067
Cancer never shows up so clearly.

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.675
Really?

00:20:03.777 --> 00:20:07.304
I've checked the hospital records.
They didn't find any cancer.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.177
Then why did they put me
in the hospital?

00:20:09.616 --> 00:20:11.880
When your pulse
and blood pressure have...

00:20:11.952 --> 00:20:14.386
...such abnormal results,
they can't send you home.

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:18.417
Is that all? I'm not going to die?

00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:20.850
Wow. I did it!

00:20:21.228 --> 00:20:24.322
Onizuka-sensei!

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:36.134
Hey, Fuyutsuki...
Please, let's put this behind us.

00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:37.676
Leave me alone!

00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:43.539
I've always thought
curses were a hoax.

00:20:43.783 --> 00:20:45.410
How could he say that?

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:48.317
Curses don't work for Onizuka...

00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:51.525
... he's like
an indestructible cockroach.

00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:57.725
But I wonder who began
the chain letter in the first place?

00:20:57.797 --> 00:20:59.492

00:21:05.672 --> 00:21:07.139
All right.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.398
What?

00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:11.443
Oh, no. A chain letter again!

00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:14.006
Do I need to send it
to 13 people again?

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.073
Hmmm. I have only
my classmates' addresses.

00:21:19.052 --> 00:21:23.546
Onizuka-sensei, Kikuchi, Yoshikawa...

00:21:23.623 --> 00:21:25.614
Tomoko! Hurry up!

00:21:25.692 --> 00:21:28.525
Yes! I'm coming!
