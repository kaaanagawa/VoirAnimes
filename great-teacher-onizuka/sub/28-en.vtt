WEBVTT

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:11.544
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.674
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:23.683
This street makes me love

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.452
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:32.591
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.930
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:43.241
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:48.809
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.451
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.659
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:06.025
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:11.193
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:19.073
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:22.646
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.446
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:43.591
Who are you?!

00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:48.317
I represent the Magazine Glossy
Princess Contest! In short, MGPC!

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:49.790
MGPC?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.298
Yes. We'll introduce
all 12 girls in our magazine.

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:59.771
We'll ask our readers to vote
for the top star of the 21st century.

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:03.775
The winner will appear
in a 20-page layout...

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:07.004
... in our magazine,
and we'll give her full support.

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:10.176
We want her to compete.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:13.677
Now we are going to start
a press conference...

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:16.119
...for the Magazine
Glossy Princess Contest.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.384
We're going to introduce the 12 girls
competing in the contest.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.927
Entry number one, Kyoko Sasaki.

00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:25.858
Nice to be here.

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.362
Entry number two, Miki Wakamatsu.

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm Miki Wakamatsu.

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:37.403
Entry number nine, Kaori Ueda.

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.911
- She isn't here yet?
- I'll do my best.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.538
- As usual, she's slow...
- Entry number ten, Yuko Nagashima.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.909
- I ask for your support!
- I'm sorry...

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:48.082
Hurry up! Your turn is coming up!

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.155
Yes!

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.349
Entry number eleven,
Megumi Hoshino.

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.024
Megumi Hoshino.
I'm 17 years old.

00:02:55.128 --> 00:02:56.959
Oh, no! It's not her turn yet...!

00:02:57.064 --> 00:03:01.057
I can't believe I've been invited
to compete in such a big event.

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:02.692
I'll do my best in the contest.

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.464
I ask for your support!

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:11.735
What is she doing?

00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:16.740
Wow!

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:22.579
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.021
- What on earth is she doing?!
- Are you okay?

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.563
I'm fine.

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.358
Are you all right?

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.530
Protect those boobs!

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.372
Entry number twelve,
Tomoko Nomura.

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.799
Tomo-chan...

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.810
That's it. These are the twelve.

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:48.676
What were you thinking?

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.410
Tomoko is not a comedian!

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:53.918
You gave her
cheap encouragement!

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:59.423
I'm fine, Manager-san.
I like comedy, too.

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.392
Are you listening to me?!

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:05.963
In a situation like that, it's better
to be the center of attention.

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.200
Look.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:11.061
TOROKO IS IN FACT SLOW

00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:13.867
Toroko is already one step ahead.

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:16.602
I don't think
readers of this magazine...

00:04:16.743 --> 00:04:18.472
... read sports newspapers.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:19.846
Oh...?

00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:23.109
Teacher, did you give anyone
an address for Tomoko's fan letters?

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.289
Yeah, the publisher asked me, so...

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.258
It's Toroko's home address.

00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:40.662
What were you thinking?!

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.201
Her fans will swarm her home!

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.865
It wasn't me!
I faxed the office address. Really!

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:50.943
But it's likely that teacher...

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:54.913
... might have faxed
our class registry by mistake...

00:04:55.148 --> 00:04:57.139
What are you going to do with this?!

00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.111
Oh, shut up!

00:05:00.454 --> 00:05:04.049
It only says "Address for fan letters."

00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:06.822
If they don't know
this is her home address...

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:08.224
... nothing will happen.

00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:13.765
I'm now in front of
a Ramen Restaurant in Kichijoji...

00:05:14.034 --> 00:05:18.095
This isn't a restaurant
with the longest waiting line in Japan.

00:05:18.205 --> 00:05:21.971
It is the result of new star
Tomoko Nomura's address...

00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:24.908
... being published
in Shonen Magazine this week.

00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:28.875
It has become a huge disturbance,
with fans and media...

00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:31.212
... in front of Nomura-san's home.

00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:34.181
Despite Nomura-san
being unknown to the public...

00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:38.348
... it's becoming a serious problem
here, and police have been called.

00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:41.393
It is because the magazine
has a circulation of five million.

00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:43.787
Some say
Nomura-san's production team...

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:46.161
...put down her address on purpose.

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:49.099
That's the only
reasonable explanation.

00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:50.726
- It's selling her name.
- Onizuka-san, they know now!

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:53.234
Because of this,
I've been busy...

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.604
... responding to the media
since this morning!

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.507
But you have time to come here...

00:06:00.747 --> 00:06:03.614
This is the only place
the media doesn't know about!

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:08.749
Don't make a fuss.
It isn't cool, Okkie!

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.222
Not cool?!
Whose fault is that?!

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:16.118
Don't you remember our goal?

00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:20.499
We're going to make Toroko
the top star of Glossy Princess.

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:23.666
That's our ultimate goal.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.796
We can't choose
our strategy right now!

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.901
Teacher! Today's magazine!

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:33.906
The first results of the voting
are published in today's magazine.

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:36.848
You can complain after you see it.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:40.116
This is...!

00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:43.122
12th PLACE: TOMOKO NOMURA

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:45.948
She's at the bottom...

00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:51.185
Don't worry about the ranking...
Beautiful sky...

00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:54.092
Don't change the subject!

00:06:56.203 --> 00:06:58.103
Good! Good!

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:03.637
The main readers of the magazines
are young students.

00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:07.679
They don't like
sensational accidents like that.

00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:08.975
I guess...

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.176
It's too late to analyze that.

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:15.149
Thank you, that's all!

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:18.982
Thank you very much.
Excuse me!

00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:22.226
First of all...

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:23.887
...are you seriously thinking...

00:07:23.997 --> 00:07:25.362
...about Tomo-chan?!

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:28.900
Of course!
Toroko is my student!

00:07:29.002 --> 00:07:30.629
I think of her as my top priority.

00:07:30.737 --> 00:07:32.830
It's a lie! It's definitely a lie!

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:33.997
DRESSING ROOM

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:35.074
Oh, no...

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:36.839
What's the matter, Toroko?

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:40.501
I can't find it...

00:07:41.047 --> 00:07:42.071
I'm telling you.

00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:45.743
I'm thinking of letting her compete
based on her glossy picture...

00:07:45.886 --> 00:07:48.184
...as this is
a glossy princess contest.

00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:50.883
Are you sure?

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:54.558
Don't complain until after you see
the swimming suit I picked.

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:55.854
Excuse me...

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.987
I can't find the swimming suit.

00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:03.025
No way!
We had it a few minutes ago.

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:06.801
I turned my bag inside out.

00:08:06.907 --> 00:08:08.704
No, we can't find it.

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:10.471
That means...

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.511
What are you going to do?

00:08:12.646 --> 00:08:15.342
Today is the last day
of the photo shoot.

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:17.713
Toroko's size is F.

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:20.649
We can't get
another one very quickly.

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:24.656
Don't say that you'll let them
photograph Tomo-chan nude...

00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.783
...just because we don't have
her swimming suit!

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.359
No way!

00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:38.833
Oh, shut up!
I'll take care of it!

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:40.338
MGPC 2nd INTERIM REPORT

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:43.642
See, I did take care of it...

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.538
Have we ever seen a photograph...

00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:49.581
...showing the beauty of a woman
so boldly and sensitively?

00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:50.672
No, never!

00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:52.877
This is a true glossy photograph...

00:08:52.986 --> 00:08:55.079
...which can represent
the 21st century.

00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:57.383
It's art!

00:08:57.524 --> 00:08:58.650
Don't you agree?!

00:08:58.758 --> 00:08:59.884
Right?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.353
But she is
at the bottom of the rankings...

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:05.921
We agreed
to take this photograph...

00:09:06.032 --> 00:09:07.727
...with "once-in-life-time" courage.

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:13.498
But it hasn't changed the result!
What are you going to do?!

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.103
Kids don't understand this art.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.643
What can I do?

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.077
But this is not good...

00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:23.672
If this continues, she'll be alone
at the bottom of the rankings...

00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:25.375
Don't jump
to that conclusion so quickly.

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:28.784
This kind of contest is based
on the number of postcard votes.

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:31.584
I have a secret weapon for that.

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:40.892
He gathered
the motorcycle gangs here.

00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:42.127
What is he thinking?

00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:46.805
Are you serious, Eikichi?

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:49.103
Of course I'm serious,
very serious.

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:50.836
With the name
of the biggest group...

00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:51.933
... in the Kanto area...

00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:54.036
...everyone has to write
at least one thousand postcards!

00:09:54.147 --> 00:09:55.671
Don't cheat!

00:09:56.282 --> 00:10:00.582
I can't believe he called us
together to write postcards.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.120
And what about the cost
for the postcards?

00:10:03.223 --> 00:10:06.989
It comes out of your pocket!
Eikichi won't pay for that!

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:11.055
What kind of secret weapon is this?!

00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.099
But block votes are
certainly the best method...

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.667
...for collecting votes.

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:18.831
Don't slow down!

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:22.437
MGPC 3rd INTERIM REPORT

00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:30.781
The sky is getting
more and more blue...

00:10:31.418 --> 00:10:33.613
You've got to be kidding me!

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.814
Fifty thousand! We wrote
at least fifty thousand postcards!

00:10:36.923 --> 00:10:38.720
Why did it increase
only by one thousand?

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:41.350
Maybe someone misspelled.

00:10:41.628 --> 00:10:44.529
Or the handwriting was so bad
that they couldn't read it...

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:47.465
Maybe the publisher found out
about the block votes...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.161
...and we got penalized!
That must be it!

00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:55.872
There is nothing that says
block votes are unacceptable.

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:59.043
Stop talking,
and you write more, too!

00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:00.112
It's strange...

00:11:01.448 --> 00:11:03.416
Before depositing them
in the mailbox...

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:04.983
... I checked all of the postcards.

00:11:05.785 --> 00:11:08.253
I didn't see any postcards
that might be invalid.

00:11:09.722 --> 00:11:12.350
Even if we got penalized
for some reason...

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:15.519
...they wouldn't impose a penalty
without contacting us.

00:11:15.628 --> 00:11:16.890
Then...

00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:21.055
Something fishy is going on
behind the scenes...

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.237
GREAT TOROKO OPPAI

00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:28.268
Who's the contestant in first place?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.173
First place... here it is!

00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.478
This is it. Megumi Hoshino.

00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:39.715
Oh, she belongs
to Warning Productions.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:41.411
Warning Productions?

00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:44.518
The biggest production company
in the industry.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.250
People say if you are
against Warning Productions...

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:48.826
...you can't survive in the industry.

00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:53.193
I see. Competing against someone
from Warning Productions...

00:11:53.298 --> 00:11:54.663
...our chance of winning is...

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:57.801
Why am I discouraging myself?!

00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:01.238
Tomoko Nomura is the best!
Tomo-chan is going to win!

00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:05.070
All right! If that's the case,
I'm going to write postcards!

00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:08.407
She was the one...

00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:10.504
...in the photo session
before Toroko, wasn't she?

00:12:10.616 --> 00:12:14.848
Before that, at the press conference,
Toroko knocked her down...

00:12:15.153 --> 00:12:16.381
I see...

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:22.252
Good, Tomoko Nomura.
She's running alone at the bottom.

00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:26.125
You embarrassed me...

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:29.729
... who belongs
to Warning Productions.

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:35.536
You should disappear
from the entertainment industry!

00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:41.438
What's the matter, Megu-chan?

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:42.808
This isn't like you.

00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:45.576
Don't worry about the contest.

00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:49.580
What are you talking about?
There's no way I'll worry about it.

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:51.519
Yes, I see.

00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:54.892
But just in case...

00:12:55.027 --> 00:12:56.824
TOMOKO NOMURA

00:12:56.928 --> 00:12:58.122
MEGUMI HOSHINO

00:12:58.397 --> 00:13:00.763
Eighty percent
of the part-time workers...

00:13:00.932 --> 00:13:03.025
...who are totaling the votes
are on our side...

00:13:03.135 --> 00:13:05.603
Your win is assured.

00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:07.397
Is that right?

00:13:08.073 --> 00:13:11.236
So I'm finally joining the stars...

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.044
There will be a presentation
ceremony of the MGPC...

00:13:22.154 --> 00:13:25.146
...here at Nippon Budokan
at four o'clock this evening.

00:13:25.257 --> 00:13:27.157
This event has produced...

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:28.783
...a number of famous people.

00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:30.759
We are going to find out...

00:13:30.862 --> 00:13:34.559
... who is going to join
the stars this year.

00:13:34.733 --> 00:13:37.668
Finally the day has come...

00:13:37.903 --> 00:13:40.531
Is she going to embarrass herself
in front of the whole country?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:43.267
I hope she isn't at the bottom.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.866
Why are you guys
losing confidence?

00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:50.146
Until the last report,
she's always been last.

00:13:50.248 --> 00:13:51.909
How can we have confidence?

00:13:52.017 --> 00:13:54.076
Winning is an impossible dream.

00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:58.078
We don't know the results yet,
winning or coming in last...

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.248
But...

00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:03.491
Trust me! A miracle will happen!

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:05.963
I've heard that before...

00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.198
Shut up!
Miracles happen all the time!

00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:11.693
Then they aren't miracles.

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:13.365
I believe it, too.

00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:18.103
Tomoko has enough talent.

00:14:19.077 --> 00:14:20.704
She can come from behind!

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:22.003
Hum...

00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:25.346
This is the first time
we agree on something.

00:14:27.719 --> 00:14:29.710
I wrote 230,000,000.

00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:31.652
I did 300,000,000.

00:14:32.023 --> 00:14:33.047
You did well.

00:14:33.258 --> 00:14:34.520
Because I'm her manager...

00:14:36.328 --> 00:14:38.125
I believe it, too.

00:14:38.997 --> 00:14:42.694
It is already a miracle
for me to be here...

00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:46.032
...and my photographs
were in the magazines.

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:49.436
If teacher says so,
a miracle will happen again!

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.303
Let's show them a miracle!

00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:54.673
Yes!

00:14:57.549 --> 00:14:59.449
TOMOKO

00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:01.178
TOMOKO

00:15:01.286 --> 00:15:04.653
HANGIN THERE, TOMOKO!

00:15:05.924 --> 00:15:07.755
Thank you for waiting.

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:10.089
Now we are going to have
the presentation ceremony...

00:15:10.195 --> 00:15:12.060
...for the Magazine
Glossy Princess Contest.

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.193
We are going
to announce the top five.

00:15:19.404 --> 00:15:24.364
In fifth place,
Kaori Ueda, 320, 057 votes!

00:15:25.243 --> 00:15:26.767
Kaori-chan!

00:15:30.615 --> 00:15:36.019
In fourth place,
Kyoko Sasaki, 356, 840 votes!

00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:42.523
In third place,
Miki Wakamatsu, 380, 123 votes!

00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:47.928
In second place,
Hiromi Tatsukawa, 437, 111 votes!

00:15:51.469 --> 00:15:54.233
And we're going to announce
the first place winner...

00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:01.468
... after showing all other
rankings on the board.

00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:05.513
Why are they making us wait?!

00:16:05.617 --> 00:16:07.983
Just tell us who's in first place.

00:16:18.697 --> 00:16:20.062
TOMOKO NOMURA

00:16:20.632 --> 00:16:22.395
As we thought...

00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:23.901
What?!

00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:25.492
No way!

00:16:29.608 --> 00:16:33.305
That means the winner
of the Magazine Glossy Princess is...

00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:38.180
...after receiving 1, 145, 231 votes...

00:16:39.885 --> 00:16:41.409
... Megumi Hoshino!

00:16:56.534 --> 00:16:58.764
Now we are going
to have the award ceremony.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.837
That's not right!

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:03.773
There is no way Tomo-chan
could get the fewest votes.

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:09.476
That's right! All my friends
voted for Tomo-chan!

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:15.450
Shut up! The award ceremony
is starting. Be quiet!

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.053
What did you say?

00:17:17.155 --> 00:17:18.144
What?!

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.054
Calm down, please calm down.

00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:24.992
The audience
in Budokan is protesting.

00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:27.627
I wonder what is happening.

00:17:27.832 --> 00:17:29.629
Tomo-chan!

00:17:29.868 --> 00:17:32.302
- Tomo-chan, Tomo-chan
- What should we do, Kibayashi-san?

00:17:32.737 --> 00:17:35.831
- Tomo-chan, Tomo-chan...
- Let's give out the trophy and end it.

00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:37.067
Roger!

00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:42.879
Before presenting the trophy,
let's have the winner...

00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:45.643
... Megumi Hoshino,
say a few words to her fans.

00:17:46.051 --> 00:17:47.075
Please.

00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:51.116
Everyone, thank you
very much for your votes.

00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:55.353
Because of you,
I'm now the Glossy Princess.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.586
Thank you very much!

00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:58.822
Shut up, mean girl!

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.761
The winner is Tomo-chan,
of course!

00:18:00.932 --> 00:18:03.127
Who do they think they are?!

00:18:03.835 --> 00:18:04.927
Teacher!

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:07.364
I've found out the trick.

00:18:08.573 --> 00:18:11.371
This! There are
a million postcards like this!

00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:14.908
This is the one I wrote...

00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:18.845
What does this mean?

00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:21.717
What a dirty trick!

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.356
I don't forgive them!

00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:29.517
I don't care if they are
the biggest production company!

00:18:30.161 --> 00:18:31.856
Teacher, Toroko is...

00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:36.756
Tomo-chan...

00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:48.744
Thank you...

00:18:49.814 --> 00:18:54.274
This is like a dream
that so many people support me.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.956
I was able to debut and compete...

00:18:59.157 --> 00:19:01.421
...in such a great contest
because you supported me.

00:19:01.526 --> 00:19:03.892
No matter what my ranking is...

00:19:04.629 --> 00:19:07.894
... I'm really touched.

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:11.797
So, everyone, please calm down.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.131
Thank you very much...

00:19:19.677 --> 00:19:22.009
Toroko received an invisible trophy.

00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:23.080
What?

00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:30.948
Then let's give the trophy...

00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:34.224
Megumi-chan! Megumi-chan!

00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:36.122
Everyone, thank you very...

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:38.587
...much.

00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:46.563
The event is not over yet.
Please don't leave your seats.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.579
We've got proof
that Warning Productions...

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.706
... leaked Toroko's address
and stole her swimming suit.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.341
But with Toroko's speech...

00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:03.148
It's a waste.

00:20:03.254 --> 00:20:05.950
That's all right! It was fun!

00:20:06.257 --> 00:20:07.952
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:08.226 --> 00:20:10.694
If Toroko says so...

00:20:10.795 --> 00:20:12.820
Even though a miracle
didn't happen...

00:20:13.832 --> 00:20:15.493
I wouldn't say that...

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.591
Well, the results already came out.

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:23.467
Kichijoji, Kichijoji.

00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:25.835
Thank you for riding.

00:20:29.314 --> 00:20:30.338
- This is...
- Platform No.3...

00:20:30.448 --> 00:20:32.075
- The doors are closing.
- What's that sound?

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.849
Please watch out.

00:20:49.167 --> 00:20:51.795
Right now,
big crowds are gathering...

00:20:51.903 --> 00:20:53.928
... around Tomoko Nomura's
home in Kichijoji.

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:55.764
Tomo-chan-fans...

00:20:55.874 --> 00:20:58.308
... Tomoko Nomura fans
are gathering here.

00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:00.969
Look at the number
of young people!

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:03.411
There are more here
than at Budokan.

00:21:04.482 --> 00:21:05.949
Tomo-chan!

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.348
Keep on going!
We're cheering for you!

00:21:17.195 --> 00:21:18.321
Teacher...!

00:21:26.804 --> 00:21:30.638
WARNING PRODUCTION'S
PUT-UP JOB DISCLOSED

00:21:30.842 --> 00:21:32.002
TORO-CHAN'S
BIG BREAKTHROUGH!!

00:21:48.052 --> 00:21:52.785
You can't love everyone

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.050
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.294 --> 00:22:00.196
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.364 --> 00:22:05.597
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:10.166
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.441 --> 00:22:14.377
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:22.518
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:22.787 --> 00:22:27.315
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.587
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.823
What is there for me to do?

00:22:37.068 --> 00:22:40.868
It may be small now

00:22:41.072 --> 00:22:45.031
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:48.871
A tear is about to drop

00:22:49.213 --> 00:22:53.149
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.417 --> 00:22:57.012
Live strong every moment

00:22:57.221 --> 00:23:03.160
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:16.641 --> 00:23:18.336
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:18.442 --> 00:23:19.409
Traitor!

00:23:19.944 --> 00:23:22.469
I guess you can't,
because you're a princess.

00:23:23.281 --> 00:23:24.475
Unbelievable!

00:23:25.283 --> 00:23:28.411
I hope this lasts long...

00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:32.652
I've got
some interesting information.

00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:38.618
Don't worry. Make him drink
until he can't remember anything.

00:23:39.697 --> 00:23:41.528
Hum... 1. 12 million yen...

00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:43.399
Did I lose it?!

00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:46.495
What?!
A secret school uniform bar?

00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:57.605
SEE YA NEXT TIME
