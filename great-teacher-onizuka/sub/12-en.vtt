WEBVTT

00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:21.228
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.137 --> 00:00:27.541
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.610
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:38.348
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:44.120
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:49.091
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:55.166
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.965
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.043
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:08.306
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:13.518
Toward the finish line

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:54.705
Oh, no, I'm gonna be late!

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:03.309
What am I gonna do?

00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:05.384
Hey, girl!

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.096
-Want a ride?
-Onizuka-sensei!

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.330
It's beautiful weather.
Shall we go all the way to the beach?

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.373
No! We'll be late in a minute!

00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.479
I know, I know!
We have plenty of time!

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:39.855
Weekly Duty

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:45.160
Safe!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.922
See? We made it.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.497
Thank you.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.859
That's Onizuka!

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:55.628
Wasn't it Fuyutsuki-sensei
riding on the back?

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:58.966
-Are you serious?
-How come they came together?

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.838
-He's helping her off!
-They make a cute couple.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.944
Mathematics II

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:10.985
It was awesome! I never knew
how good it feels to ride a bike.

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.681
You become one with the wind.
Maybe I should get a license.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.353
So, how far did you two go?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.194
You know, with Onizuka-sensei.

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.661
It's about time you felt
comfortable with teaching.

00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:33.774
I wouldn't be surprised if I heard
about you having a relationship.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:36.138
How far?

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.783
Onizuka-sensei and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

00:03:42.852 --> 00:03:46.379
It's so easy to see
through you, Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:51.552
If someone asks you "How far?,"
you should say, "Just to Shonan"...

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:54.821
...instead of worrying so much.

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:58.861
I'm not saying love affairs
are banned here...

00:03:59.102 --> 00:04:03.698
...but there are so many
gossipy people at our school.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.172
Japanese 2

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.470
I'm so sorry. I was looking away.

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:14.581
Oh, no. Me too. I didn't see you.

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:18.185
Are you all right, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:24.150
I'm just fine, really. I'm sorry.
I'm a scatterbrain.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.797
Teshigawara-sensei, wasn't it?
You're a math teacher.

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:36.597
I'm glad. You remembered me.

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:41.476
I still can't match a name
and a face in many cases.

00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:44.942
How are you doing?
Have you gotten used to our school?

00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.081
So-so. I'm still new...

00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:52.516
...and it's hard to grasp
what the students are thinking.

00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:59.153
I don't know why, but I haven't
been able to get much sleep lately.

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:04.355
I'm nervous all the time. I also feel
like someone is always watching me.

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.934
I understand. I was the same way
when I first started.

00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.698
What? Do you get nervous too,
Teshigawara-sensei?

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:17.312
You're cruel. I do get nervous too.

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.748
Of course. I'm sorry.

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:27.086
Let's do our best, both you and me,
as teachers.

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:39.397
Shit! Can't anything be done
about Mr. Onizuka?

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:42.867
Did you see him this morning?
That crappy bike!

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:45.631
He looked like
a member of a bike gang!

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:50.005
It's unbelievable that
he rode such a thing to school!

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:55.115
I can't believe there is a teacher
who would ride such a bike to school!

00:05:55.351 --> 00:06:01.517
Indeed. The way Onizuka interacts with
Miss Fuyutsuki seems a bit dangerous.

00:06:01.758 --> 00:06:03.191
Is that so?

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.158
I can tell just by looking
in her eyes. Between you and me...

00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:12.596
...there's a rumor that Onizuka was
seen coming out of her apartment.

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:15.429
-Sakurada-sensei!
-Yes.

00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:20.673
I don't think we should be gossiping
about the private life of a teacher.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.344
But, Mr. Teshigawara....

00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:34.948
I just don't want to lose a respectable
boss like you, Sakurada-sensei.

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:40.855
You're right.
You are absolutely right.

00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:48.698
I will not forgive anyone who
dirties Fuyutsuki's image...

00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:52.032
...because she is my--

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.446
Who left an adapter lying around here?

00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:03.811
It's my adapter.

00:07:04.053 --> 00:07:09.252
I'm so sorry. Did it erase
anything, Sashitukaigawara-sensei?

00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:10.516
Teshigawara

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.284
It's Teshigawara.

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:18.190
No big deal. I'm sure it was just
erotic graphics you downloaded.

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:21.899
I never downloaded such a thing!

00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:29.302
Don't be so stiff. If you want,
I'll print a really amazing one.

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:34.005
I downloaded it from a foreign site,
Chosigawara-sensei!

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.615
Teshigawara

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:37.479
It's Teshigawara.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.019
I hate a person who graduated
from a third-rate college...

00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:44.090
...is not ashamed of it
and is thick-skinned.

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:48.229
In this day and age, we should
be grateful we're not starving.

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:52.400
There are many who graduated from
Tokyo University who have no job.

00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:55.269
If you think about it, we're lucky.

00:07:55.505 --> 00:08:01.034
We get paid each month and we get
a free lunch at school. Right?

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.613
Sashigawara-sensei?

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:10.474
Did I say something to offend him?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.516
Ota

00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:13.779
Society of the Study
of Victimization in Education

00:08:14.023 --> 00:08:16.719
Why is he working
in the same school as I am?

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:21.293
I'm a Tokyo University graduate,
and he's from a third-rate college.

00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:24.398
It makes me puke to think
we're breathing the same air!

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:25.601
Mathematics I

00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:27.335
Teacher?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.231
Teacher!

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:33.205
Oh, sorry. I was daydreaming.

00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:36.935
You must get tired from
working part-time as a tutor.

00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:39.438
I'm all right.

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:42.776
Hold on a second.
I'll ask for some tea for you.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.478
Let's take a break.

00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:53.688
Calm down.
Calm down, Suguru Teshigawara.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.195
When I get home,
Arcadia will be waiting for me.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.664
That's right. When I open the door....

00:09:15.184 --> 00:09:16.344
I'm home.

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:48.513
Oh, Azusa, have you
lost weight recently?

00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:53.549
What? You're mean, Misako!

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.388
A girlfriend from college again.
Good buddies, huh?

00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:00.357
Bargain? No, thanks.

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:04.692
I can't wear brand-name outfits,
because I'm a teacher.

00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:07.968
That's right.
If you don't like brand names...

00:10:08.204 --> 00:10:12.573
...you can wear a simple white blouse.
It'd look great on you.

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:18.406
Besides, I want a personal computer.
IMac? Yeah, that's it!

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:25.920
I can feel the adrenaline rushing
through my blood just listening to you.

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:30.683
This is my Arcadia, my perfect world.

00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:34.829
Hold on. There's a call coming in.
Hello? Onizuka-sensei!

00:10:36.098 --> 00:10:38.862
Come on, Onizuka-sensei!

00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:48.534
Just wait, Azusa.
I promise I will protect you!

00:11:00.862 --> 00:11:02.762
Good morning.

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:07.231
Teshigawara-sensei!
Do you use the Inogashira Line?

00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:09.437
Yes. I live in Kugayama.

00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:13.072
Me too. What a coincidence!
I had no idea.

00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:18.905
I'm always taking the latest possible
train. That's why I didn't know.

00:11:19.147 --> 00:11:20.512
You're going in early today?

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:24.017
I wanted to finish typing
my handouts at school.

00:11:24.252 --> 00:11:28.211
You should have finished it at home.
Don't you have a computer?

00:11:28.456 --> 00:11:32.290
No, I don't. I think
it would be convenient if I did.

00:11:33.028 --> 00:11:36.327
Would you let me give you one?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.999
I'll teach you how to use it too.
Why don't you come visit me?

00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:46.765
I'll come, if it's for a PC!
When would be good?

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:53.004
Let's see.... Tomorrow I need to make
handouts for class and the day after.

00:11:53.248 --> 00:11:56.342
What about tonight?

00:11:57.352 --> 00:12:00.287
Yes, with pleasure! I'm so happy.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:03.548
Now it won't be as troublesome
as it's been.

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:09.059
And if I get a home computer,
it means I can surf the Net too.

00:12:09.297 --> 00:12:13.256
I'm going to send lots of e-mail!

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.971
Good morning.

00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:22.735
You're not with Onizuka-sensei today?

00:12:22.977 --> 00:12:25.969
Fuyutsuki-sensei,
are you dating two guys?

00:12:26.214 --> 00:12:30.150
-No, that's not what it is.
-You shouldn't tease your teachers.

00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:32.952
Double-dater!

00:12:33.188 --> 00:12:36.180
Fuyutsuki-sensei, don't pay attention.

00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:39.587
-You're right.
-Now, let's go.

00:12:40.128 --> 00:12:45.361
Fuyutsuki-sensei, good morning.

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:51.532
What are you doing?

00:12:52.807 --> 00:12:54.968
Onizuka-sensei!

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.241
Oh, shit!

00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:00.044
Onizuka-sensei!

00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:03.079
- Wait, Onizuka-sensei!
- Onizuka-sensei?

00:13:04.152 --> 00:13:07.588
Are you listening?
It belongs to the school!

00:13:07.822 --> 00:13:12.589
It's not a costume!
Are you listening, Onizuka-sensei?
Wait!

00:13:12.827 --> 00:13:16.957
Onizuka-kun? Idiot!

00:13:17.332 --> 00:13:22.861
Keep on acting silly, Onizuka.
Very soon my world will become perfect.

00:13:23.104 --> 00:13:26.471
I won't allow anyone to interrupt.
Azusa is mine!

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:36.346
Well done.

00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:40.649
I'm having an adrenaline rush.

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:45.656
If it continues, my blood pressure
will record an all-time high!

00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:50.591
It's gonna be
my happiest night tonight.

00:13:57.405 --> 00:13:58.497
Welcome.

00:13:59.841 --> 00:14:02.503
Nice room. Neat and clean too.

00:14:02.744 --> 00:14:05.645
The walls and furniture
are coordinated in white.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.748
-Have a seat. I'll make you tea.
-I'll do it.

00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:15.422
Don't worry. You're a guest.
By the way, that's the one.

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:21.751
Is this it? Laptops are so small.

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:23.987
What's this string?

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:28.334
-Would you like to pull it?
-Is it O.K.?

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.336
I prepared it for you.

00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:35.799
For me?

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:40.906
Don't be afraid. Be courageous.

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.054
What is this?

00:14:53.294 --> 00:14:57.321
I've been watching you all along.
This is the proof.

00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:58.998
Teshigawara-sensei!

00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:04.536
I'm always watching over you.
I'll never let you go.

00:15:04.772 --> 00:15:06.569
Sensei.

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:15.545
Natural Spring Water

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:21.016
But I know that reality is
not as sweet as fantasy.

00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:26.216
If she saw her own photos here,
she'll probably run away barefoot.

00:15:26.461 --> 00:15:29.760
If she finds out that
I can look into her room...

00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:32.125
... I'll be labeled a stalker...

00:15:32.367 --> 00:15:38.499
...and lose my status and everything
I've worked for. I'm not that dumb!

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.834
I'll spend time with Azusa
in front of the string.

00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:46.479
There is a fine line between
pleasure and self-destruction.

00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:53.119
It's almost like walking in a trench
coat without wearing anything under it!

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:59.423
Ah, beta-endorphins!

00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.026
Here she comes!

00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:11.199
Welcome!

00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:14.707
Howdy.

00:16:19.047 --> 00:16:22.983
Hey, Teshigawara-sensei. What happened?
Please open the door!

00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:26.448
Why is that guy here?
It's not part of my plan.

00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:29.782
It was not part
of my data for analysis!

00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:33.983
Could he have detected my plan
with an animal-like intuition...

00:16:34.228 --> 00:16:37.061
...and he's trying to interrupt?

00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:42.760
What are you doing?
How did you unlock the door?

00:16:43.004 --> 00:16:47.498
How? With a wire because
you wouldn't let me in.

00:16:47.742 --> 00:16:50.905
If someone locks you out,
you force yourself in?

00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:54.308
Go home.
I'm expecting an important guest.

00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:57.746
If you're waiting for Fuyutsuki-chan,
she's not coming.

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:03.189
Her student was caught shoplifting,
so she left school in a hurry.

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.387
She's not coming.
My Azusa is not coming?

00:17:06.628 --> 00:17:11.691
So I was asked to come for her.
Is this it? The personal computer?

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:14.993
No! That's the brand-new G3/400!

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:20.105
Hey, who said you could come in?
Don't just pull out the USB cables!

00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:24.807
What is this string?

00:17:26.147 --> 00:17:30.083
I see. It must be a present
for Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.845
When pulled, would a confetti ball
break open? What an idea!

00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:35.180
Don't touch!

00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:38.688
It won't ruin the effect or anything.

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:42.828
Just go!
You are just unbelievable! Here!

00:17:43.064 --> 00:17:47.831
This is the laptop I was going
to give to her. Just take it and go!

00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:51.869
You won't let me pull the string?
I can't get it out of my mind.

00:17:52.106 --> 00:17:58.170
Don't worry! Go home, please! Just
looking at your face irritates me!

00:17:58.413 --> 00:18:02.474
I see. You'll be happy when I leave.
Then I'll leave.

00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:06.016
-But I can't get it out of my mind.
-Just go. Hurry!

00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:10.918
I can't get it out of....
There! I got it!

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:15.289
Stop it! Please, I beg of you!

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.862
-I understand.
-Oh, you understand!

00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:22.627
If you keep insisting,
I'll want to see it even more!

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.996
What?

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:25.466
Get ready!

00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:29.006
Stop it!

00:18:31.112 --> 00:18:34.775
Don't pull it! Don't pull it!
Don't pull it!

00:18:43.224 --> 00:18:48.628
Please, calm down, Teshigawara-sensei!
It was a joke. A joke!

00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:51.593
Shut up!

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.511
Teshigawara-sensei, are you all right?

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:15.848
Get out!

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:20.493
You should go to a hospital.
Or shall I call for an ambulance?

00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:25.062
If you don't get out,
I will kill you for sure this time.

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.267
Get out!

00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:35.169
If you don't get out soon....

00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:38.775
See you!

00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:51.152
Onizuka, you're just
a third-rate college graduate...

00:19:51.392 --> 00:19:54.259
...and you teased me,
a Tokyo University graduate!

00:19:54.495 --> 00:19:58.761
I'll never forgive you!
You'll see what I can do.

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:05.131
I will use my connections and make sure
you don't go anywhere near my Azusa!

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:10.672
Is that so? If it's true,
it is a serious problem.

00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:14.514
Of course I trust you, Teshigawara-sensei.
I'll look into it.

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:18.583
And I'll bring it up
in the organization I sponsor...

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.816
...the Society of the Study
of Victimization in Education.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:28.517
I will not tolerate
a juvenile-delinquent teacher teaching.

00:20:29.397 --> 00:20:30.921
Please help me out.

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:35.397
We are just teachers and we have
no say in teacher discipline.

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:41.304
So I'd appreciate it if someone
like you, Ohta-san, could take over.

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:47.276
No problem. You're always taking such
good care of our daughter, Hidemi.

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:53.848
Certainly. I don't know
how much the principal favors him.

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:58.525
We will definitely impeach him
and justice will be served.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.723
What did the teacher say?

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:06.093
Teshigawara-sensei said he wanted
to discuss something about school.

00:21:06.334 --> 00:21:07.392
Really?

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:10.433
Go to bed.
You have an early morning, don't you?

00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:12.696
Yes.

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:28.411
Onizuka, as long as he is there,
my world will not become perfect!

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.351
I need to eliminate him!

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:45.968
You and me, let's go away

00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:51.201
To look for new emotions today

00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:56.247
Together we can overcome

00:21:56.518 --> 00:22:02.184
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:22:02.457 --> 00:22:06.587
Open your eyes and open the door

00:22:07.396 --> 00:22:11.799
The world in front of your eyes

00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:17.402
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:22:17.806 --> 00:22:22.004
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:32.812
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:42.820
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:47.229
I want to see you, but I can't

00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:52.303
So I just embrace my love

00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:57.409
Even walking on a crowded street

00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:03.982
Your smile makes my head spin

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.593
Next Episode

00:23:16.832 --> 00:23:20.165
Wonderful. Azusa is coming
to cook dinner for me!

00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:26.997
Take care of yourself,
because you are mine.

00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:29.537
It's a punishment. Lick it!
