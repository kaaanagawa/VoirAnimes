WEBVTT

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.668
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:27.980
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.050
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.787
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:44.560
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:49.531
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:55.606
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.404
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.507
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:08.745
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:13.958
Toward the finish line

00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:47.502
It was my mistake to
ask someone like you.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.392
Miyabi-chan, wait! Miyabi-chan!

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.329
Never talk to me again!

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:19.842
I'm through with you!

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.330
-I'm sorry, Miyabi.
-An audition?

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.336
Right. I sent your photo
to a Beautiful Girl Idol Contest.

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:51.802
What is that?

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:57.002
You're pretty, and I thought
you would definitely be selected!

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.747
-Without my permission?
-That's why I said I was sorry.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:04.978
But, Miyabi, you might get selected.

00:03:05.222 --> 00:03:09.022
You're really good-looking.
You also sing pretty well.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.524
Why don't you just show up?

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:13.821
I'm not interested.

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:17.727
Soon you'll receive the results
of the initial paper review.

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:20.563
If selected,
you enter the final selection!

00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:21.930
Yeah, right.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:25.505
Listen, Miyabi.
We can enter together.

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:30.842
Together?
Chikako, did you enter yourself too?

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:33.345
I felt lonely doing it by myself.

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:36.785
I see. You wanted to enter.

00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:40.149
Awesome!

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:43.087
Miyabi-chan, you're gonna be an idol!

00:03:46.864 --> 00:03:48.491
Good morning.

00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:53.464
Miyabi, wait!

00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:55.569
Hey, Miyabi!

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:01.868
Miyabi-chan.

00:04:03.714 --> 00:04:05.978
Oni

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.676
Good morning.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:14.153
What are you doing?

00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:16.552
I'm just a nameless ninja.

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:20.093
A commoner like you should not
fall in love with me.

00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:22.026
Now, excuse me.

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:54.329
-Wouldn't you notice?
-She's truly toroko, slow girl.

00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.672
What happened? Nomura used
to belong to Aizawa's group.

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:07.676
What in the world is Aizawa doing?

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:11.403
I thought her only enemy
was Onizuka, wasn't it?

00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:19.316
All rise!

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:22.789
Bow.

00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.793
Be seated.

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:38.134
-What's wrong, Nomura-san?
-Nothing.

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.470
But this....

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:46.308
She dropped it herself.
On top of that, she sat on it.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:50.249
She can't help it.
She is really slow.

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:55.617
Is that true?

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:01.157
Ice cream?

00:06:01.398 --> 00:06:02.922
Yes.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:07.399
Ice cream, huh? That's strange.

00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:10.598
I didn't know
they sold ice cream here.

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:14.140
That's not the point!

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:20.980
I didn't want to stick my nose into
the affairs of a class that's not mine.

00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:24.153
But that is definitely bullying.

00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:26.515
Is that so?

00:06:27.357 --> 00:06:31.259
If that's the case,
something needs to be done.

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:32.928
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:37.395
Excuse me, are you thinking seriously?

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:42.099
That's not it!

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:46.037
Despotic Government
Citizens Revolution

00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:51.373
After the people's revolution, to
replace the autocracy of the king...

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:53.708
He's not as motivated as usual.

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:56.010
...they pursued the realization...

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:59.017
And he says he's committed
to being a teacher.

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:02.817
I'm too shocked to speak.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.723
...of a democratic government....

00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:09.455
What was I saying?

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:17.930
Hit it there!

00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:24.078
It's hard to make it to the trash can.

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:34.481
Nomura, what are you doing facing
a strange direction all by yourself?

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:39.685
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's my fault.

00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:44.625
She's the trash can of this class.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.505
What is it? What did I do?

00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:05.181
No more, no more!
I'm too sleepy to teach a class!

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:07.822
Let's do a soda bottle rocket!

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:10.756
Again? You think it's fun.

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:14.430
Yeah. It's pretty fun, isn't it?
Let's do it.

00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:17.190
It's better than
Onizuka's regular class.

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:20.399
If you're not teaching, I'm leaving.

00:08:20.637 --> 00:08:25.336
Do what you like. Murai, go get
a soda bottle from the student store.

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.908
Shoot! Why do I have to?

00:08:29.146 --> 00:08:31.341
Miyabi-chan, me too.

00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:34.608
Don't come with me, you trash can.

00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:38.718
You make me sick!

00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:45.052
Let's go. If he is a teacher,
he should teach decent classes.

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:59.230
That's right.
That's how you put air into it.

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.570
-Am I doing it right?
-You're doing a good job!

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:07.512
-Hey, is it safe to let Toroko do it?
-What do you mean?

00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:10.285
She is seriously slow.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.616
When the girls perform, her
performance looks like an O-Bon dance.

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:18.521
When she makes scrambled eggs,
she turns them into pancakes.

00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:20.957
It takes her a minute
to run 100 meters.

00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:23.826
Whatever she does,
she does it so poorly.

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:30.597
It's our unspoken rule not to let
Toroko do anything to avoid mishaps.

00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:36.205
Don't worry. It makes no difference
if you're slow to fill up the air.

00:09:36.446 --> 00:09:39.040
Right, Nomura? Are you done?

00:09:48.992 --> 00:09:52.621
Shit! That's why I told him
not to let Toroko do it!

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:57.630
It's cold! I'm soaking wet
all the way to my underwear!

00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:03.802
I'm home. Daddy has just come home!

00:10:04.374 --> 00:10:07.741
Darling, welcome home.
You came home very early today.

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:11.437
The head of our section was away
on a business trip.

00:10:11.682 --> 00:10:15.812
I was looking forward to your return.
Do you want to eat first?

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:20.649
Let me think.... Let's eat first.
What's for dinner today?

00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:23.118
Your favorite, hamburger steak!

00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:25.427
Oh, great!

00:10:25.662 --> 00:10:28.062
Here, hamburger steak. And beer.

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:31.563
You think of everything.

00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:03.022
Tasty. What a feast.

00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:07.026
This is so good.

00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:16.408
Here, darling, try the potatoes too.

00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:29.291
Hey, you wench.
Your first son, Kenji, is home!

00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:31.758
Money. Give me money.

00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:36.723
You got your paycheck, didn't you?

00:11:41.104 --> 00:11:43.868
Hey, Nomura, what are you waiting for?

00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:47.270
Your problem child, Kenji,
has come home.

00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:52.039
Unless you do something soon,
your home will be all messed up.

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:55.918
Hey, stop it, Kenji!

00:11:56.153 --> 00:12:02.058
Shut up, you bitch. Stop me
from running wild, if you can.

00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:06.752
As a mother-- No, as a person,
I will see that you get rehabilitated!

00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:08.897
Yeah, right! Let's see.

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:14.399
-Hurry up and get off the bike.
-Shut up and give me money!

00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:19.735
Do you think we are rich or something?
I have no money to give you!

00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:34.828
How do you like this?
This is Miss Juliana.

00:12:35.065 --> 00:12:37.625
Teacher, you're amazing!

00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:42.927
I used to dream about hanging out
with these kinds of girls.

00:12:43.173 --> 00:12:48.770
Nomura, don't you have dreams like
that? Dreams of something you want.

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:55.649
You've gotta have something. Brand-
name items, a camera or cell phone?

00:12:59.723 --> 00:13:01.281
Nothing in particular.

00:13:01.524 --> 00:13:05.927
Nothing? Don't you have at least one?

00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:12.892
Oh, come on.
Just come up with something!

00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:18.641
Then a cell phone.

00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:25.044
Well, a friend I can talk about
anything with on a cell phone.

00:13:25.749 --> 00:13:28.980
-Maybe....
-Like this one?

00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:32.347
Friend

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:35.956
Oh, no! I don't like it!
Make it look more human.

00:13:36.192 --> 00:13:37.887
Then from the Roswell case.

00:13:38.128 --> 00:13:39.857
Friend

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.057
That's a dead body!

00:13:44.634 --> 00:13:49.503
-An alien captured by the FBI.
-How come they are all aliens?

00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:53.505
-You don't like it?
-No, I don't.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.379
Chinese Food
Ramen Gyoza

00:13:57.614 --> 00:14:00.447
Miso ramen, gyoza, beer
and a half bowl of rice.

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:05.177
One miso, one gyoza, one beer
and half a bowl of rice.

00:14:05.722 --> 00:14:10.489
You took your time to come here.
I'm sorry I can't visit with you much.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.361
Oh, please don't worry.
I just stopped by.

00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:17.559
-Fried rice is ready.
-All right.

00:14:18.268 --> 00:14:22.136
How's Tomoko doing at school?
She isn't giving you trouble?

00:14:22.372 --> 00:14:24.602
The girl is slow, isn't she?

00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:29.244
-No, no trouble at all.
-Is that so? That's good to know.

00:14:29.746 --> 00:14:31.213
Here it is.

00:14:32.015 --> 00:14:35.644
We have nothing fancy,
but we have plenty of noodles.

00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:39.821
-You want some, don't you?
-Thank you! Good timing. I was hungry.

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:44.755
Tomoko, hurry up and eat.
I want you to help out here.

00:14:44.994 --> 00:14:46.894
This is really tasty, sir!

00:14:47.463 --> 00:14:52.093
You're such a nice teacher.
I'll treat you to beer and egg too.

00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:54.565
What? Thank you!

00:14:56.172 --> 00:14:58.538
Now a mini ramen is ready.

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:04.770
Hey, Tomoko. Take two glasses
of ice water to number 3.

00:15:05.315 --> 00:15:07.442
-Hurry!
-Okay.

00:15:07.684 --> 00:15:09.515
Restroom
Suntory Draft Beer

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:14.689
Everyone else in our family is quick.
I wonder who she takes after.

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.851
I'm so sorry about today.

00:15:18.094 --> 00:15:23.691
You took time to come to my house,
but I'm always this way.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:28.393
When I was little, I'd follow a
stranger because he offered me candy.

00:15:28.638 --> 00:15:32.574
Or I'd cause trouble whenever
I tried to help in the restaurant.

00:15:33.142 --> 00:15:36.839
I was always yelled at
by my father and mother.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.982
Isn't it strange that
I'm the only slow one in the family?

00:15:41.184 --> 00:15:45.587
In elementary school I was always
the last in sports and studies.

00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:49.781
I was called a cow
because my breasts were big.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.653
Teacher, what are you doing?

00:15:53.096 --> 00:15:57.829
What? I was just....
Since they are so big....

00:16:05.408 --> 00:16:06.773
Is that yours?

00:16:08.544 --> 00:16:13.208
Yes. I just couldn't put it away.
So I've kept it here.

00:16:17.553 --> 00:16:23.116
When I was in 4th grade, Miyabi invited
me to her home. It made me so happy.

00:16:23.693 --> 00:16:28.562
You know, Miyabi-chan is pretty,
smart and very athletic.

00:16:29.032 --> 00:16:31.865
Her father is president of a company.

00:16:32.101 --> 00:16:38.404
My heart was beating so fast because
such a person was coming home with me.

00:16:38.741 --> 00:16:40.732
Miyabi is really awesome.

00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:47.646
I have longed to be like her
for a long, long time...

00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:53.550
...because she has a lot
of things I don't have.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:17:00.127
But it doesn't matter anymore. It
looks like she got disgusted with me.

00:17:02.732 --> 00:17:09.137
I can't blame her because, look at me.
I don't think I'm worth living.

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:18.943
Chinese Food

00:17:19.716 --> 00:17:22.480
Teacher, please hang out with me,
could you?

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.655
Nomura, why don't you have
more confidence in yourself?

00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:32.491
I understand that
you long to be like Aizawa...

00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:35.721
...because she has
a lot of things you don't.

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:41.028
But I think you have a lot of things
she doesn't have.

00:17:41.738 --> 00:17:46.732
Why don't you pretend that you were
cheated and bet your life on me?

00:17:50.013 --> 00:17:53.642
-What is that?
-Maybe there's some sort of event.

00:17:53.883 --> 00:17:56.579
Hi. Would you like
to have tea with me?

00:17:56.819 --> 00:18:00.915
Hey, girl? Don't you wanna work
at our club? It's an Ime-kura.

00:18:01.157 --> 00:18:03.751
No, thank you.

00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:11.029
Onizuka-sensei, I wonder
what he had in mind.

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:12.427
Digital Photos

00:18:12.668 --> 00:18:17.935
Tomorrow, wait for me in that outfit.
I'll produce you.

00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:23.278
Produce? What is that?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.575
Director of Talent Scouting
Honey Otsuka

00:18:26.816 --> 00:18:29.080
-Are you Tomoko Nomura?
-Yes.

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:32.048
I am a producer of adult videos.

00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:36.522
Producer? Adult videos?

00:18:37.193 --> 00:18:42.790
I want you to come with me. You've
heard it from Eikichi, didn't you?

00:18:43.032 --> 00:18:47.969
I see. This is what he meant when
he said he was going to produce me.

00:18:48.204 --> 00:18:50.729
Miss Inogashira Pageant
Open to the Public

00:18:50.973 --> 00:18:53.942
Will Miyabi show up?
She wasn't really into it.

00:18:54.177 --> 00:18:55.701
Musashino Public Hall

00:18:55.945 --> 00:18:58.140
She'll show up.
She's full of confidence.

00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:04.877
True. She's on a different level
from someone like you who didn't pass.

00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:08.113
There she is. Miyabi, this way!

00:19:11.094 --> 00:19:12.652
Hey, future idol!

00:19:12.895 --> 00:19:15.955
Don't be silly.
I'm only doing this to kill time.

00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:19.293
I don't intend
to take Onizuka's class.

00:19:21.437 --> 00:19:24.201
Aizawa, what are you doing here?

00:19:24.807 --> 00:19:26.672
What are you guys doing?

00:19:27.176 --> 00:19:28.609
What happened was....

00:19:32.048 --> 00:19:35.347
Could you stay still a little while?

00:19:36.152 --> 00:19:40.555
Ah, very good. Very good.
Makeup looks good on your face.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.554
Hard to believe
you're a junior-high student.

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:46.227
Am I being taken somewhere?

00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:51.195
It's okay. Don't worry.
We're not some weirdos.

00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:56.661
We're just regular citizens
who were asked to bring you here.

00:19:57.106 --> 00:20:01.133
Could you wear that outfit over there?

00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:06.444
My gut feeling is that
you will look better in that outfit...

00:20:06.682 --> 00:20:09.082
...rather than a Cos-Play outfit.

00:20:09.986 --> 00:20:14.514
Middle-aged men like a girl
with a Lolita face and huge breasts.

00:20:15.525 --> 00:20:19.985
What am I gonna do? I came with them,
but it's probably X-rated work.

00:20:20.229 --> 00:20:23.824
"Affair With A Housewife"
"Obscene High School" "Fallen Angels"

00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:28.696
They'll probably strip me naked
and make embarrassing videos of me.

00:20:30.706 --> 00:20:36.702
But I guess it can't be helped.
I'm slow and stupid.

00:20:36.946 --> 00:20:42.384
Teacher is trying to tell me that
I could survive in this kind of world.

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:46.577
Teacher was saying
my breasts were big.

00:20:46.822 --> 00:20:50.155
I have no choice
but to go with the flow.

00:20:50.393 --> 00:20:54.124
I feel like a calf
in the "Donna, Donna" song.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.288
That's right. I'm a cow.

00:20:58.534 --> 00:21:02.436
I'm a cow that produces a lot of milk.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.210
"Field trip today.

00:21:13.449 --> 00:21:17.180
Come to Musashino Public Hall
immediately. Onizuka."

00:21:19.455 --> 00:21:22.618
Okay. Do we have everyone?

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:29.259
Good morning, everyone.
Isn't it a perfect day for a field trip?

00:21:29.765 --> 00:21:32.529
-Field trip?
-That's right.

00:21:32.768 --> 00:21:37.831
I call it "Secrets of the Entertainment
Industry, How a Star Is Born."

00:21:38.074 --> 00:21:43.535
The purpose is to witness the moment
when a star is born in real time.

00:21:46.782 --> 00:21:48.807
Hey, Eikichi-chan!

00:21:49.051 --> 00:21:51.383
This way, this way.

00:21:51.687 --> 00:21:56.124
Sorry we're late. We had to stop
at a traffic checkpoint on the way.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:58.993
So how is it? How did it go?

00:21:59.228 --> 00:22:02.629
It's a little different
from your original request.

00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:05.562
It's perfected with my own taste.

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:10.672
This is better for middle-aged men
than the Cos-Play option. Here.

00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:16.442
Now we have the main character.

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:19.147
What? Teacher?

00:22:20.216 --> 00:22:22.844
Everyone. Miyabi-chan!

00:22:23.352 --> 00:22:26.913
Toroko! What kind of outfit
are you wearing?

00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:31.286
Well, we have everyone, right?
Let's go inside.

00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:36.328
Wait a minute! Don't tell me
the girl who's becoming a star is....

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:40.695
Of course it's Nomura.
Tomoko Nomura!

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:48.300
Me?

00:22:50.313 --> 00:22:52.304
That's right.

00:23:00.022 --> 00:23:04.288
Nomura, just be your usual self.

00:23:04.527 --> 00:23:06.495
Okay. Let's go inside.

00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:11.063
Teacher, I heard that Aizawa is
in the audition today too.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.567
Oh, really? What a coincidence!
Then she will be Nomura's rival.

00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:23.207
Fuji TV presents the audition
for Miss Inogashira...

00:23:23.446 --> 00:23:26.415
...the image girl for Inogashira Park.

00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:31.018
Miss Inogashira Pageant/Open Audition
Sponsored by Fuji Television

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.214
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.488 --> 00:23:51.448
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.693 --> 00:23:56.494
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.765 --> 00:24:02.431
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.704 --> 00:24:06.834
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:12.046
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.848 --> 00:24:17.649
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:18.053 --> 00:24:22.251
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:33.059
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:43.067
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:43.278 --> 00:24:47.476
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.749 --> 00:24:52.550
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.854 --> 00:24:57.655
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.926 --> 00:25:04.229
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:15.143 --> 00:25:16.371
Next Episode

00:25:16.578 --> 00:25:18.603
Miyabi doesn't talk to me anymore.

00:25:18.847 --> 00:25:22.510
Talk to her one more time
from the stage.

00:25:24.553 --> 00:25:27.579
You're right. You will win.

00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:32.387
Don't come near me, you trash can!

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:41.235
You just don't understand
how slow she is.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:46.271
A miracle will happen
if my judgment was correct.
