00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.243
A student attacked a member
of the Board of Education.

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:44.719
It's unheard of...

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:47.195
Really, kids are unpredictable...

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:48.704
...these days...

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:51.401
What is the school doing?

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:57.042
Did that girl really say
she stabbed Saito?

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.612
There is no other way
of looking at it...

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:01.917
I'm not asking for your opinion.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:05.420
I'm asking you if the girl
herself really said so.

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:08.886
No... She didn't say so...

00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.253
...but when I asked her,
she didn't deny it.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.460
Is there a problem?

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.171
If Saito were to find out...

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.901
...about Mizuki Yokoyama's suicide...

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:18.739
...what do you think he would do?

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.111
How is his condition?

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.282
The doctor says he is
in critical condition.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.825
I feel bad for him,
but it is a break for us.

00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:33.167
Yes. Unless he speaks up...

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:35.768
...the connection between
Mizuki Yokoyama's suicide and us...

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:37.597
...will not be revealed...

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.372
This incident will finally
be put to rest.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:42.307
Ah, then, everyone.

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:45.084
Regarding
Onizuka's Eikichi dismissal...

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.847
...and Miyabi Aizawa's
surrender to the police...

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:49.288
...we're going to hand
in our votes. All right?

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:51.485
Vice Principal, please wait.

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:52.629
What is it?

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.625
I don't know how much authority
the Board of Education has...

00:02:56.902 --> 00:02:59.064
...but these one-sided
demands are unreasonable!

00:02:59.474 --> 00:03:01.032
But, Fuyutsuki-sensei...

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.340
...what Aizawa did was
undoubtedly a case of assault.

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:07.246
We don't know
if she really stabbed him!

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:09.885
After all, we've heard
Kikuchi and the others' stories.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.921
And we're still obeying
the Board's orders? It's wrong!

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.660
But Yokoyama's
pregnancy is just a rumor.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.188
We have no hard evidence...

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:21.096
...and yet the school runs
the risk of being shut down.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.467
There are many other schools.

00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:26.337
If you're only
thinking about yourself...

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.411
...you're no different
from the idiots on the Board.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.175
You are so rude!

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:33.183
I am thinking about this school!

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.486
Then why don't you fight
against the Board of Education?!

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:37.016
That is...

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:39.221
Principal!

00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.665
If we continue arguing like this,
we will make little progress.

00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:42.792
Please cast your votes!

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:46.732
Principal!

00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:50.438
We won't vote yet.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:51.938
What?!

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.452
- What did you say?! No way!
- This isn't what I was told!

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:58.857
I believe the students' story
and Onizuka-sensei.

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:00.452
Principal!

00:04:01.298 --> 00:04:03.494
If we settle the matter now...

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:05.729
...only to save the school...

00:04:06.472 --> 00:04:07.804
...the problems which are
rampant in the school...

00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:08.874
...won't go away.

00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:11.435
They will actually get worse.

00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:14.106
But, Principal, if we do nothing...

00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:15.184
Vice Principal.

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:19.414
This term may be
out-of-date nowadays...

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.859
...but we are...

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.087
...Seishokusha (professionals
in the sacred vocation).

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.064
Seishokusha?

00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:25.929
Generations
might have changed.

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:27.899
The way of education
might have changed.

00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:30.632
But this thing should
never be shaken...

00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:33.103
...even if we need to hold on
with our last ounce of strength.

00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:34.946
We have to stand firm...

00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.743
...as professionals
in this sacred vocation.

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:40.580
Onizuka-sensei!

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:41.917
The Principal is on your side!

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:43.718
Onizuka...

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:45.788
What's this?

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:54.707
Excuse me..!

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.409
I'm just a show biz agent...

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.405
How could I do such a thing?!

00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:02.377
- Just spread the word...
- Good morning!

00:05:02.488 --> 00:05:03.455
-...that it's a scoop. That's all!
- Good morning!

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.252
- We'll do the rest.
- It smells like tobacco again.

00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:06.326
- But...
- You have to get some air...

00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:07.394
- This is the last time...
-...in here. It isn't good for you...

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:09.130
...I'll bother you. Please.

00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.994
Tomoko, that window is..!

00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:12.962
- What are you going to do?
- What's with this wind?!

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:14.297
- Never mind.
- It's too windy.

00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.373
- I'm counting on you.
- Close it now!

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.138
I'm sorry!

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.610
That's all right. It only needs
to be cleaned up...

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:23.382
It will take the whole day, won't it?

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:24.645
Oh, I'll help you.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.947
Never mind!

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.820
Just do your job.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.863
- I screwed up again!
- Hello.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.360
Hey, can you really do that?!

00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:38.029
Security's tight...

00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:39.565
Of course.

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:41.041
Getting into the database
of the hospital...

00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:44.274
...and reading the death
certificate won't be easy...

00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:46.048
But there is no other way.

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:48.415
We don't have evidence...

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:49.954
...that the Board
of Education hushed it up.

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:53.091
But if Yokoyama's
medical records...

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:54.628
...have been altered...

00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:55.856
...that means there
had to have been...

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:56.934
...someone who altered them.

00:05:58.036 --> 00:05:59.766
Although they may
not say anything...

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:02.471
...the media will get suspicious
about the Board of Education.

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.247
Really... Come to think of it...

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:18.594
...why do I need to lose my job
because of those shitty brats?

00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.460
Right, buddy?!

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.934
- Yeah.
- You think so, too?

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.239
They don't have manners.
They leave their textbooks at school.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:26.002
When I scold them,
they talk back.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.772
When it gets worse,
they use violence, too.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.508
They do Enjo Kosai.
They smoke tobacco.

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:33.987
In the end they call me bald
in public and laugh at me.

00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.389
With these kids...

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:37.653
...why do we need
to keep ourselves...

00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:40.127
...as Seishokusha?

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:44.735
Principal... Is she really
going up against the Board?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.566
No! No!

00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:47.767
I won't let it happen!

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.307
Whatever people
may say about me...

00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:52.143
...I won't let my little bit
of happiness be ruined!

00:06:54.853 --> 00:06:57.084
Can you do something
about that man?

00:06:57.323 --> 00:06:58.291
I'm sorry...

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.687
Really, he's a nuisance.

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.554
Seishokusha...

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:06.867
It sounds so sweet now...

00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:08.796
ODEN

00:07:08.907 --> 00:07:11.706
God, what do you want me,
Hiroshi Uchiyamada...

00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.074
...to do now...?

00:08:02.486 --> 00:08:04.978
Oh, Fuyutsuki-chan. What's up?

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:06.884
Staying up late is not
good for your skin.

00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:07.960
Get serious.

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:18.068
Onizuka-kun, what are you
going to do?

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:20.612
Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:25.919
Can you lend me some money?

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.848
You see,
Ryuji would make a fuss...

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.426
...and demand that I return
his money right away...

00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:32.054
I didn't think you would...

00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:33.461
If you lend money
to someone like me...

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:34.964
...you don't know
when it will be repaid...

00:08:38.772 --> 00:08:39.899
Please don't go...

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:44.380
I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time...

00:08:46.684 --> 00:08:50.782
Fuyu and Tsuki stand for
winter moon... It's a nice name.

00:08:51.892 --> 00:08:53.884
In winter the air is dry...

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.596
...so the moon looks much
clearer than it does right now...

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.301
Don't worry about me.

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.803
I'm going to another
extracurricular lesson as always.

00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.685
Here they come!

00:09:16.962 --> 00:09:18.089
We should go, too!

00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:20.200
Wait!

00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:22.431
Vice Principal! Quickly!

00:09:22.904 --> 00:09:24.372
I know... I know...

00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.294
We've been waiting for you.

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:49.738
Sakurai-san. I told you
that was an order.

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:52.338
You must be joking.

00:09:52.915 --> 00:09:56.045
Does the Board of Education
have such authority?

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:03.627
I don't have any intention...

00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:05.996
...of following
yesterday's two demands.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.578
Are you defending
a suspect accused of assault...

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.311
...and a violent teacher?

00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:23.287
Miyabi Aizawa might not
have stabbed Saito-sensei.

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:26.763
At least I believe she didn't do it.

00:10:27.265 --> 00:10:28.927
I also believe in Onizuka-sensei.

00:10:29.903 --> 00:10:33.567
Even though he might have
overstepped his authority...

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:35.902
...I won't fire him
because of that.

00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:37.909
Overstepped?!

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:39.607
It's not so easy!

00:10:39.817 --> 00:10:41.115
That was a threat!

00:10:41.453 --> 00:10:44.048
His being a teacher itself
is a big problem!

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:46.791
If you want us
to take responsibility...

00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:48.860
...I, as the principal, will do so.

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:53.698
But I have no intention of taking
Miyabi Aizawa to the police now.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.034
If we do,
no truth will be revealed...

00:10:57.177 --> 00:10:58.542
...and she may be
judged as a criminal.

00:10:59.613 --> 00:11:00.841
Truth?

00:11:01.817 --> 00:11:04.787
Saito-sensei might have
tried to commit suicide.

00:11:05.589 --> 00:11:07.147
Last year when his relationship...

00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:09.453
...was exposed by the media...

00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:12.065
...in front of his students,
Saito-sensei swore...

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:15.600
...that he would continue
the relationship with her.

00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:18.264
In spite of that...

00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:19.432
...he changed his position...

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:20.805
...and denied it in front of
the investigation committee.

00:11:21.812 --> 00:11:23.644
He was a very
enthusiastic teacher...

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.047
...who was respected
by his students.

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:27.353
I wonder if someone,
with such character...

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.514
...could lie to his students.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:35.062
I believe Saito-sensei
really loved Yokoyama.

00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:38.168
So when Saito found out
about Yokoyama's suicide...

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.637
...I think he wanted
to end his life, too.

00:11:41.408 --> 00:11:45.813
And why did he need
to lie in the first place?!

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:49.248
Are you trying to say
that we forced him to lie?

00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:51.422
Shoot!

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:52.752
What's the matter, Kikuchi?

00:11:53.058 --> 00:11:55.027
I was able to enter
the database...

00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:57.522
...but I don't see any trace
of alteration of the data.

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:00.492
Our enemy won't
be caught so easily...

00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:02.394
What should we do, Kikuchi?!

00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:04.201
The meeting has already started!

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.202
Don't blame Kikuchi!

00:12:08.447 --> 00:12:09.506
I know that!

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.148
Kikuchi...

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:12.241
What, Yoshikawa?!

00:12:12.353 --> 00:12:13.685
Why are you playing
a game at a time like this?!

00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:14.756
I'm not!

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.756
This looks like
Saito's home page.

00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:19.229
What?!

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:22.524
He seems to be responding
to his students' questions...

00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:23.997
Look at this...

00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:25.599
Let's see...

00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.639
I have had
a forbidden love affair.

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:34.075
So I really know
how hard and terrible it is.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.689
But I thought this way.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.851
What is best for our future?

00:12:40.596 --> 00:12:42.827
We shouldn't listen
to others' objections...

00:12:43.032 --> 00:12:44.693
...if we're okay,
that should be enough.

00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:47.230
But can we call it
real happiness?

00:12:47.672 --> 00:12:49.937
To be blessed by everyone...

00:12:50.243 --> 00:12:51.768
...that is the best.

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.810
So I have decided
to wait until then.

00:12:55.351 --> 00:12:56.682
Because I really love her...

00:12:57.687 --> 00:13:02.388
Saito-sensei didn't betray us!

00:13:03.028 --> 00:13:04.360
We have to let everyone know!

00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:07.025
All right. We should
go to the school!

00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:10.805
These days the erosion
of education is a big issue.

00:13:10.907 --> 00:13:14.436
So I understand that you
are very nervous about scandals.

00:13:14.913 --> 00:13:17.974
But in order to save the reputation
of your organization...

00:13:18.117 --> 00:13:19.415
...you have sacrificed two lives...

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.423
...no, to be precise, three lives.

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:25.485
That's stupid!

00:13:25.862 --> 00:13:27.592
You have no evidence.

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.764
And if the incident is revealed...

00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.598
...the reputation of this school...

00:13:32.705 --> 00:13:34.640
...which is considered elite,
will diminish.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.937
Are you still going
to defend one student?

00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:40.850
Yes.

00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:45.479
Hey, you guys. Why don't you
stop this insane principal?

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:48.724
She is about
to cost you your jobs.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:50.688
Prostrating Vice Principal.

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:52.592
How about you?

00:13:53.502 --> 00:13:54.697
What's the matter?

00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:58.438
We are not saying
you have to take responsibility.

00:13:58.877 --> 00:14:03.714
It's idiotic to throw away your life
for just one student, isn't it?

00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:05.818
Students nowadays...

00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:08.390
...have no respect
toward their teachers at all.

00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:09.818
They use violence
without hesitation...

00:14:09.927 --> 00:14:11.121
...and if there is
something they don't like...

00:14:11.228 --> 00:14:12.491
...they go out of control.

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:13.821
- Even if the student here...
- Wait...

00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:14.900
...attacked a person with a knife...

00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:16.230
-...it wouldn't come as a surprise.
- Hey...

00:14:16.336 --> 00:14:17.998
- And Enjo Kosai...
- Wait a minute...

00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:19.139
...not coming to school...

00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:21.037
- We've reached the limit.
- Wait a minute..!

00:14:21.143 --> 00:14:22.338
It's not your
or our responsibility...

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.748
I'm telling you to shut up!

00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:29.880
I won't allow any opinions
which insult the students!

00:14:30.457 --> 00:14:34.019
If in order to protect
the organization...

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:36.690
...the Board of Education
cornered Saito-sensei...

00:14:37.401 --> 00:14:40.530
...you are the criminals!

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:44.308
You aren't qualified
to discuss education!

00:14:44.978 --> 00:14:46.037
Vice Principal...

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.546
Isn't it right?!
Because of that...

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:50.016
...Mizuki Yokoyama
had to commit suicide!

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.855
That means you're the same
as murderers!

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.950
This is so stupid.
He doesn't make sense...

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:57.990
You're the ones who don't
make any sense!

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.892
Certainly, both this school
and the Board of Education...

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.366
...are organizations.

00:15:01.469 --> 00:15:03.870
But for whom do these
organizations exist?

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:07.542
They've never, ever been
for you or us teachers!

00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:10.741
All of these organizations
exist for the students!

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.885
No matter how devastated
the real world of education is...

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.512
...we should never
turn away from it...

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.625
...as professionals
of this sacred vocation...

00:15:17.893 --> 00:15:19.361
...and as teachers!

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:24.436
Bravo, Vice Principal!

00:15:24.536 --> 00:15:25.663
Oh, no, I'm just...

00:15:26.706 --> 00:15:28.231
I suppose there is no one...

00:15:28.342 --> 00:15:29.935
...who can discuss this
in a rational fashion...

00:15:30.278 --> 00:15:32.406
It's no use discussing this
with those of you who don't...

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.381
...recognize the authority
of the Board of Education.

00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:36.187
Effective immediately...

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:38.848
...I suspend the operational
license of Holy Forest Academy.

00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:41.257
Wait a minute!

00:15:41.862 --> 00:15:43.023
Onizuka!

00:15:43.664 --> 00:15:44.791
The reputation of the school?

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:47.100
The authority
of the Board of Education?

00:15:47.537 --> 00:15:49.506
What are those things?

00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:53.271
I can break them
down right now!

00:15:55.516 --> 00:15:56.710
Onizuka!

00:15:56.984 --> 00:15:57.974
You..!

00:15:58.219 --> 00:15:59.414
Vice Principal.

00:15:59.622 --> 00:16:01.716
If you yell too much,
your baldness will get worse.

00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:03.258
Is that right...?
What did you say?!

00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:05.726
Let's settle this now.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.830
What can you,
a mere schoolteacher, do?

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:11.404
OKINOSHIMA

00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:14.937
Go ahead.

00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:16.337
Roger.

00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:18.516
Please go to the conference
room on the third floor.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.739
Go! Hurry up!

00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:20.910
We're live, stand by!

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.109
What are you doing?!

00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:23.256
It's a violent attack...

00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:24.550
It's very close to it, Tomo-chan.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.729
You! What did you...?!

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:33.231
Here! Here they are!

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:39.440
Director Igarashi.

00:16:39.547 --> 00:16:41.982
Did Saito really have...

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.712
...a relationship
with a female student?

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.310
Did the Board of Education
force him to make...

00:16:45.455 --> 00:16:46.548
...a false statement
because you were afraid...

00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:47.955
...that the incident
would be revealed?

00:16:48.327 --> 00:16:50.762
This is shocking news.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.157
There is speculation that
the Board of Education had a role...

00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:56.064
...in a female student's suicide...

00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:57.332
This incident started...

00:16:57.707 --> 00:16:59.869
- What's on the news?
-...last June when a teacher...

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.036
- I don't care about that.
-...of an elite private school...

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.112
- Don't change it!
-...and his student had...

00:17:02.247 --> 00:17:04.045
...a relationship and their
photographs were revealed...

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.175
- Wow! Eikichi's there!
-...in a magazine...

00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:08.152
...which troubled
the Board of Education.

00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:11.258
Hey! You can't go
to the conference room!

00:17:12.528 --> 00:17:14.019
Hey, it's on TV!

00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:15.098
Let's go.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.234
What's going on?

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.568
Let's go in!

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:22.643
Yeah!

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.640
Is it true you hushed it up?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.405
There is no basis
for that insinuation!!

00:17:26.716 --> 00:17:27.774
But is it true that the student...

00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:29.112
- Eikichi...
-...committed suicide?

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.485
But it has nothing to do with us.

00:17:31.623 --> 00:17:33.558
There is a rumor that the female
student was pregnant...

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.092
...is it true that you made...

00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:36.788
...Saito give
a false statement?

00:17:37.532 --> 00:17:38.499
You are rude!

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:40.602
- Do you have evidence?
- Calm down, Director!

00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:43.273
The issue we have
before us now is that...

00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:47.311
...a female student at
Holy Forest stabbed Saito!

00:17:47.414 --> 00:17:48.676
That's not true.

00:17:49.183 --> 00:17:51.151
The one who stabbed
Saito isn't a student.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.986
It was me, Eikichi Onizuka,
22 years old.

00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:58.991
It was me, Eikichi Onizuka,
22 years old.

00:18:03.303 --> 00:18:06.206
What are you talking about?!
It was Miyabi Aizawa...

00:18:06.575 --> 00:18:09.067
This is the weapon...

00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:12.950
...with Saito's blood
and my fingerprints.

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:14.107
Do you have
a problem with that?

00:18:14.687 --> 00:18:16.416
- Oh, no.
- I don't care what you guys...

00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:18.285
- He finally did it.
-...have been doing.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.495
- Take me to Onizuka.
- But I will not allow you to turn...

00:18:21.597 --> 00:18:23.327
...my students into criminals!

00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:24.422
Quickly!

00:18:34.783 --> 00:18:35.751
Onizuka!

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.210
Teacher!

00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:42.022
Hey, you guys!
Don't skip school, all right?!

00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:43.285
Teacher!

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:44.364
Teacher!

00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:46.529
Don't worry. It'll work out.

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:47.892
Onizuka-sensei...

00:18:48.437 --> 00:18:49.426
Onizuka..!

00:18:49.772 --> 00:18:50.899
Onizuka...

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.217
Yes?

00:19:06.763 --> 00:19:07.731
Really?!

00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:09.827
Hey! Saito's awake!

00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:12.264
The hospital! Go to the hospital!

00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:13.964
Did you hear about it?

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:16.600
Now we'll find out
the real truth in this case.

00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:18.270
You've never forced Saito...

00:19:18.414 --> 00:19:19.779
...to make a false
statement, have you?

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.141
Director. Please
give us a comment.

00:19:21.251 --> 00:19:22.219
What's going on?

00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.450
What's the matter?
Are you going to run away?

00:19:24.824 --> 00:19:25.791
Teacher.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.555
Saito-sensei was seriously
trying to protect Yokoyama.

00:19:30.364 --> 00:19:31.832
Yoshikawa found it!

00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:34.668
That's great!

00:19:59.174 --> 00:20:00.540
You saved me...?

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.706
What? What are you
talking about?

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.288
I'm sorry!

00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:14.796
I'm sorry...

00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:31.886
We know
Saito stabbed himself...

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.923
...so why is Onizuka
being taken away?

00:20:34.493 --> 00:20:37.759
They can't just
release him, can they?

00:20:38.766 --> 00:20:39.733
Onizuka!

00:20:45.008 --> 00:20:46.339
What are you going to do?!

00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:47.411
He ran away!

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:48.712
What?!

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.575
After all, I didn't
want to get arrested!

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:54.854
I'm innocent!

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.862
TWO MONTHS LATER

00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:08.275
What's the matter,
Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.336
Nothing...

00:21:15.152 --> 00:21:18.783
From the look of it, I guess
he hasn't contacted you yet...

00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:21.990
Right... I wonder where
he is and what he's doing...

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.191
Don't worry.

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:27.268
As long as you are here,
he'll come back.

00:21:28.438 --> 00:21:29.633
Or do you want
to go chase after him?

00:21:45.865 --> 00:21:46.832
JUSTICE

00:21:56.554 --> 00:22:00.820
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:22:02.193 --> 00:22:07.290
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:12.065
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:22:13.037 --> 00:22:18.498
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:22:18.843 --> 00:22:24.110
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:22:24.382 --> 00:22:29.251
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:22:29.887 --> 00:22:34.620
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.658
So we can reach the horizon

00:22:41.399 --> 00:22:43.833
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:47.462
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:22:48.673 --> 00:22:52.939
Toward the finish line

00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:07.584
G-T-O?

00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:08.781
Yes!

00:23:08.993 --> 00:23:10.984
I am the great teacher Onizuka...

00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:12.823
...22 years old.

00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:15.293
Nice to meet you!

00:23:18.469 --> 00:23:25.966
SEE YA NEXT TIME
