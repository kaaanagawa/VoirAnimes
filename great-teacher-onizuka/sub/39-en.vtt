This means...

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.194
...we got lost, too?

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:47.370
It's your fault!
What are you going to do?!

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:49.099
Don't tell me...

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.269
Wow! We can't go home?!

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:52.607
No! I don't like it!

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:55.039
Don't yell so loudly!

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.780
Anyway, let's calm down
and find the exit. Okay?

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:05.848
What's this?

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.787
I can't take it anymore!

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:11.126
It's your fault! It was your idea
to have Yoshikawa get lost!

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:14.792
I get it! You're happy
if I do something! Right?!

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.036
Wait! It's dangerous!

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:18.933
There must be an exit somewhere.

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:26.372
Hey! That is someone's
voice, isn't it?! Below this...

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.274
What?! What happened?!

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:32.353
No!

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:35.555
Yoshikawa! Wait!

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.556
No! Wait!

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.454
What are you going to do?! No!

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.829
Yoshikawa!

00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:20.094
Uehara-san! Can you hear me?!
Answer me! Uehara-san!

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.361
Miss Uehara!

00:03:22.103 --> 00:03:25.504
- Help me!
- Don't struggle!

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:31.442
- Calm down, Uehara-san!
- Someone! Help me!

00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:46.958
Are you all right?

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:48.253
Uehara-san?

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:54.201
Am I all right?!
Because of you, I almost drowned!

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:57.032
What? I saved you!

00:03:57.138 --> 00:04:01.234
Saved?! Don't be so smug!
You're just Yoshikawa!

00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:04.507
- Really, he's useless!
- I shouldn't have saved her!

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:07.706
- Saved me?! Are you kidding?!
- My face still hurts...

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:12.382
Don't stare at me!

00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:13.749
- Look for the exit!
- I just caught your eye!

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:15.846
- You pervert!
- I see! I see!

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.422
I get it! I'm sorry!

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.533
Why do I have to...?

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.960
This is all Yoshikawa's fault!

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:33.032
Because he pulled that trick...
That's why I...

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:36.267
I'll get my revenge
when we get home...

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.187
Don't leave me alone! You idiot!

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:53.291
What are you talking about?
You told me to find the exit...

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.624
I'm a girl! Be sensitive!

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.907
Someone's voice! Hear it?!
It must be our rescuers!

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.169
You can hear it, can't you?!

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.108
Here! We're here!

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:12.770
Can you hear me?!

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.580
We're here!

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.947
- Please answer.!
- No! Stay away!

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.567
We were deceived
the first time, too.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.534
But it was not someone's voice.

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.135
The wind echoes in the cave...

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:42.538
...and it sounds like that...

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:44.533
So...

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:52.118
No! I didn't intend to do that!

00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:59.553
What's this?!

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:05.530
It's like a natural trap.
What's going on?

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.168
Help me. I don't like this place!

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.932
No! I don't want to die like this!

00:06:15.276 --> 00:06:20.976
I don't want to die here!
Please! Someone!

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:25.585
- Hello!
- Yoshikawa!

00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:27.579
- Uehara!
- Yoshikawa!

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.482
- Izumi!
- Asano!

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:34.260
- Shoot! Where did they go?
- Hey! Don't go too far!

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:38.593
In this huge jungle,
where should we start looking?!

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.570
What? Are you saying
if we take off your muzzle...

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:49.869
...in your grandpa's name...

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.275
...you swear that you can
find them in two seconds?

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:55.107
Don't mess with me!
You're "Yapoo."

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.783
Now you're my dog.
Do you understand, Yapoo?

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.112
If you do, don't use your head...

00:07:02.223 --> 00:07:04.384
... but use your nose
to find Yoshikawa!

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.552
Still complaining?

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:09.562
You want the habu
punishment again?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.956
Kanzaki, isn't it
time to forgive him?

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:14.398
Are you joking?!

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:16.834
The humiliation
I received is much worse!

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:18.733
- Because of that fanatical trio...
- I suppose...

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.000
-... I had to go through...
-...it has nothing to do with me...

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:24.401
Hum, Yapoo.

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.638
You want to be bitten
by the habu again...

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:30.512
Then we should put it in his anus
and let it bite his testicles.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.920
This isn't good.
Night is approaching...

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.754
We have to find them soon.

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:37.881
Otherwise, it's not
a joke anymore...

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:43.727
Oh, something is over there!

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:44.798
No!

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.595
Everyone! Go behind Yapoo
and use him as our shield!

00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:54.834
Izumi! Asano!

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.102
- What were you doing?!
- Are you guys alone?!

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:57.574
- We were looking for you!
- Where is Uehara? Yoshikawa?

00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.545
Anko fell into the sea...

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:03.310
Trying to help her,
Yoshikawa fell, too...

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:07.584
- Are you serious?
- Where did it happen?

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:10.319
What is it?!

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.288
Onizuka! Where are you going?!

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.929
Isn't he going
to search for Yoshikawa?

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.497
So where did he go
to search for him?

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:19.125
I wonder where...

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:24.968
Hey... Yoshikawa...

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.831
Are you sure
this is the way to the exit?

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.436
I don't know...

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:31.912
I see...

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:33.213
Of course...

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.106
Well...

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:40.286
The place we came in...
How about that place?

00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:41.577
There...

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:44.987
...the seawater from the outside
flows underground, I think...

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:46.858
It had a strong current.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.019
So I don't know how far
we were swept away...

00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:52.895
I think we were lucky...

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:55.993
I see...

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:02.598
If... If...

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.941
I remember now...

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.101
When we were in
the second year of junior high...

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:07.180
...you guys tied me up...

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.441
...at the foot-washing area
at the swimming pool...

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:10.015
...and you tortured me
with water...

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:13.312
The water was cold at that time.
It was in the winter...

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.647
Why are you saying this now?!
Are you stupid?

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.981
Idiot! Stupid Yoshikawa!

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.722
Hey...

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.164
Don't you think
the water is getting colder?

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:28.835
I wonder if the tide is coming in...

00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:31.832
It seems like it...

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:33.840
Look!

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.965
You see barnacles
on the ceiling?

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:38.935
It's evidence that water
usually reaches that far.

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:41.341
Then we can't breathe!

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:46.480
- Let's go...
- Yeah...

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:54.820
We'll be fine.

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.230
I bet teacher has noticed...

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:59.390
...we're missing
and is looking for us now.

00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.762
They can't find this place...

00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:07.107
First of all, why are you so calm?

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.169
We may die, you know!
Aren't you afraid?

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:12.077
Of course I'm afraid.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.179
Then why...?

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.874
I've been picked on
for a long time...

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.415
Maybe I'm used to being afraid...

00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:24.718
And if I panic, you will get
more scared, won't you?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.759
I'm a man, anyway...

00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:32.794
Why are you showing off?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.594
You're just Yoshikawa...

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.634
Hey! Yoshikawa!

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.436
What happened?!
Where are you going?!

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.043
- There is a tunnel under here.
- What?

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:48.875
Just a little bit,
but I could see a light.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.050
It may be coming from outside.

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.709
It may...?!

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.153
I'm going there to check it out!

00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.482
Wait! Yoshi.!

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:02.291
Are you serious?! Yoshikawa!

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:03.555
Yoshikawa!

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:08.338
!$&amp;%#;@Y!

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:16.101
Hey...

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:18.971
I really don't think
we need to wait here.

00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:21.236
It's better if we go back.
Definitely!

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.713
Are you listening to me?

00:11:24.682 --> 00:11:25.979
It's cold here, too.

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.916
I can't sleep like this.!

00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:32.116
We're keeping watch.
So don't worry.

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:33.190
You are...

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.452
-... more timid than you let on.
- What?!

00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:37.718
What are you talking about?!
Stupid Murai!

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:38.818
Idiot Murai!

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.295
- Mama's boy Murai!
- What did you say?!

00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:42.063
Mama's boy!

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.666
I'm not protecting you anymore!

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:47.237
(That's all right!
I'll have Kikuchi to protect me!)

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:48.702
(What?! Is that a big admission?!)

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:50.172
(Then I'll have Horikawa!)

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:53.272
(- Wow!)
(- What?! How about me?!)

00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.503
- Hey, Kikuchi...
(- Murai, you seem...)

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:55.579
(...to be enjoying this!)

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.510
- Is it a good idea to have a fire...?
(- Shut up!)

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.742
- Don't do it.
(- I'm always like this.!)

00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:01.011
(Why can't I be...)

00:12:01.152 --> 00:12:02.414
- I wonder if Yoshikawa...
(-...the cool one?)

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.509
-...and Uehara are okay...
(- I guess it's your character...)

00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:05.053
(Then for me, Shioyama!)

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:06.814
- Yoshikawa is with her.
(- Why can't I be included...)

00:12:06.991 --> 00:12:08.390
- They must be fine.
(-...when it comes to being sexy?)

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.059
- Yeah...
(- I came all the way to Okinawa...)

00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:11.287
(...and I'm treated like this!
What's going on?!)

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:12.363
- Oh, how about Onizuka-sensei...
(- Who is in charge here?!)

00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:13.430
...and Kanzaki...?

00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:14.793
(- You have Fukada!)
(- Don't mention that name!)

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:16.662
- Onizuka is with her.
(- Then I'll settle for Fujiyoshi!)

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:19.264
(Wow! Cool!)

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:20.697
I can't say...

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.234
Onizuka! Stop! Where...?!

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.340
I'm headed for Yoshikawa
and Uehara, of course!

00:12:28.513 --> 00:12:30.743
Damn! Those guys!
They fell in the ocean?!

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:32.607
I know what they're up to!

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.547
Treasure! They must
have found the treasure!

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:38.145
And they are trying
to steal it all for themselves!

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:40.053
Shit! I will never let you get away!

00:12:40.491 --> 00:12:42.686
What are you talking about?!

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:45.786
I'm not mistaken!
My nose tells me so!

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.692
I understand! So stop
and calm down and discuss.!

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.736
Wait for me! Yoshikawa! Uehara!

00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:03.812
Hey... Not yet...?

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.714
Yoshikawa!

00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:11.087
Yoshikawa-kun!

00:13:14.826 --> 00:13:15.815
Hey! Yoshikawa!

00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:17.086
Don't toy with me!

00:13:17.328 --> 00:13:18.454
I won't forgive you!

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:40.985
What are you doing?!

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.419
I thought you were dead.!

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:46.885
It's the exit! I've found the exit!

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:48.755
- What?
- It's ahead.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.918
I saw the light in the distance.

00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.626
It must be coming
from the outside!

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:52.855
If we dive for a minute or so...

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:56.023
A minute?! No way! I can't!

00:13:57.535 --> 00:13:58.729
The wave is coming again!

00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:00.167
Hurry up! Quickly!

00:14:00.271 --> 00:14:01.465
But.!

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.096
Of course, I can't do it!

00:14:03.207 --> 00:14:04.572
- Uehara-san!
- No! I won't go!

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:05.870
Uehara-san!

00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:12.776
You can do it. Trust me.

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.767
Who is it? Someone is crying.

00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:07.664
That is...

00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:09.462
...me?

00:15:09.974 --> 00:15:11.669
Onii-chan...

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:18.075
Why are you mean to me?

00:15:20.118 --> 00:15:23.554
I'm not doing anything wrong...

00:15:24.555 --> 00:15:28.013
Return my doll...

00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:31.586
Yuichi Nii-chan...

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:33.121
Why?!

00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:38.863
Yuichi! Where is Yuichi?!

00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:41.801
What are these grades?!

00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:44.068
Why do you think
I'm paying lots of money...

00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:46.540
...to send you to a private school?

00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:48.444
You're my oldest son!

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:50.608
Aren't you a man?!

00:15:57.855 --> 00:15:59.152
That's mine.!

00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:05.589
Onii-chan...

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.163
Why are you mean to me?

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:15.199
Don't you like me?

00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:20.241
Yuichi Nii-chan... I...

00:16:23.114 --> 00:16:24.843
I like you very much...

00:16:55.246 --> 00:16:56.235
Uehara-san!

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:00.178
Are you awake? Are you all right?

00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:01.911
Do you have any pain?

00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:04.352
You may have hit your head...

00:17:06.357 --> 00:17:07.415
Uehara-san?

00:17:08.092 --> 00:17:09.787
Well, I'll touch you...

00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:15.322
You swallowed
some water, didn't you?

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:16.491
Can you breathe
without any pain?

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.102
Look, Uehara-san.

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:27.670
I think this was a church
and an air-raid shelter before.

00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:30.712
There are old plates
and ammunition.

00:17:30.982 --> 00:17:32.415
Anyway, there were
people here before.

00:17:32.517 --> 00:17:34.883
- So there must be...
- I see...

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:36.577
-...an exit somewhere...
- I...

00:17:38.623 --> 00:17:39.715
- After resting a little...
- I...

00:17:39.824 --> 00:17:40.848
I can start to search...

00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.323
- Yoshikawa!
- What?

00:17:44.495 --> 00:17:47.396
To tell the truth... I...

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.060
I...

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:02.204
Teacher!

00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:04.973
Yoshikawa! You're here!

00:18:08.186 --> 00:18:10.780
Oh! I did it! 2 billion! 2 billion!

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.653
I've got them! Hooray!

00:18:16.727 --> 00:18:17.694
That's...?

00:18:18.596 --> 00:18:21.121
I've found the hidden treasure!

00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:24.499
Teacher,
you came to save us. Right?

00:18:24.602 --> 00:18:26.331
What happened to you?

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.031
I've got Onizuka-sickness,
no, motion-sickness...

00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:35.102
Now I'm a billionaire! Right?!

00:18:35.213 --> 00:18:36.680
How about that?!

00:18:39.317 --> 00:18:40.579
Teacher...

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:43.550
That isn't it...

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:48.992
What? I see. You're still
trying to steal it from me...

00:18:49.093 --> 00:18:51.357
I won't be deceived.

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.962
This treasure is mine!

00:18:54.098 --> 00:18:55.429
The treasure box!

00:19:03.207 --> 00:19:05.903
Stay there!

00:19:06.877 --> 00:19:10.677
Wait, Onizuka! Stop! Stop!
Don't move! Calm down!

00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:14.816
Oh, Kanzaki...
So what should I do with this?

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:17.646
Don't move!

00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:20.554
Oh! You guys.!

00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:53.388
Onizuka.!

00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:54.480
Is he...?

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:56.026
Where are you?

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.459
Teacher!

00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:02.554
Treasure!

00:20:04.035 --> 00:20:05.229
- An octopus!
- You!

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:06.633
- I'll kill you!
- What did you do?!

00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:07.704
He has a lot of energy.

00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:10.171
He must have hidden
in the hole he had dug.

00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:11.536
Maybe he just fell in it.

00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:15.770
Ah, Uehara-san...

00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:19.541
That time in the cave...

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.242
...what were you going to say?

00:20:28.092 --> 00:20:29.821
What are you talking about?

00:20:30.394 --> 00:20:35.024
- You pervert! Idiot!
- What?! Stop it! I'm sorry!

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:38.499
A body!

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:40.500
We hauled up a drowned body!

00:20:44.442 --> 00:20:49.106
Vice Principal!

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.241
I didn't see him.!
We have another problem!

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.408
Who is going
to take responsibility?!

00:20:53.517 --> 00:20:54.916
Now's not the time to discuss it!

00:20:57.121 --> 00:21:00.488
Teachers!
Please identify the body!

00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:08.398
Onizuka.!

00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:17.229
Onizuka!

00:21:24.315 --> 00:21:25.805
Vice Principal!

00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:28.682
He is alive...

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:32.978
Be strong!

Yoshikawa...

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:20.186
What is it?

00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:23.951
If you like, the two of us...

00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:27.025
...can be together
the last night in Okinawa...

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.328
To tell you the truth, I've been
thinking about you for a long time...

00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:37.939
Good memories...

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:41.935
I WANT YOU.

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:43.478
I'm not mentally prepared yet...

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:45.805
I'm not ready.!

00:23:46.015 --> 00:23:53.820
