This is it. Momoko Hoshino's

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:46.494
What's this?!

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:49.931
It should be illegal for a 16-year-old
to have such a sexy body!

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:55.911
But I don't think
you should be enjoying this with us.

00:01:56.308 --> 00:01:58.299
What's going on
with Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:01.117
There was some chemistry between you two
the other day, wasn't there?

00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:04.814
No, no. An adult relationship
is not that simple.

00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.588
I'd rather get the kind of girl
who is exuding pheromones...

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.488
What's a pheromone?

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:13.461
Where is the faculty room?

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.824
Gross!

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.096
The faculty room?

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:19.558
That way.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.658
Thank you.

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:23.828
Are you a teacher at this school?

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.997
I'm the homeroom teacher for 3-4.

00:02:26.108 --> 00:02:28.702
Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old.
A bachelor.

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:31.209
I'm Nao Kadena.

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:33.747
I'm working in the infirmary
here as of today.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.339
Call me Nao-chan.

00:02:36.268 --> 00:02:37.462
Nao-chan?

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:39.501
My measurements are...

00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:41.538
...secret!

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:45.116
Nice to meet you,
Onizuka-sensei.

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.861
Is that really a teacher?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.257
I'm so happy to be a teacher
in this school.

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:03.264
As of today, Kadena-sensei
is working in the infirmary.

00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:05.534
Please Kadena.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.036
I'm Nao Kadena.
Nice to meet you all.

00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:16.115
Where is Oni...something-sensei?

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:20.747
Onizuka-sensei must be spending
his time somewhere.

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:24.658
He's always like that.
Right, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:26.125
Well, yes.

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:29.161
As Vice Principal,
I'll give you some advice.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.133
It's better for you
to stay away from him.

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:37.898
He's evil and a germ
in our school.

00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:41.405
By the way, Kadena-sensei...

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:44.639
...as a person working
in an educational environment...

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:48.808
...isn't your outfit
a little bit too flashy?

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.322
Really? I chose plain clothes
from my closet.

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:54.948
But you...

00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:58.888
Don't you like these clothes?

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.294
Well, no, I don't mean
that I don't like them...

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.233
I'm so glad!

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:08.532
Please give me
useful advice from now on.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.576
In front of other teachers...
They may misunderstand us...

00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:15.801
FACULTY ROOM

00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:20.941
Hey, Nao-chan is really
a nurse in the infirmary.

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:24.815
She's so sexy.
Good competition for Murai's mom.

00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:28.016
Idiot! There is no comparison!

00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:31.657
The Vice Principal was
very taken with her.

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:35.856
The rumor that he likes women
may be true.

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:36.990
What?

00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:42.728
What are you doing,
Onizuka-sensei?

00:04:43.273 --> 00:04:45.036
Your classroom is
on the other side.

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:46.867
Well, ah...

00:04:46.977 --> 00:04:49.639
I have a fever of 120 degrees.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.806
I have constipation and diarrhea.
And I'm dizzy, too.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.612
I have morning sickness
and no appetite.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.650
You don't look sick.
Your complexion is good.

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:01.417
Really?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.523
Ohhh, I'm dying.
I've gotta go to the infirmary.

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:08.958
Onizuka-sensei.

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.158
That's pretty bad.

00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.169
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

00:05:16.573 --> 00:05:19.940
No doubt about it.
She likes me!

00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:23.843
I put on new underwear.
I washed my hair.

00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:27.781
Now I can play an adult
version of Doctor with Nao-chan.

00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:31.179
Nao-chan!

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:35.513
What are you guys doing here?!

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:38.924
We have stomachaches.

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.018
That's right!

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.097
Liar!

00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:43.723
You, too, are planning
to get friendly with Nao-chan...

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:46.632
... by faking an illness.
I can see your plan!

00:05:47.738 --> 00:05:49.296
You said, "You, too..."

00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:50.598
Well, no...

00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.402
Welcome, Onizuka-sensei.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.243
They told me...

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:59.111
...that you were in a famous
motorcycle gang in Shonan.

00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:04.546
Not really...
I was just young.

00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:06.887
It's quite a challenge...

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.120
...to put together those violent
motorcycle gangs in Shonan.

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:13.360
You know about them?

00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:17.428
Not really. Rather than discuss that,
why don't you have a cup of coffee?

00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:19.024
I have cake, too.

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:22.037
Everyone is welcome
in my infirmary.

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.967
Let's all get along.

00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:33.645
Everyone. Please come
to the infirmary anytime.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.581
It's the oasis of this school.

00:06:35.752 --> 00:06:37.344
I'll be waiting for you.

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:39.654
What's that? Looks stupid.

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:43.352
She's using her sex appeal
to be popular with the boys.

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.886
She's just an old lady
with heavy make-up.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.392
I guess I need to greet her.

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:50.727
Watch me.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.105
Excuse me!

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.639
Are you okay?

00:07:04.648 --> 00:07:06.275
Yes. I'm sorry.

00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:11.243
Wait a minute!

00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:16.185
What type of cosmetics
are you using?

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:20.521
You have nice skin.
This kind isn't good for you.

00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:23.559
Taking care of your skin
is en vogue now.

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:28.201
There's a good skin care
product on sale now.

00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:32.164
I can talk to you anytime.
Why don't you stop by the infirmary?

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.038
See you.

00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:42.616
School is fun, isn't it?

00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:45.083
Banzai to teachers!

00:07:45.255 --> 00:07:48.122
Let's go to the next one!

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:50.250
You're already wasted.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.956
But everyone is suffering
in this poor economy.

00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:57.962
You are the only one
without worries.

00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:01.502
I guess something good
happened at school.

00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:02.594
For example...

00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:05.539
...an attractive nurse began
working in the school's infirmary.

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:07.710
Is that true?

00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:10.871
I see. You're jealous.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:12.771
It's a pleasant problem!

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:16.249
No. I don't care about you.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.822
My concern is the students who stay
in the infirmary during class.

00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.792
That's what you say. But the truth is
you're thinking of me...

00:08:26.663 --> 00:08:30.121
Suit yourself.
I'd better go home now...

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.302
Listen, Eikichi. I understand
that you like women.

00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:36.804
But if you keep looking
around like that...

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.841
...Fuyutsuki-chan may
eventually hate you.

00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:43.337
Stop! Don't throw up on me!

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:51.418
Kadena-sensei...

00:08:52.656 --> 00:08:53.987
What's the matter?

00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:55.518
Nothing.

00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:00.424
Are you all right, Onizuka?

00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:11.966
Kadena-sensei.

00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:16.745
The other girls in the class
want that product you gave me.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.313
The diet cream, too.
Everyone is asking about it.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.781
Do you still have some?

00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:22.874
Of course.

00:09:25.188 --> 00:09:29.022
But cash only, please.

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:32.092
And don't tell the other teachers.

00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:35.528
Nao-chan.

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:39.495
Boxes of health food and diet tea
have just arrived.

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:44.633
See you later, Teacher.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.501
The Black Stars are in Class 1.

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:50.670
They've changed a lot.

00:09:51.148 --> 00:09:53.309
Thank you.
Could you leave them there?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.717
Yes.

00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:58.415
When you bring all of them,
as your prize, I can give you...

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:02.924
...this "Super Dynamite Protein"
muscle builder...

00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:06.689
...and a "Gold Cat" for happiness
with a 30% discount.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.961
We don't have any more money.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:13.430
We just got "Magic Turtle Charms"
for getting girlfriends.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.203
Then how about half price?

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:16.294
Okay with me!

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:17.532
Me, too.

00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:22.635
What are those?

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:25.148
Oh, well...

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:26.508
Never mind.

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:27.910
It's nothing.

00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:32.984
A business in the infirmary?

00:10:33.657 --> 00:10:37.855
Yes. And when I checked them,
they were questionable goods.

00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:41.686
Not only do the boys do
whatever Kadena-sensei says...

00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:43.356
... but the girls, too.

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:46.329
Questionable goods...?

00:10:46.803 --> 00:10:50.364
I wonder if I should report this
to the principal.

00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:55.601
But Kadena-sensei may need
the money for something...

00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:02.718
Please listen to me seriously!
I'm here to ask for your advice.

00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:08.148
Aren't they all...?
You, too, Onizuka-sensei?

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.725
Oh, well, Fuyutsuki-chan...

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:14.991
...when I played Pachinko
with this Happy Cat pendant...

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:19.033
...I was on top of my game.
I won ten in a row. Ten in a row!

00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:21.368
So it may be working...

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:27.441
Would you like to have one?
I can give you a good discount.

00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:29.008
No, thank you!

00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:33.105
Wait, Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:11:33.283 --> 00:11:34.375
Ouch!

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.785
THE BLACK STARS

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.545
Is that so bad, Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.283
But you're doing it in school!

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:50.687
The students are happy.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:53.523
They say they can get
what they want at low prices.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.821
Has anyone complained about it?

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.559
Not really...

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:00.834
If you want to tell the principal,
please go ahead.

00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:05.502
But I don't think you'd
tattle on your coworkers.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.334
Do you need money that bad?

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:11.946
Bad enough to do business
with the students at the school?

00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.379
Bad enough to work
at a nightclub?

00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.643
You knew?

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.682
I happened to see you
the other day.

00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:21.382
That job doesn't bring in
as much money as it seems.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.516
When we can't collect money
from customers, we have to pay...

00:12:24.627 --> 00:12:27.187
...out of our pockets. The worst case
is when you lose money.

00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:28.757
What...?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:32.229
But when I get close to CEO's...

00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:36.869
... I can gain insider information
and make a prof it from the stock.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.131
Stocks, too...?

00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.442
I'm not just earning a little money
by doing business with students.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.669
Although some kids are
richer than some adults these days.

00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:51.947
You aren't teaching
as a volunteer, are you?

00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:56.755
Teaching is a sort of business, too.

00:12:56.892 --> 00:13:01.090
I just need more money than others.
That's the only difference.

00:13:01.664 --> 00:13:05.361
Whatever your reasons, don't use
the students for your own prof it.

00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:07.095
It's not fair to the students.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:10.639
There's always teachers like you
in the schools where I've worked.

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:13.105
They only worried
about outside appearances...

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.938
...and just talked about theories.

00:13:15.077 --> 00:13:16.169
How dare you...!

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:18.641
Do you want to bet?

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:19.881
Bet?

00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:23.982
What's the bet?

00:13:24.653 --> 00:13:27.747
Kadena-sensei says she will put
Murai and the others in the top 50...

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:30.223
...when they take
the next trial exam.

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:34.129
But Nao-chan is a nurse
in the infirmary.

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:38.394
I don't think she studied to teach.
Of course, I didn't, either.

00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:41.898
I think she looks down
on teaching jobs.

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:46.532
If it was so easy to pad the grades,
there wouldn't be a problem.

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:48.772
So how much was the bet?

00:13:48.944 --> 00:13:50.138
100,000 yen.

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:52.314
100,000?!

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.314
Of course, I declined.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.708
Why?!

00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:59.211
Isn't it clear?
I can't bet on something like that.

00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:00.921
What a waste!

00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:03.217
You can make 100,000 yen
without doing anything.

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:07.323
Murai and the others
could never get in the top 50...

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:08.726
...even with a miracle.

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:11.026
As their homeroom teacher,
I guarantee that.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.201
Here's an idea.
I can bet for you.

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.401
Top 50?!

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:19.841
It's impossible, Nao-chan.

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:22.509
Among us, the best one is...

00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:25.210
... Fujiyoshi's rank in the 200's.

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.706
Sorry, but...

00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:32.476
If you get to the top 50,
I can go out with you.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:37.318
Don't you want to be
with an adult woman?

00:14:43.832 --> 00:14:46.198
Study by yourself. Yo Ro Shi Ku

00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:53.205
You're noisy! Be quiet!
I can't study!

00:15:06.922 --> 00:15:08.753
I can't remember...

00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:10.048
What?

00:15:10.526 --> 00:15:15.088
Your nurse in the infirmary
who works at the nightclub.

00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:18.366
Nao-chan?
Is she working at a nightclub?

00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:20.868
You were drunk.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.261
Fuyutsuki-chan told me,
and I was amazed.

00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:28.265
But I think I saw her somewhere.

00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:33.538
She gets attention just walking
in downtown Kichijoji.

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.344
She is so dazzling.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.745
It's not in Kichijoji.
It was...

00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:41.823
Mister, I need a second helping.
Give me a lot!

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.729
ENGLISH EXAM

00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:01.065
Onizuka-sensei. The results
of the trial exam came in!

00:16:01.176 --> 00:16:02.302
Is that so?

00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:03.708
Murai and the others did a great job!

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:07.440
What? Are you saying
that the Three Stooges did it?

00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:10.552
Please!

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:11.620
In the top 50!

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.880
I'd be happy with 49th!

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.413
KUNIO MURAI

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:17.416
TADAAKI KUSANO

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.487
KOJI FUJIYOSHI

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.156
What a relief!

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:26.398
Don't give me a heart attack,
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:29.703
I thought they made it in the top 50.

00:16:29.805 --> 00:16:30.794
Pity!

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:31.895
Shit.

00:16:32.007 --> 00:16:34.066
It's not a pity at all.

00:16:34.543 --> 00:16:36.670
It's good! I made 100,000!

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:41.782
But Murai and the others got scores
they've never reached before.

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:43.349
Don't you think it's amazing?

00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:46.216
Amazing!
It's a miracle!

00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:50.921
How did Kadena-sensei teach you?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.759
Well...

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:56.663
They cheated, of course.

00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:00.496
No. We really studied hard.

00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:04.803
Yeah. We asked Kikuchi
how to prepare for the exam.

00:17:05.207 --> 00:17:10.201
You seriously studied?
Don't joke with me!

00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:13.074
Tell me the truth.

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:17.315
It's true! Nao-chan said
if we got to the top 50...

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.581
...she would teach us what it's like
to be with an adult woman.

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:21.656
That's why...

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.322
What?!

00:17:23.492 --> 00:17:24.925
What?!

00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:27.358
How can you get
such a good treat?

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:31.900
Oh, no. Now I see
why you studied so hard.

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:33.664
I can't stand her anymore.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.297
Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:38.200
FAT BURNING PILLS

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.036
Is what Murai said true?

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.109
Yes.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.646
If I was in on that bet,
I would have lost.

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.043
Even though they didn't end up
in the top 50...

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.811
...you did a great job
getting Murai and the others...

00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:51.510
...to get such high scores.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.716
But your method to tempt
the students was wrong!

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:57.117
Why?

00:17:57.292 --> 00:17:58.520
Because...

00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:01.461
That's a little magic.

00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:03.724
It was effective, wasn't it?

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:05.255
Magic?

00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:08.534
All men, students
or old bald guys, are the same.

00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:11.401
They're attracted
to something sexy.

00:18:11.807 --> 00:18:15.573
Don't compare the students
to nightclub customers!

00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:17.372
This is a school!

00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:20.676
Don't get so upset,
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:24.751
I can't help teasing you,
a naive teacher...

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.378
...who doesn't know the real world.

00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:30.117
Is that all? See you.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.724
Wait a minute!

00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:32.816
Nao-chan...

00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:36.963
Sorry. I had a bet with you.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:39.198
Here's 100,000 yen.

00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:40.325
Are you serious?!

00:18:40.903 --> 00:18:42.768
Oh, not that...

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.673
If these guys had made the top 50...

00:18:45.774 --> 00:18:47.901
...would you have really
gone out with them?

00:18:48.577 --> 00:18:49.771
How disappointing...

00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:54.280
You are going to preach to me
like a holy teacher?

00:18:54.449 --> 00:18:57.543
I thought you would understand.

00:18:57.653 --> 00:18:59.883
After all,
you are the same as the others.

00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:01.546
Nothing like that.

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:06.153
I just want to know if you really
promised them that. I'm jealous!

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:09.688
Don't kid me.

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:12.358
I told you it was magic.

00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:17.397
Get serious. Magic?!
You just tricked them.

00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:20.936
I don't allow anyone
to trick my students.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.744
So what do you want me to do?

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.741
I'll return this money.
Let's redo the bet.

00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:30.250
Hey, Murai!

00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:35.119
You study hard
and get in the top 50 this time

00:19:35.224 --> 00:19:38.091
if you want an adult
relationship with Nao-chan.

00:19:38.193 --> 00:19:39.160
What?!

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.751
Onizuka-sensei!

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.460
This time, no tricks.

00:19:47.803 --> 00:19:48.895
Sorry, everyone.

00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:52.036
But I was planning to go out
on a date with you. Really.

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:55.808
I was wrong.

00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:58.641
You are different
from other teachers.

00:19:58.747 --> 00:20:00.009
As expected...

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.913
...you're a former Onibaku
who controlled Shonan.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:09.921
Ohhhhhh!

00:20:10.025 --> 00:20:11.390
100,000 yen...!

00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:14.286
Oh, crap...

00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:23.194
Oh, Ryuji?
What did you remember?

00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:24.669
It's Nao-chan.

00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:25.740
What?

00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:29.544
When we were in the middle
of a turf war in Shonan...

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:33.479
...I visited my friend in Yokohama.

00:20:33.615 --> 00:20:36.209
He was a street racer.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:40.614
There, I saw "Queen of Hakosuka."

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:47.359
All the street racers respected her.

00:20:47.462 --> 00:20:49.657
She was like a queen.

00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:51.523
In a crazy race called...

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.191
..."Last Signal" which ignored
traffic signals, she never lost...

00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:57.930
...and she was a legendary racer.
"Queen of Hakosuka."

00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:06.539
That was the nurse
in the infirmary...

00:21:06.949 --> 00:21:08.883
...Nao Kadena.

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:13.218
I heard this later...

00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:19.056
...she lost the race to an unknown
racer and had an accident.

00:21:19.161 --> 00:21:21.789
And she left the group.

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:29.259
But people couldn't believe
her loss, and it's still a mystery.

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.199
Queen of Hakosuka...

00:21:47.898 --> 00:21:52.631

What can I do?

00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:22.717
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:25.023
After all, you're all bystanders.
No one understands how I feel.

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:30.834
I don't want to understand
how you feel.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.038
What are you thinking?!

00:23:35.773 --> 00:23:40.733
Rather than thinking about the past,
isn't it better off if you die?
