WEBVTT

00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:11.492
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:16.568
I don't just feel it

00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:23.376
This street makes me love

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:27.145
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:32.284
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:37.623
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:42.934
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:48.501
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:54.144
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:54.981 --> 00:01:00.351
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:05.718
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:10.886
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:18.766
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.338
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:26.139
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:44.914
My name is Hiroshi Uchiyamada.

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:48.250
I was born in Kanuma City
in Tochigi in 1946.

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:50.746
I'm a baby-boomer.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:53.381
When I was little,
I was called a genius.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.957
I entered the Tokyo University
of Education...

00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.323
... through a recommendation.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.829
After graduation,
I was determined to be an educator.

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.297
My current position is Vice Principal
at the elite private school...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.389
... Seirin Gakuen. (Holy Forest)

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.706
As an educator,
I have faced many problems.

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:12.037
School violence, sexual conduct
among the young...

00:02:12.143 --> 00:02:13.804
... bullying, refusal to go to school...

00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:19.475
However, I am facing the biggest
problem of my career right now!

00:02:19.617 --> 00:02:20.743
It is...

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.184
Hey, Onizuka's class
is doing something again!

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:24.379
Let's go and see!

00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:26.956
Onizuka!

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:29.757
Where?! Where?!
Where?! Where?!

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.231
Onizuka!

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.338
I'm telling you again.

00:02:49.447 --> 00:02:51.745
If you have a problem,
please go see the principal.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.647
She's the one who told us...

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:55.720
...to repaint the wall
because it's shabby.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.186
She said, "Repaint."

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.689
Who said to draw graffiti?!

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.186
Don't call it graffiti.

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:06.127
It's art...art!
Don't you understand?

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:09.223
How could you call it art?
It's graffiti in bad taste.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:15.432
Someone said all American
modern art started from street graffiti...

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:18.303
That's not the point!
You shut up!

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.709
Why did you get your students
involved in this?

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:25.446
Of course, it's more fun
to do it together.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.385
Here's an idea. Let's make it
their senior project, shall we?

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.649
It's already been decided
their senior project...

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:34.952
...will be a relief
of Mt. Yatsugatake.

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.653
Paint over it right away!

00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:43.199
Oh, no. I'm sorry!!

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.929
Towel! Bring a towel!

00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:48.528
Are you okay, Vice Principal?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.467
Oh, I guess this doesn't work.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:54.534
Onizuka!

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.282
The paint is off....

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.251
...but at least a hundred
of my precious hairs are gone.

00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:04.418
SHOWER ROOM
I'm sweating like a pig!

00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:07.816
We have to hurry up!
Class is going to start...

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.553
Glasses, glasses...

00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.192
How irritating...

00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:22.173
A female student's scream
that can almost cut through silk!

00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:25.435
Who is calling me, Hajime Fukuroda,
PE teacher and protector of justice?

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:28.339
- Pervert!
- The old guy is naked!

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.778
No! You made
a mistake coming in!

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.777
This pervert!
How did you get in?!

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:35.614
No, wait, Fukuroda!

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.592
Ouch...

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:48.825
Why me?

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:52.596
They are the ones who came
into the men's shower room.

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:57.703
He hit me
because I looked suspicious...

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:58.901
That's stupid!

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:03.605
How could I, the devoted
model educator, look suspicious?

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:07.675
- Look at that man.
- Spooky. He looks suspicious...

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:11.378
Oh, boy...

00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:14.153
The only peaceful place
is my home.

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:19.891
My beloved wife, lovely daughter,
my dear sweet home.

00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:24.263
Here's an idea. Let's have
Sukiyaki for dinner tonight.

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.459
I'm home.

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:30.671
- Welcome home.
- You're home early tonight.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:33.473
Here's a surprise, Yoshiko.

00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:36.513
Wow, Sukiyaki!
I love you, Dad!

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:39.410
Let's eat!

00:05:45.757 --> 00:05:50.694
Yoshiko, Ryoko. Wait for me.
I'm coming home now.

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:53.587
I'm home!

00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:55.198
Welcome home!

00:05:56.901 --> 00:06:01.304
You're late, Vice Principal.
What happened to you?

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:04.569
You, you, you!
Why are you at my house?

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:07.440
The principal asked me to deliver
some documents for the meeting.

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.877
She couldn't give them to you.

00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.539
What?

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.745
What's this? Meat?
Wow, you're a good family man!

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:20.756
Wow, Sukiyaki meat!
Let's have Sukiyaki for dinner!

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:22.917
That sounds good!

00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:25.655
There is no meat for you!
Why don't you leave now?!

00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:28.254
You've invaded the only
peaceful place in my life!

00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:32.961
Dear, what are you saying?
He came all this way.

00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:38.900
Onizuka-sensei,
please have dinner with us.

00:06:40.378 --> 00:06:43.779
You have a student who entered
show business, don't you?

00:06:44.983 --> 00:06:48.384
Oh, Nomura.
Yes, I was her agent.

00:06:48.953 --> 00:06:51.615
Wow, do you have
a show business connection?

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:54.587
I wouldn't call it a connection,
but I have some acquaintances.

00:06:55.093 --> 00:06:58.460
Can you get some tickets?
There is a live show I want to go to.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.860
What are you talking about?
You need to study!

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.158
Excuse me, may I have seconds?

00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:05.326
Sure, please eat
as much as you want.

00:07:05.436 --> 00:07:08.030
It's fun to have a young one visit.

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:11.605
Sorry, I'm an old man.

00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:13.567
Beer!

00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:17.111
Don't worry, Vice Principal.
You don't need to treat me like that.

00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:19.475
It's not for you. It's mine.

00:07:20.018 --> 00:07:24.284
It's in the refrigerator, of course.
Go and get your own beer.

00:07:24.422 --> 00:07:25.889
What...?

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.355
Oh, Yoshiko.

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:28.789
After dinner...

00:07:28.893 --> 00:07:32.226
...why don't you ask Onizuka-sensei
to check your homework?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.763
What? But...

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:36.959
No, you can't let this monkey
in Yoshiko's room!

00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:38.899
You shut up!

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:43.770
I heard it. You had a perfect score
on the trial exam!

00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:46.541
Well, I guess I did...

00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:48.406
That must be a mistake.

00:07:48.513 --> 00:07:50.003
You're going to have
an entrance exam this year.

00:07:50.114 --> 00:07:52.981
If you have any questions,
it's better to ask a teacher.

00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:55.515
Onizuka-sensei, please?!

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:57.154
Count on me.

00:07:57.255 --> 00:08:01.521
I, perfect score maker,
will take care of your daughter.

00:08:02.493 --> 00:08:04.324
Teacher, this way.

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:06.524
Thank you.

00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:07.688
No problem.

00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.062
What's happening?

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.662
Both my wife and Yoshiko
are deceived by the beast.

00:08:16.274 --> 00:08:21.109
I'm the only one
who can protect Yoshiko.

00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:24.341
Cute!

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:25.575
Tea-cher!

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:30.315
This is the penis.

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:31.410
Oh, no!

00:08:31.522 --> 00:08:33.513
What?! What are you doing?

00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:35.524
Listen to me! Come here!

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:37.093
Don't bite there!

00:08:37.195 --> 00:08:38.162
Don't resist!

00:08:38.262 --> 00:08:39.251
No!

00:08:39.397 --> 00:08:40.864
Yoshiko!

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:44.365
What's the matter, Vice Principal?

00:08:44.902 --> 00:08:46.301
Golf practice?

00:08:46.704 --> 00:08:49.537
Oh, well, do I look good?

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:57.671
Onizuka is tutoring at your house?

00:08:57.782 --> 00:09:00.182
That's pretty weird, isn't it?

00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:02.415
It's a nightmare.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.683
Not only at school,
but even at home...

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.556
...that bully has invaded
my life like a germ.

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:13.129
Then you can't get any rest.

00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:17.657
A young man and a young woman
under one roof...

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:21.096
My daughter is not a problem.

00:09:21.405 --> 00:09:23.464
She's not stupid enough
to get involved with him.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:27.701
That belief is dangerous.

00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:29.409
What?

00:09:29.514 --> 00:09:33.006
People often say,
"My child is not a problem."

00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:37.178
Isn't it a problem
to trust one's own child too much?

00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:39.650
A secret lesson
without anyone's knowledge.

00:09:39.757 --> 00:09:41.554
My body is your textbook.

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:44.219
So let's repeat after me.

00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:49.322
Just kidding.
What? Vice Principal?

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:54.572
SHIMORENJAKU
GENERAL HOSPITAL
Take care.

00:09:54.572 --> 00:09:56.699
Again, stomach pain from stress.

00:09:57.542 --> 00:10:00.238
The doctor tells me to remove
the cause of my stress.

00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:03.078
If I could, I would have done it
a long time ago.

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:07.717
Hello, this is Uchiyamada.

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:11.654
What? Onizuka? Enjo-kosai?

00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:18.260
Sannomaru-sensei saw him walking
with a female student in a uniform...

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:22.196
...arm in arm
in the hotel district of Shibuya.

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:27.670
No, I don't mean to be a tattletale.

00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:30.466
I haven't confirmed it
with Onizuka yet.

00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:34.944
It was night,
and I'm not definitely sure...

00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:41.608
But if I don't say anything,
I'll feel guilty, too.

00:10:41.953 --> 00:10:45.480
I don't care about your situation.

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:48.625
I'm questioning if you saw it or not!

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.556
So I...

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.988
You saw it, right?

00:10:57.068 --> 00:10:58.126
Yes.

00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:06.640
I see.
Onizuka-sensei did.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.446
SUUITO HOUMU
(SWEET HOME)

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:14.040
Is that so? Onizuka-sensei did...

00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:17.210
He doesn't recognize his position
as an educator.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.081
He has been involved
in sexual conduct with girls.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.318
It's outrageous.

00:11:22.524 --> 00:11:24.788
He is not qualified to be a teacher.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.256
Principal. You have
to make your decision now!

00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:31.428
Where is Onizuka-sensei?

00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:34.061
We've been looking for him.
But we can't find him.

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:36.603
I guess he's afraid
his evil actions will become public.

00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:37.898
He must have escaped.

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:40.330
It sounds like him.

00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:41.870
Well, Principal...

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:46.370
But there is no proof.

00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:47.505
Proof?

00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:50.210
Anyone can say he saw something.

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:56.752
Isn't it a bit reckless to accuse him
without any proof?

00:11:56.991 --> 00:11:58.515
But...

00:11:59.127 --> 00:12:03.086
Well, I have a photograph
I took at that time.

00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:05.093
Good job, Yama-chan!

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.101
Why didn't you show it to her
in the beginning?

00:12:08.837 --> 00:12:12.671
I didn't mean to take it as proof.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:18.076
I happened to have a camera
with me, and I pressed the shutter.

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:21.148
This is...

00:12:21.549 --> 00:12:24.484
How about that?
That's really Onizuka.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.421
MY HAMUKO

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:28.888
MY HAMUKO
How cute!

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:31.582
Isn't she? It's my Hamuko...

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:33.160
Never mind.
Where is Onizuka's photo?

00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:34.353
My mistake.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.021
Here it is.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.126
How about that, Principal?

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:43.870
With this indisputable proof,
Onizuka can have no excuse...

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:55.209
Yo, Yo, Yoshiko!

00:12:57.452 --> 00:12:59.920
This really is Onizuka
with a female student.

00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:03.156
There's no excuse!
With such a pretty girl!

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:07.591
Really, he shouldn't be a teacher.

00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:12.826
Okay. Let's have an emergency
faculty meeting tomorrow morning.

00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:17.469
We'll decide Onizuka-sensei's future
in the meeting.

00:13:18.072 --> 00:13:20.370
Yoshiko! Is Yoshiko there?

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:25.611
No. She went to see Onizuka-sensei
to ask some questions.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.804
Where?

00:13:26.915 --> 00:13:28.815
She said they're going
to meet in Shibuya.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.649
Onizuka! That monkey!

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.150
Does he want to take
everything away from me?

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:43.697
School, happy home life,
and my precious jewel...

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:45.356
... my lovely daughter.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.628
I can't stand it anymore.
I'll kill you with my bare hands!

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.268
Don't say such stupid things.

00:13:53.474 --> 00:13:54.702
Do you like that?

00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:56.106
Yes!

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.303
Yoshiko!

00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:00.270
Where did they go?

00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:04.709
What's that place?

00:14:07.622 --> 00:14:10.921
You can't escape anymore.
Give up.

00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:13.559
No, please stop now.

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:18.462
It'll be heavenly.

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:21.968
I won't let it happen!
I'm coming, Yoshiko!

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.367
Yoshiko!

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.200
Welcome.

00:14:27.342 --> 00:14:31.369
Tonight we have a costume party.

00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:35.848
If you would like,
we can find something for you.

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.043
Where is Onizuka?
Where is that monkey?

00:14:38.152 --> 00:14:39.141
What?

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.119
That monkey!
Bring me that ape!

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:45.086
I see.
Please come this way.

00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:48.355
What's this?

00:14:48.563 --> 00:14:50.394
It's an ape.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:53.889
Don't play with me!

00:14:54.535 --> 00:14:55.661
Yoshiko!

00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:00.071
Yoshiko! Where are you?

00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:03.444
Yoshiko! Answer me!

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.444
MIYASHITA PARK

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.146
Where did you go?

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:09.807
Yoshiko!

00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:17.551
Who are you?

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:18.921
What are you going to do?

00:15:19.494 --> 00:15:22.224
I have to bring my daughter back.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.230
Don't stop me.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:12.743
You...you are going to destroy
what little happiness I have!

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.611
My family, my sweet home.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.343
Don't think I'm easy.

00:16:21.055 --> 00:16:25.253
I may be small,
but if you want to...

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.291
... then I'll fight you!

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:32.165
Even if I get killed!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:36.599
Come! You are the dogs
controlled by the state!

00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:40.901
I didn't survive
the '60s and '70s in vain.

00:16:41.342 --> 00:16:44.106
Watch me!

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:48.709
Ryoko! Yoshiko!
Give me a hand!

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:52.809
Give this powerless man
the power to protect you!

00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:56.821
Yoshiko!

00:17:11.773 --> 00:17:13.673
Okay. He's calmed down.

00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:15.833
What...?!

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.410
What's going on?!

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.843
What are they doing?
Those tax abusers!

00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:25.885
You're supposed to catch
Onizuka!

00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:30.022
I'm a head of the household.
I'm Vice Principal of Seirin Gakuen.

00:17:30.124 --> 00:17:34.060
What's the reason to catch me?

00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:38.722
I'm naked?!

00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:43.797
VICE PRINCIPAL
FOUND STREAKING

00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:47.102
Some shocking news!
Police arrested a naked...

00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:49.904
...school vice principal
in Shibuya.

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.414
Pervert teacher!

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:56.043
Go away!

00:17:57.552 --> 00:18:01.249
I can't stand this anymore.
Damn you!

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:04.085
You should die!

00:18:08.062 --> 00:18:13.625
I can't get caught
before I get my daughter back.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.430
What are you doing,
Vice Principal?

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.469
Onizuka!

00:18:22.777 --> 00:18:26.713
Streaking?
It's not popular anymore.

00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:29.744
Never mind.
Where is Yoshiko?

00:18:35.423 --> 00:18:37.254
Yoshiko. You're safe.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.293
Onizuka-sensei.

00:18:40.761 --> 00:18:42.023
Where are you?

00:18:42.129 --> 00:18:43.494
I'm here.

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.893
You're still wearing
your raincoat?

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.232
Yeah.
I guess it stopped raining.

00:18:50.438 --> 00:18:53.874
So how was it?
It was your favorite, wasn't it?

00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:56.600
It was the best!
It was sensational!

00:18:57.311 --> 00:19:00.508
Sensational?
I was not in time?!

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:03.547
Then what I can do is...!

00:19:07.822 --> 00:19:10.620
So could you take me here again?
To the live show?

00:19:10.992 --> 00:19:13.324
Live show?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.720
I'm embarrassed
to come here alone...

00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:18.458
... in the middle
of the hotel district.

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:20.659
Isn't it more embarrassing
for two?

00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:21.735
No way.

00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:28.033
Then that photo was taken
when she came to the live show...

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:32.401
Oh, look at the time.
My father is strict.

00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:35.548
He doesn't trust his own child.
Oh, well.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.878
What happened to your coat?

00:19:36.984 --> 00:19:38.008
I don't need it if it's not raining.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:39.143
What a waste!

00:19:39.253 --> 00:19:40.811
That's okay.

00:19:47.295 --> 00:19:50.093
Vice Principal,
please don't get caught.

00:19:57.939 --> 00:20:00.533
Principal! I beg you!

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:04.836
Please cancel today's
emergency faculty meeting.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.546
Why?

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:11.411
Onizuka-sensei is needed
at this school.

00:20:12.453 --> 00:20:15.854
He loves students,
and he loves teaching.

00:20:15.957 --> 00:20:20.018
There is no way he could do
such a sleazy thing as Enjo-kosai.

00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:23.892
I believe in Onizuka-sensei.
I want to place my trust in him.

00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:28.695
I understand.
Let's cancel the meeting.

00:20:29.203 --> 00:20:34.971
I'm very happy to know
that you trust him that much.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:41.407
Let's keep working
towards building an ideal school.

00:20:42.249 --> 00:20:43.273
Yes.

00:20:45.219 --> 00:20:47.312
My name is Hiroshi Uchiyamada.

00:20:47.488 --> 00:20:49.888
I'm a baby-boomer.

00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:54.189
Sometimes I have to do things
I don't want to do.

00:20:55.496 --> 00:20:57.964
Not bad.

00:20:58.265 --> 00:21:00.324
It's too good to paint over.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:03.335
But we can't keep it, either.

00:21:03.604 --> 00:21:06.539
Why don't we take a picture of it
before repainting?

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:09.735
Everyone!

00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:13.905
Thank you for waiting
for the additional paint!

00:21:23.224 --> 00:21:25.055
Vice Principal.
Are you okay?

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:26.319
I'm sorry.

00:21:26.427 --> 00:21:27.792
We have to wipe it off!

00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:31.255
Not blow it off!

00:21:47.768 --> 00:21:52.501
You can't love everyone

00:21:52.672 --> 00:21:55.732
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.009 --> 00:21:59.911
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.279
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.286 --> 00:22:09.881
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.157 --> 00:22:14.093
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.361 --> 00:22:22.234
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:22.502 --> 00:22:27.030
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:32.302
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:32.546 --> 00:22:36.539
What is there for me to do?

00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:40.583
It may be small now

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:44.746
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:44.991 --> 00:22:48.586
A tear is about to drop

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:52.865
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:56.728
Live strong every moment

00:22:56.937 --> 00:23:02.603
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:16.389 --> 00:23:17.151
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:17.224 --> 00:23:20.125
NEXT EPISODE
Where is the faculty room?

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.887
NEXT EPISODE
I'm Nao Kadena.

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:24.724
I'm going to work at the infirmary
of this school starting today.

00:23:24.831 --> 00:23:26.264
Call me Nao-chan.

00:23:26.566 --> 00:23:27.590
Nao-chan?

00:23:27.734 --> 00:23:29.395
My measurements are...

00:23:29.502 --> 00:23:31.265
...secret!

00:23:31.371 --> 00:23:34.397
Tell me the truth!

00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:37.635
Nao-chan said
if we get to the top 50...

00:23:37.744 --> 00:23:40.577
...she would teach us what it's like
to be with an adult woman.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.908
What?!

00:23:42.082 --> 00:23:46.314
If you get to the top 50,
I can go out with you.

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:54.258
SEE YA NEXT TIME
