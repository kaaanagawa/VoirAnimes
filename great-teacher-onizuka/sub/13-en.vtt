WEBVTT

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:20.760
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:27.071
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.141
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.877
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:43.650
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:48.620
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:54.695
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:54.998 --> 00:01:00.492
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:03.631
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:07.832
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.045
Toward the finish line

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:44.731
Teacher, you're frowning.
Does it still hurt?

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:46.576
I'm O.K.

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:52.875
Take care of yourself
because you're mine.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.555
Oh, no!
What happened, Teshigawara-sensei?

00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:06.159
Those bandages!

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:10.991
It's not a big deal. I fell
on the stairs at a train station.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.302
Are you really all right?
It looks like it really hurts.

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:18.369
No, don't worry.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:22.838
The only inconvenience is
that I can't cook for myself.

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:27.145
-Then shall I cook for you?
-Could you?

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:30.839
It's a token of appreciation
for the computer.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:35.145
What would you like?
But I can't cook anything elaborate.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.586
No problem. As long as I can
eat your homemade cooking.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.487
Then I'll come over tonight.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:49.058
Wonderful. Azusa is coming
to my place to cook dinner for me!

00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:53.561
My world is becoming perfect finally!

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:58.372
She will probably bring her apron.
The blue one!

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.474
Blue looks great on her!

00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:06.911
I will welcome her with the best wine.
'80 Chambertin would be perfect.

00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:12.713
She will wear her blue apron
and carry dishes to the table.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:16.220
I will pretend that
I'm helping her and....

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.587
Cheers!

00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:33.129
You're beautiful, Azusa!

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:37.640
That's right. My sweet illusion
will soon become reality.

00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:40.072
The world that belongs
to me and Azusa.

00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:45.182
Then the only thing left to do is
to get rid of that idiot Onizuka!

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:48.751
I will eliminate him from our school!

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.122
Hello, this is Teshigawara. Yes.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.987
I see. I'll be waiting.

00:03:58.197 --> 00:03:59.459
Here they come.

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:16.534
I would like to see
the Vice Principal.

00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:21.816
I'm Ota, president of the Society
of the Study...

00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:25.953
...of Victimization in Education.
We'd like to observe a class.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.690
Observe?
You mean, Onizuka-sensei's class?

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:43.300
Yes. I heard rumors that...

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:47.439
...there's an outrageous,
juvenile-delinquent teacher here.

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:51.165
I heard he has never done
any serious teaching.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.902
There shouldn't be any teachers
like that in our school.

00:04:55.148 --> 00:05:01.450
We actually received complaints
at our organization!

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:07.022
As representatives of parents, we need
to investigate what is taking place.

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.557
This is the classroom, isn't it?

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:19.362
Elephant, elephant

00:05:19.603 --> 00:05:23.129
Let's take a shower

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:35.143
Huh? Is that old lady
someone's mother?

00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:41.783
Onizuka-kun! What have you done?

00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:45.550
I'm so sorry! There are
complicated reasons for this.

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:49.627
Onizuka-kun, you apologize too!

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:51.958
Ota-san?

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:54.830
There's a problem!

00:05:55.068 --> 00:06:00.335
What's wrong, Mr. Sanomaru?
What happened? Calm down.

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:04.270
A pressure group, called
Society something, came...

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.005
...and Onizuka-sensei made the president
so mad that she fainted!

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:11.216
Interview Room

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.610
This is a big problem!

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:17.879
We will pursue this case
and impeach him. Be prepared!

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:24.989
-Are you all right, president?
-He's absolutely outrageous!

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.595
What an idiot to have
an elephant outfit!

00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.298
Elephant?

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:32.433
Do you intend to shut down our school?

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:35.967
She belongs to
a famous pressure group.

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:40.835
She's the president! Her husband is
a Tokyo municipal assemblyman.

00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:45.638
You were in an indecent outfit in
front of her! Oh, my blood pressure.

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:49.342
-Are you O.K.?
-I don't need your sympathy!

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:54.816
I have absolutely no idea why
the Principal is keeping such an idiot!

00:06:55.322 --> 00:07:01.386
Wait a minute! I'm sure Onizuka-sensei
has his own ideas about education.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.222
Maybe you could listen
to his side of--

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:09.663
Fuyutsuki-sensei, keep quiet! This idiot
thinks light of a teacher's position.

00:07:09.903 --> 00:07:13.998
A school is not a place to play!
It's a place to teach!

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:16.969
-What's wrong with playing?
-What?

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:21.805
When I was in junior high,
I played around 24 hours a day.

00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.809
I don't want to hear about you!

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:28.815
A student's future is determined by
his junior high and high school years.

00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:32.887
Whether you can enter
a good university, a good company...

00:07:33.124 --> 00:07:36.092
...and a good career depends
only on these 6 years!

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.151
What you're saying sounds
old-fashioned.

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.559
Nowadays, huge corporations
are filing for bankruptcy.

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:46.427
I think the six years during
junior high and high school...

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.502
...are more important
than decades in your old age.

00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:50.762
What?

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:53.701
Instead of entering
a good university...

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:58.436
...finding good friends seems
to be much more worthwhile to me.

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.541
Don't talk like a smart ass,
you idiot!

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:06.981
After doing so much damage,
you're telling me what you think?

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.688
You're still on a trial basis--

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.948
Watch out!

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.056
Are you all right?

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.263
My nose, my nose!

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:24.495
Onizuka-sensei, look what you've done
to him! You're just unbelievable!

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:26.203
Get a first aid kit!

00:08:26.438 --> 00:08:32.468
Oh, come on, it was an accident.
I was just standing up.

00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:37.875
You liar! I know you're good
at performing an act of violence...

00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:40.515
...as if it accidentally happened.

00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:43.515
Do you want to go to the police?

00:08:43.754 --> 00:08:46.586
Look at my nose.
This will be an assault case.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.549
I told you, I didn't do anything.

00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:56.654
It's all your fault!
What's with the elephant trumpet?

00:08:56.898 --> 00:08:59.662
This is the end of your career!

00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:04.963
You're the local administrator.
If I'm forced to leave, I will starve!

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:08.607
Please have pity and pardon me.

00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:11.835
You're still making jokes!
I won't forgive you!

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:15.070
I'll sue you. I'll sue you.
I'll sue you!

00:09:15.315 --> 00:09:19.615
-I told you I didn't do anything!
-Shut up! You certainly did!

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:23.789
You still say so?
I didn't. I didn't. I didn't!

00:09:24.024 --> 00:09:28.790
If you keep nagging me, I'll crack open
your head and stir up your brain.

00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:31.258
Baldy! Do you understand?

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:41.195
You'll be fine. You didn't really use
excessive force. You're innocent!

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:43.581
But the Vice Principal's eyes
were rolled back.

00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:50.612
He must have been shocked
because your voice was so loud.

00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:53.611
It's O.K.
You don't have to console me.

00:09:54.418 --> 00:09:58.319
I should have known.
Maybe I'm not suited to be a teacher.

00:09:58.954 --> 00:10:03.288
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna go buy a job magazine.

00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:04.891
Onizuka-sensei.

00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:09.864
A guy who wears an elephant costume
can't be a qualified teacher.

00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:14.535
You'll see. Getting fired is
not enough for Onizuka...

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:17.828
...because he insulted
not only me, but you.

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:21.033
What are you going to do?

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:26.837
Make sure he's socially eliminated
so he can never become a teacher.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.847
That's just what
one would expect of you.

00:10:31.084 --> 00:10:33.814
I will make arrangements
to assist you.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.287
I'm home.

00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:39.349
Welcome home, Hidemi-chan.
Teshigawara-sensei is here.

00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:47.186
-What's wrong? You're smiling.
-Oh, nothing.

00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:50.992
When you were talking with my mom,
you looked cheerful too.

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.294
Did anything good happen?

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:55.266
There's nothing.

00:10:55.506 --> 00:11:01.671
Remember our promise? We don't
hide anything from each other.

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:07.771
-Wait, Hidemi-chan.
-Yes, hello.

00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:12.578
Hello? Isn't this
Teshigawara-sensei's phone number?

00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:16.552
I'm the one
Teshigawara-sensei is tutoring.

00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:19.589
He can't come to the phone right now.

00:11:19.827 --> 00:11:24.093
Really? Then could you
give him a message?

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:29.929
I'm Fuyutsuki. I was supposed
to go to his place tonight...

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.604
...but I don't think I can make it--

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:35.831
Hello, I'm Onizuka. Onizuka!

00:11:36.076 --> 00:11:40.808
-Hey, Onizuka-sensei. Be quiet!
-I'm Onizuka. Please vote for me!

00:11:41.046 --> 00:11:46.143
Shoot! Anyway, if you could
give him the message....

00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:49.319
Come on! Stop it!

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.683
Fuyutsuki can't make it tonight.

00:11:52.924 --> 00:11:54.357
Oh, no!

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:58.417
No wonder you've been in a good mood.

00:11:58.662 --> 00:12:03.656
You were going to have a woman cook
for you without telling me.

00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:06.836
I wonder what Fuyutsuki-sensei is like?

00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:09.267
That's....

00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:21.278
It's a punishment. Lick it, as usual.

00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:24.079
You don't want to?

00:12:24.553 --> 00:12:30.320
I know that you just want to take
advantage of my high-class parents.

00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:35.257
Otherwise, you wouldn't do
what I tell you to.

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:37.855
I don't care.

00:12:38.097 --> 00:12:43.330
I will still play the role
of a queen for your sake.

00:12:55.151 --> 00:13:00.610
I'm so sorry, Fuyutsuki-chan. This
happens when he has too much to drink.

00:13:00.855 --> 00:13:04.790
He can't drink much, but he
forced himself. Isn't he dumb?

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:07.151
What did you say, Ryuji?
Who's dumb?

00:13:07.393 --> 00:13:09.326
You. It's not normal...

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.256
...to use an elephant to do
a cosplay and squirt water.

00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:15.726
A swan by Shimura is better!

00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:21.329
You butthead! You're saying whatever
you like to someone who is down!

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:24.399
I'll repeat myself
as many times as you want.

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:29.765
You're not suited to be a teacher.
You were destined to be fired.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.299
You bastard.
Don't you be mouthing off.

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:36.908
My amazing fists will explode!

00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:41.705
You bastard! You, you, you....

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.211
Onizuka-sensei!

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.942
Honestly, I still can't believe
this guy is a teacher.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.814
I can't believe it.

00:13:56.056 --> 00:14:00.651
But I am a little envious
of the students in his class.

00:14:00.892 --> 00:14:04.258
We were bored at school.

00:14:04.494 --> 00:14:06.893
We were looked down on.

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:09.892
Teachers were cold
toward stupid students.

00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:11.757
That's not true.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:15.399
I wondered if those teachers
were so wonderful...

00:14:15.635 --> 00:14:18.899
...that they had the right
to look down on us.

00:14:19.137 --> 00:14:23.162
Eikichi's not smart, but I can
honestly say he is amazing.

00:14:23.406 --> 00:14:26.738
I get this feeling that
he'll accomplish something.

00:14:26.975 --> 00:14:31.933
I understand what you mean! I look
forward to going to school every day!

00:14:32.812 --> 00:14:34.837
That's what I envy.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.516
If a guy like him is your teacher,
school can't be boring.

00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:45.549
Private Onizuka will manage
to bring back dinner!

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.754
Wait! Hey!

00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:53.519
I caught one, sergeant!

00:14:53.758 --> 00:14:56.783
Just shut up and get out of there!

00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:59.051
The carp is escaping!

00:14:59.295 --> 00:15:02.058
Fun at school, he said.

00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:06.255
I really want Onizuka-sensei
to remain a teacher...

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:09.224
...forever.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.065
Repentance

00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:18.637
You really think it will be O.K.?
Looking like this?

00:15:18.874 --> 00:15:20.932
What counts most is your heart.

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:24.870
If you apologize sincerely,
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:27.840
-Fuyutsuki-sensei!
-Teshigawara-sensei!

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.811
I'm sorry I canceled
our plans last night.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.745
No problem. By the way....

00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:39.183
Interview Room

00:15:39.387 --> 00:15:40.354
On hold?

00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:44.386
Right. A little earlier
President Ota came by...

00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:48.580
...and we decided to put your layoff
on hold as a special case.

00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:53.817
-I'm happy for you! You're not fired!
-Are you serious? Lucky!

00:15:54.229 --> 00:15:59.221
-However, there is one condition.
-Condition?

00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:02.262
He needs to take a test.

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:08.529
The Tobunsha Nationwide Standardized
Academic Test, known as Togaku.

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:10.503
What is it?

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:14.697
Don't you know? It's a trial exam
junior high students take.

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:19.138
That's right. We want him
to take the test with the students.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:24.109
Then you need the highest
national score to be able to stay.

00:16:24.348 --> 00:16:26.076
Highest nationally?

00:16:26.315 --> 00:16:29.215
Impossible. It's a high school
entrance exam...

00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:32.010
...but his non-major subjects
will be hard.

00:16:32.253 --> 00:16:36.984
You're in a position where you can't
complain even if you were fired.

00:16:37.222 --> 00:16:40.019
But thanks to the generosity
of Ota-san...

00:16:40.258 --> 00:16:44.920
...from the Society of the Study
of Victimization in Education...

00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:46.718
...you were given a chance.

00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:50.919
If you don't want to take the test
and make a fool of yourself...

00:16:51.165 --> 00:16:52.893
...go ahead and resign.

00:16:53.132 --> 00:16:57.123
But if you insist that
you're not a flaky teacher...

00:16:57.368 --> 00:17:03.305
...score highest nationally
and prove your ability, Onizuka-sensei.

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:05.836
Very well.
I will meet the challenge.

00:17:06.073 --> 00:17:07.596
Onizuka-sensei!

00:17:07.841 --> 00:17:10.104
It's just a test for students.

00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:15.937
I'll score the highest and prove that
I'm not a teacher just for show.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.911
It wouldn't be good if a teacher
is stupider than his students.

00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:22.741
Are you really motivated?

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.084
You've only scored
49 points out of 500.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.412
The previous top student
scored 492 points!

00:17:29.888 --> 00:17:32.788
You might as well strive
for the lowest score.

00:17:33.024 --> 00:17:36.389
I can't believe it!
I thought I did so well.

00:17:37.293 --> 00:17:38.817
He's helpless.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.028
Holy Forest Academy

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:44.422
I can't do it.

00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:49.066
I haven't really studied
for the last 22 years.

00:17:52.635 --> 00:17:56.502
-How do you do, Onizuka-sensei?
-Who are you?

00:17:57.005 --> 00:17:58.232
I'm Hidemi Ota.

00:17:58.473 --> 00:18:04.205
Remember the president that you
showered in the face? I'm her daughter.

00:18:04.443 --> 00:18:07.639
That wench?
I mean, sophisticated lady!

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:12.371
I've heard about what happened.
Things seem to be getting tougher.

00:18:12.615 --> 00:18:17.346
Talking about getting laid off and
this test have been stressing me out.

00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:22.282
If you like, I might ask my mother....

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.221
So, what are you going
to ask your mother?

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:34.120
I could ask her to forget about
everything that happened today.

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:35.692
Could you really?

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:39.522
I'm sure it'll work.
My mom is so lenient with me.

00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:44.257
Also, my dad, an assemblyman,
will do anything I ask him to.

00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:49.096
What a relief! Everything started
with a misunderstanding.

00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:52.238
So if you could explain
to your mother....

00:18:52.472 --> 00:18:54.996
But I have one condition.

00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:57.674
Of course!

00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:09.641
I want you to lick my foot.

00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:14.342
If you become my pet,
I'll make sure you don't get fired.

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:18.612
Go under the table
and lick it really clean.

00:19:20.323 --> 00:19:22.756
Men are all stupid.

00:19:22.992 --> 00:19:27.893
If I show off my parents' social
status, they wag their tails.

00:19:28.128 --> 00:19:32.460
This guy is the same too.
He'll do whatever I ask.

00:19:34.332 --> 00:19:39.926
It stinks! Hey, what are you doing?
Do you wanna get fired?

00:19:40.168 --> 00:19:42.328
My dad is an assemblyman!

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.333
So what?

00:19:44.572 --> 00:19:48.631
I can't believe it!
I had no idea what she had in mind.

00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:52.240
"Lick my foot"? Give me a break!
That blue-butt brat.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.075
Here is the punishment.

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.772
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:19:58.014 --> 00:20:01.812
I don't care
if your daddy is an assemblyman.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:09.245
What I hate most is a brat like you
who mouths off to grownups.

00:20:10.087 --> 00:20:12.748
Never mouth off to grownups.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.757
Don't be stupid, you dumb teacher.

00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:19.356
If I don't do a favor for you,
you'll get fired!

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:22.925
That's what I want, you wench.

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:35.199
There is no way that Onizuka
will score highest nationally.

00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:37.733
He might score lowest.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.565
If his shameful failure
is exposed to the media...

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:45.071
...he'll never be able
to find a teaching job.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.174
All is as planned.

00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:52.108
You klutz! Lick more thoroughly!
I have to tell you that all the time!

00:20:52.714 --> 00:20:56.876
Why are you looking at me like that?
You're nothing but a pet!

00:20:57.717 --> 00:21:03.710
Do you wanna hear something funny?
I went to your school today.

00:21:03.954 --> 00:21:06.252
-What?
-I met Onizuka too.

00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:08.955
What did you do?
What did you tell him?

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.683
Shut up! Who does he think he is,
that bastard? He spanked me.

00:21:13.927 --> 00:21:17.827
Not even my dad and mom
have ever spanked me!

00:21:18.063 --> 00:21:19.121
What?

00:21:19.364 --> 00:21:22.991
I'll never forgive him,
that monkey teacher!

00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:27.099
I will make him my pet
and force him to lick my feet.

00:21:27.335 --> 00:21:30.327
Just like you, Teshigawara.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.574
You and me, let's go away

00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:50.808
To look for new emotions today

00:21:51.053 --> 00:21:55.854
Together we can overcome

00:21:56.125 --> 00:22:01.791
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:22:02.064 --> 00:22:06.194
Open your eyes and open the door

00:22:07.003 --> 00:22:11.406
The world in front of your eyes

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:17.009
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:22:17.413 --> 00:22:21.611
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:32.419
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:42.427
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:22:42.638 --> 00:22:46.836
I want to see you, but I can't

00:22:47.109 --> 00:22:51.910
So I just embrace my love

00:22:52.214 --> 00:22:57.015
Even walking on a crowded street

00:22:57.286 --> 00:23:03.589
Your smile makes my head spin

00:23:14.437 --> 00:23:15.301
Next Episode

00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:17.802
It's no use. You'll be fired anyway.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.974
I'll kill you if it's not true!

00:23:20.209 --> 00:23:21.972
It's not living together!

00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:26.113
You guys are stupid. Did you think
you could get away with it?

00:23:27.216 --> 00:23:29.081
Don't interfere in my business!
