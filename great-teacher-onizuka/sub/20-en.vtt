WEBVTT

00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:11.465
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:16.558
I don't just feel it

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:23.366
This street makes me love

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.135
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:32.274
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:37.613
Cars don't look they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:42.924
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:48.491
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:54.134
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:54.971 --> 00:01:00.341
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:05.708
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:10.876
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:18.756
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.328
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:26.129
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:45.807
We're betting 1,000 yen.
We definitely can't lose this game!

00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:53.869
Ambush!
Don't mess with Sergeant Saunders.

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.465
Kuji, what are you looking at?

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.538
Oh, no. Nothing.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.938
Well, Onizuka is goofing off
with them again.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:12.872
Come to think of it, I've heard
a rumor that you like Murai a lot.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:13.971
Really?

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.151
It's just a rumor...

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.689
That's for sure.

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:25.285
He's got to be much taller
to be with you, Kuji.

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:28.353
I didn't mean
you're big or anything...

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.332
Sounds like you meant it that way.
Don't you think, Kuji?

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:36.802
You..!

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.340
You need another 10 years
to catch up with me. Come on.

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.304
They are so stupid.

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:46.206
Crap!

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:52.586
Man, I wish
we didn't lose the game...

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:54.656
But we can't goof off forever...

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:58.318
...otherwise we'll be like him.
No girlfriend for 22 years.

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.793
I want to avoid that!

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:05.795
I want a girlfriend soon.
What's this?

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.236
What are you doing
with that letter?

00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:10.771
Hey, hey, hey. It may be...

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.676
Oh, wow! This is a love letter.
A love letter!

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:16.905
Give it back to me!

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.037
Who is it from?

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:22.382
How do I know?
Give it back to me!

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.783
Can't breathe..!

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.183
We're friends, aren't we?
Let us see it.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:28.382
Shut up!

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.551
"Dear Kunio Murai, I am writing you
for the first time..."

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.494
Onizuka!

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:36.225
You!
When did you take it from me?

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.463
Well, well, well.
This is what I call a love letter!

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:44.905
I can smell something nice...
so lovely...

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.340
Don't look at it!
And don't smell it!

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.502
FROM "F" IN CLASS 2

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.705
Who does this initial "F,"
from Class 2, belong to?

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.511
Let's see.
A girl with the initial "F"...

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.142
Keiko Fujikura.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.381
She has a boyfriend.

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.980
"F," "F"... Megumi Fukuyama.

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:06.321
She stopped coming to school
a long time ago.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.492
Fujita!

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.231
No way.
Akane Fujita was voted as...

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:15.770
...one of the three cutest girls
at the prom last year.

00:04:15.872 --> 00:04:18.067
That girl? I voted for her, too!

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.443
What are you talking about?
She likes me? It'll never happen.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.011
Coming from Class 2, it could be
from a freshman or a junior.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.651
You're blushing even as you speak.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:34.756
Here you go.

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:40.992
Akane...

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.793
Oh, no. Akane.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:47.796
Sooorry.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:51.763
I want to protect her.

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:55.908
I can't believe she likes me.

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:01.273
Do you want me to ask her?

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:03.677
Idiot. Stop it! She may not like me.

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:05.482
Or she may, Murai.

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:11.926
What's with the costume?

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:13.791
He's going to be a matchmaker.

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:14.852
Matchmaker?

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.199
My student's got a girlfriend.

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.896
I'm the teacher,
I can't just leave it like this.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:27.032
Just count on me.
Everything will be all right.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.904
Akane Fujita!

00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.906
Hey. Yoo-hoo! Over here.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.540
He's an immoral guy,
but I want to introduce him to you!

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:34.878
NICE TO MEET YOU
(Nyce ta meet ya)

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:36.748
Not immoral, but imperfect!

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:39.155
It's none of your business.

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:41.680
Do something for yourself
if you have so much time.

00:05:41.757 --> 00:05:44.817
No wonder you haven't had
a girlfriend for 22 years.

00:05:45.127 --> 00:05:48.392
How could you say
that to me, huh?!

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.932
Akane!
I can give you some advice.

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.766
Nothing good will come
from dating him.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:06:00.070
It's a secret,
but he has a mother complex.

00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:02.975
Shit. How can you call yourself
a matchmaker?

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:05.545
Shut up! You're too young
to go out with a girl...

00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:07.410
...before your teacher
has a girlfriend!

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:09.982
What's that?

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:11.849
I don't know.

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:15.517
I guess she's not the one.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.024
So who is it?

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:20.494
Damn, everything
is Onizuka's fault.

00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:21.860
Murai...

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.896
Oh, Kujirakawa. What's up?

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.195
She's huge. Who is she?

00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:33.503
She's Kujirakawa,
the legend from Class 2.

00:06:34.276 --> 00:06:35.834
Haven't you read the letter?

00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:37.242
What? Letter?

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.410
Kujirakawa is the "F"?

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:43.114
Don't get me wrong. It's not me.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:45.444
I'm just helping.

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:47.283
Got a minute?

00:06:47.823 --> 00:06:49.222
Oh, yeah.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.493
What did you think of the letter?

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:59.334
Be serious.
She's waiting for your answer.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.368
But I have no idea
who this "F" is.

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:06.732
Can't you tell me who she is?

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:10.608
It doesn't matter.
It's about how you feel.

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:14.041
You don't know whether you
would like her or not, isn't that it?

00:07:14.116 --> 00:07:15.777
After that kind of letter.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.820
But who is the girl?

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.289
I'll tell you her name
if you tell me how you feel.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:24.986
That's not fair.
Hey, Kujirakawa.

00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:27.794
Can't you make up your mind, man?

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.166
Whatever.
Wait, Kujirakawa.

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:35.269
Why did you go down there?

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:41.867
Doesn't matter. Well, think about it.
I'll ask you again later.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.706
Hey, Kujirakawa!

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:47.215
Why is she like that?

00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:57.148
Kuji!

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.826
Go, Kuji!

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.727
Wow!
Kujirakawa's made a dunk shot.

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:11.166
She's 5'10" and weighs 150 pounds.

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:15.634
She is so athletic
that a few schools are scouting her.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:21.710
But she turns down all offers.
She belongs to a Manga club here.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:26.018
Manga? What's up with that?
She's weird.

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:32.622
Come to think of it, Kujirakawa's first
name starts with "F" for Fuyumi.

00:08:33.963 --> 00:08:36.488
Do you remember?
When we were freshmen...

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:41.696
...some guys in her class
were teasing her at the entrance.

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:43.098
Despite her size...

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:46.164
...she wouldn't fight back,
she just cried.

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:51.976
Huge! She's a freshman
and wears a size 10!

00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:55.474
Here's a kick
from the Giant Kujirakawa!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.381
I've never seen a shoe this big.

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:08.129
Don't be so brutal.
Give them back to her!

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:09.553
What?

00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:11.131
Who is he?

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:19.432
Now I remember!
After all, they beat up Murai.

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:20.566
Shut up!

00:09:21.443 --> 00:09:25.846
Since then, I heard a rumor
that Kujirakawa likes you.

00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:28.917
That's an old story.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.653
But it could be she's the one
who wrote the letter.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.921
I guess it's impossible.

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:44.464
The famous giant's been thinking
about you for two years.

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:48.096
Just kidding.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.607
That's scary.
She's popular among the girls.

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:56.337
But most guys are scared away
because she's so big.

00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:04.181
AH! PRINCE WILLIAM...

00:10:11.327 --> 00:10:13.454
Who is "F"?

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:17.529
Akane!

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:19.901
It's a joke.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:21.666
Onizuka!

00:10:21.737 --> 00:10:23.932
- So, what's going on?
- What?

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:29.638
I mean, haven't you gone
on a date yet? And then...

00:10:29.778 --> 00:10:33.646
What are you thinking? Pervert!

00:10:33.782 --> 00:10:38.481
Hey. It's between you and your
teacher. Tell me something...

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:44.317
...or I'll tell your mom
you're messing around with a girl.

00:10:44.627 --> 00:10:47.596
Messing around with a girl?

00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:52.362
Let me tell you, if you get close
to my mom again, I'll kill you.

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:02.770
There you are, Murai.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.442
So what's your answer?
Do you think you could like her?

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:14.049
Are you still thinking?
You're such an indecisive guy!

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.323
Why can't you tell me her name?

00:11:17.726 --> 00:11:21.287
Without her name,
how can I give you an answer?

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:23.126
Isn't that reasonable?

00:11:23.232 --> 00:11:27.999
It's because she'll be hurt
if she's rejected...

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:32.406
... if you like someone else. Right?

00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:35.771
All the girls are like that.

00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:38.711
No confidence
towards boys they like.

00:11:39.014 --> 00:11:43.144
But I'm sure you'll like her. So?

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:45.115
That's enough, Kujirakawa.

00:11:45.654 --> 00:11:47.315
Fuyumi Kujirakawa.

00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:51.054
It's cool that someone
named "F" likes me...

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.152
... but I already like someone else.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.090
I think I like Akane Fujita.

00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:05.903
Oh, I see. Is that right?

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:09.377
That's cool for both of you, then.

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:11.542
What do you mean?

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:16.984
I told you before.
I was just asked to help her.

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:19.213
Don't get me wrong.

00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:24.021
So, that "F" is Akane?!

00:12:24.426 --> 00:12:27.486
No way!
How could I believe...

00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:30.589
...that one of the most popular girls
in the school...

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.863
...confessed her love
to someone like me with a letter.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.905
But that was her.
Am I dreaming or what?

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.201
No, it's not a dream!
It's true that she likes me!

00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.208
Man. That's so cool.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:48.238
That's it. Murai likes Akane, too.

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:51.151
- Kujirakawa?
- What?

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:54.286
I'll tell her now face to face.

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:57.416
Could you tell her I want
to meet her at the boat launch...

00:12:57.493 --> 00:12:59.484
... in Inogashira Park at 4 o'clock?

00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:01.256
Okay. I'll tell her.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.490
All right.

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:05.160
Kujirakawa?

00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:10.000
How did you find out I was here?

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.775
Because...you're always here...

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.869
...when you're thinking
about something.

00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:17.437
Oh, yeah?

00:13:18.247 --> 00:13:21.080
Anyway, I'm counting on you,
Kujirakawa.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.776
Yeah!

00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:28.915
I see. They liked each other.

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:32.192
I'm so stupid.

00:13:34.863 --> 00:13:36.387
What? Murai?

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.924
He wants to tell you how he feels.

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:41.469
I'm sure everything will go well.
Good for you!

00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:42.561
I guess...

00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:43.696
What's going on?

00:13:43.772 --> 00:13:44.830
Oh, nothing.

00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:52.144
I told you. Don't call me anymore.

00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:59.184
Have fun with your new girlfriend.
I'm going on a date now. Bye!

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:01.119
Who is it?

00:14:01.523 --> 00:14:03.718
That's my ex, Hide.

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.352
He still calls me
even though we broke up.

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.726
You really broke up with him,
didn't you?

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:13.367
He had another girlfriend
while he was dating me.

00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:16.266
I was so mad.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:20.173
Kuji, will you listen to me? He...

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:23.403
Why do you care about the guy
you've already broken up with?

00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:25.208
You like Murai now, right?

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:26.813
I mean...

00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:27.906
Akane!

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.284
Finally the time has come.

00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:35.152
It's time to end my 15-year history
without a girlfriend.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:37.920
Stop it! Leave me alone!

00:14:38.427 --> 00:14:40.054
I don't like it!

00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:41.196
That guy..!

00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:44.524
What are you doing?
Leave her alone!

00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:48.664
What? Who is he?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.931
He's Murai, the one
I was talking about.

00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:55.676
The date you're talking about
is this geek?

00:14:55.744 --> 00:14:57.439
You've got to be kidding!

00:14:58.347 --> 00:14:59.609
What did you say?

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:04.843
Don't start, Murai.
Hide was a boxer in high school.

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:06.215
So what?

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:10.057
That was a warning.

00:15:10.225 --> 00:15:16.391
You can't handle this spacey
and selfish chick.

00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:20.301
I'm not like that.

00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:23.595
I don't know who you are...

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.664
...but I can't stand anyone
who insults her.

00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:31.869
Back off, kid!

00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:34.415
Shoot! We lost him.

00:15:34.483 --> 00:15:36.041
- Hey. That's...
- What?

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:37.550
Could it be...

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:38.942
Kujirakawa?

00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:40.554
What is she doing?

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.117
Hide, you're brutal!

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.354
- It's your fault!
- Me?

00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:48.587
You didn't listen to me.

00:15:48.664 --> 00:15:51.565
You misunderstood me
and told me you wanted to break up.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:52.959
So...

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:54.827
Yes, you did.

00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:59.933
I never went out
with another chick, silly!

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.802
Really? You mean that?
Hideeeeee!

00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:05.140
Akane...

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.272
Murai!

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.174
Murai!

00:16:11.153 --> 00:16:12.711
Akane, what's going on?

00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:14.585
Who's this tall girl?

00:16:14.656 --> 00:16:16.487
This must be your ex!

00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:19.955
It's not his fault. I was stupid.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:24.756
I... I... I love Hide, no matter what!

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:29.129
That's enough. Let's go.

00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:31.803
Hey, Akane!

00:16:35.377 --> 00:16:40.178
I thought it was too good
to be true that Akane liked me...

00:16:40.415 --> 00:16:44.943
But I got so excited.
What a fool I am!

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:49.554
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
what was going on.

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:53.521
You don't need to apologize.
It doesn't matter now.

00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:55.220
Are you okay?

00:16:55.297 --> 00:16:56.389
Leave me alone.

00:16:56.465 --> 00:16:58.524
I said leave me alone!

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.962
That's not like you.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.106
Shut up! You don't know how I feel.

00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:08.507
It's none of your business.
You're too nosy!

00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:10.345
Sorry...

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.450
Wait, Murai. Don't be foolish
just because you lost a girl.

00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:22.853
Let me go!

00:17:22.924 --> 00:17:26.087
First of all, you can't kill yourself
by jumping into a pond.

00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:30.660
Idiot! I'm not gonna kill myself
until I kill that jerk.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.034
Oh, no! Onizuka and Murai's mom.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.041
People would think
we make a lovely couple.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.307
I've always wanted to ride a boat
like this at least once.

00:17:48.383 --> 00:17:51.250
When I was young,
I thought it was stupid.

00:17:51.453 --> 00:17:55.150
You are still quite young, Julia.

00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.155
Here you go.

00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:02.620
There. You sound
like a high school girl.

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:05.931
That jerk..!

00:18:10.872 --> 00:18:12.066
Murai!

00:18:12.474 --> 00:18:13.964
Were you scared?

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.243
Kunio?!

00:18:16.778 --> 00:18:19.838
Teacher! Kunio is..!
He can't swim!

00:18:19.948 --> 00:18:21.279
No problem.

00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:22.814
Hold my hand!!

00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.247
Here.

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.557
It's all right now!
Don't worry, Murai!

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:46.898
I know you did it on purpose.

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:49.904
Go on. If this helps you...

00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:54.072
...hit me
until your broken heart is mended.

00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:58.683
I'm here for you, as your teacher.

00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:02.354
Onizuka's cool sometimes.

00:19:02.524 --> 00:19:04.583
But somehow he looks too happy.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.355
So glad he didn't make it before me.

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:11.891
Why are you grinning?

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.231
I'm gonna beat you like this.

00:19:16.772 --> 00:19:18.797
My son will be fine.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.899
Broken hearts make
both men and women stronger.

00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:29.443
Then I must be pretty strong
as well...

00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:33.150
I'm sure.

00:19:41.163 --> 00:19:42.994
Damn, how do you like this?

00:19:43.064 --> 00:19:44.531
Oh, yeah. Give me more!

00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:47.426
You're like an octopus! Ouch!

00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:50.093
How are you doing, Kunio?

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.202
Take that girl home.

00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:54.375
What? What girl?

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.740
Taking a girl home is a boy's duty.

00:19:57.879 --> 00:20:00.814
That's why you lost
the game of love.

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.182
Kujirakawa...

00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:09.022
Fuyumi Kujirakawa...

00:20:09.758 --> 00:20:12.056
Why did you go down there?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.253
Doesn't matter.

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:18.130
How did you find out I was here?

00:20:19.367 --> 00:20:21.597
Because...you're always here...

00:20:21.736 --> 00:20:24.364
...when you're thinking
about something.

00:20:25.607 --> 00:20:28.098
Always...about me...

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:52.539
You can't love everyone

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.771
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.047 --> 00:21:59.949
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:05.351
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:09.919
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:14.131
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:22.272
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.068
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:28.813 --> 00:22:32.340
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:36.577
What is there for me to do?

00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:40.621
It may be small now

00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:44.784
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.625
A tear is about to drop

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:52.903
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:56.766
Live strong every moment

00:22:56.975 --> 00:23:02.914
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:19.420
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:19.597 --> 00:23:21.360
What? Fuyutsuki ran away?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.130
Where? Where? Where?

00:23:24.602 --> 00:23:25.864
HAKUBA STATION

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:31.272
Where are you? It's my fault!
Please come back, Fuyutsuki!

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:44.852
What does being a teacher mean?
