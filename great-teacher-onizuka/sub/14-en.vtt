WEBVTT

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:20.922
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.234
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:32.304
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:38.041
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:43.814
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:48.785
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:54.860
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:00:55.163 --> 00:01:00.658
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.797
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.999
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:13.212
Toward the finish line

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:41.585
Next problem.
Who performed the Taika Reforms?

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.352
Hantaro Nagaoka?

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:48.293
Who's that? It's wrong.
It's leyasu Tokugawa!

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:52.492
-Idiot, it's Nobunaga Oda!
-You're the dumbhead! It's leyasu!

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:55.171
-Shut up! It's Nobunaga!
-You bastard!

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:58.774
-You guys are both dumb.
-What?

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:03.538
It was performed by Prince Nakano-Oeno
and Kamatari Nakatomi.

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:06.410
The Taika Reforms were
political reforms...

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:10.849
...in the first year of Taika
after they destroyed the Soga clan.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.286
Kotoku took the throne,
Nakano-Oeno became prince...

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:16.653
...and Kamatari became minister.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.456
They established a new era
and moved the capitol to Namba.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.191
They established
the family registration system.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:29.464
They also enforced the Handen-Shuju
Law as well as taxation systems.

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:34.042
The central government and bureaucracy
were solidified in this era.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.112
There are theories
which deny the reforms.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.648
By the way, Hantaro Nagaoka was
a physics scholar.

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:44.617
Born in 1865 and died in 1950.

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:49.623
A professor at Tokyo University and
the first dean of Osaka University...

00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.058
...he contributed to the fields
of optics and physics.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:58.099
-Who cares about that stuff?
-This is no time to be laughing!

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.564
Japanese History
100 Questions

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.068
Unless you score highest
on the exam, you'll be fired!

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.472
-You have only a week.
-What are you gonna do?

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.113
I'll manage somehow.

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:12.111
You can't!

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.614
Oh, there you are!

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.878
I've been looking all over for you.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.558
What did you need me for?

00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:25.859
What's wrong?
You look pretty serious.

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:29.099
I have something important
to tell you.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.968
Would you like to sleep over
at my place for a week and study?

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:39.673
I'll be waiting for you
completely prepared.

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:46.510
I think Fuyutsuki-sensei lives alone
in a one-room apartment in Kugayama.

00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.150
What?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.989
Is it true? Are you sure?
I'll kill you if it's not true!

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.523
What are you getting excited about?

00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:00.390
You said it was a one-room?
She lives by herself?

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:04.090
Hey, come on!
Tell me! Hey, hey, hey!

00:04:12.677 --> 00:04:17.011
One room means a young man
and woman stay together alone...

00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:19.773
... under the same roof for a week!

00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:22.987
I wonder what we are going to study.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.452
-It's crowded.
-Yes.

00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.990
Are you sure you don't mind
letting me stay here?

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:39.363
What are you talking about?
You're on the verge of being fired.

00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.164
Here we are.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.642
Please come in.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.979
It's very spacious
for a one-room unit.

00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:52.809
That's why I decided
to rent this place.

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:56.214
Relax and make yourself comfortable.

00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:58.183
O.K.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.404
A treasure mound!

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.640
Smells feminine.

00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:26.550
Wow! Awesome!
I'm in a woman's room. A woman!

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:33.019
Starting today, a young man and woman
will sleep under one roof for a week.

00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:36.489
And every night we'll have
a "love " study session.

00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:42.393
Make sure you solve one problem
at a time.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:45.159
Love Soldier

00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:48.839
O.K. I'll solve problems!
I'll solve problems!

00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:50.905
Come on, you Y-curve, you!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.575
Geography

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.745
No, start with geography.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.105
ChiChiBu Basin

00:05:56.347 --> 00:05:59.874
-Come on, ChiChiBu Basin!
-That's the Southern Alps.

00:06:00.118 --> 00:06:03.815
The Northern Alps! Wow, the Fossa
Magna! Next is a rain forest.

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:05.647
Tropical Rain Forest

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:10.816
What kind of study group is this?

00:06:11.062 --> 00:06:13.053
What about a rain forest?

00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:15.960
Oh, no, I was just studying geography.

00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:18.965
-Wow, you're so motivated!
-Very!

00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:21.935
Then let's begin!

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:28.078
Energy drinks? Is it going
to be an all-night session?

00:06:28.313 --> 00:06:32.613
I won't let you sleep tonight.
I bought plenty of equipment.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.877
Wow, are we using equipment?

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:42.185
Just leave it to me.

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:50.060
Just between you and me,
I don't have much experience...

00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.566
...so I'll let you lead me.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.872
What is this?

00:06:59.144 --> 00:07:01.635
They're man-power
development equipment.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.438
Man-power development?

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:08.744
It's an excellent product
to cultivate potential capability.

00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:11.148
Did you feel the alpha wave?

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.984
I can feel a lot of cold sweat
running down my back.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:19.797
Here's dinner. Please eat a lot.

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:22.656
This?

00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:25.765
A grilled tuna head
contains a lot of DHA...

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:28.837
...which helps your brain
function better.

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:31.803
Especially in here.

00:07:32.043 --> 00:07:34.273
You want me to eat the eyeballs?

00:07:34.512 --> 00:07:39.211
Of course! I also made a tuna
eyeball salad. So help yourself.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.781
Mathematics: Basic Questions

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:45.615
-We'll work on workbooks all night.
-Workbooks?

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.283
-Not the rain forest?
-Leave it to me.

00:07:49.494 --> 00:07:50.620
One Week Schedule
ENDURANCE

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.154
If you follow this schedule...

00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:57.266
...you'll be able to score highest
in the national exam.

00:07:57.502 --> 00:08:02.405
I won't let you get fired,
no matter what!

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.668
I see an assignment during sleep time.

00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:10.910
This is a "learning
while sleeping" method.

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.050
Learning while sleeping?

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:27.095
Why is he there?

00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:31.335
Kiosk

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:33.366
Onizuka-kun at your place?

00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.208
Leave it to me. We'll surprise
the Vice Principal and everybody else.

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:41.276
Is that so? I'm confident in you.

00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:44.106
But I have mixed feelings
as a principal...

00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:47.716
...about teachers from
the same school living together.

00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:52.184
No! It's not living together!
That's not the case.

00:08:53.258 --> 00:08:59.686
I'm teasing. Onizuka-kun will overcome
any obstacles. I believe in him.

00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:01.228
Principal!

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:07.132
You're wasting your time and energy
trying to help such a loser.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:12.272
-Who founded the Mongolian Empire?
-Yoshitsune Minamono.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.774
Who is the 8th Tokugawa shogun?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:19.313
Ken Matsudaira. No, Toshiyuki Nishida.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.279
Goal for Tokyo University

00:09:22.153 --> 00:09:26.590
You're tired. You've been studying
for 10 hours straight now.

00:09:26.824 --> 00:09:29.315
Let's take a break
and have some snacks.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.223
What? Snacks? Yeah! Yeah!

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:40.701
The tuna head didn't look appetizing
so I made it into a dessert.

00:09:40.938 --> 00:09:43.133
Doesn't it look delicious?

00:09:47.078 --> 00:09:49.546
I can't stand this lifestyle!

00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:53.547
Calm down! Why don't you listen
to the alpha wave music?

00:09:56.854 --> 00:10:00.290
"Want to" means shitai.

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:04.325
"To be able to" means dekiru.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.725
"May" means shite yoi.

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:12.163
"Had better" means shita hoga yoi.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:16.601
"Desire," yokubo.

00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:21.574
How much longer does this last?

00:10:23.648 --> 00:10:27.084
He'll be fired.
It's almost 100% sure.

00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:30.583
Even though it's only
junior high school level...

00:10:30.822 --> 00:10:33.848
...that idiot won't be able
to score the highest.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:38.085
But Murai and the others have
been hanging out with Onizuka.

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.354
Also, Kikuchi is in their group.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:44.967
That's true.
That guy is supersmart, isn't he?

00:10:47.338 --> 00:10:49.397
Miyabi?

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.202
Bread that makes you smart

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:57.346
I heard that it contained
what's called DOHC.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.009
DOHC? That's an engine, isn't it?

00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:04.346
DHA, docosahexaenoic acid.

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:06.750
Are you all right? You look pale.

00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:09.118
Onizuka-sensei!

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.228
It's time. Let's review
what you learned yesterday.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.796
O.K.

00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:24.765
That's hell.

00:11:25.343 --> 00:11:27.709
He's probably expecting heaven.

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:30.573
He might actually go to heaven.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.875
His brain is not meant for studying.

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:37.610
Now, as the last resort,
we should do him a favor.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.550
Isn't it too risky?

00:11:42.794 --> 00:11:46.252
-Do you want Onizuka to be fired?
-But, still....

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:52.060
Don't do it. If someone finds out,
you'll get expelled. It's too risky.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.835
Shut up.
Do you have any better ideas?

00:11:56.073 --> 00:11:59.975
I'm indebted to Onizuka in a way.
So I can't abandon him.

00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:04.173
I'll do it myself, even if you don't.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:08.215
I'll do it tonight. O.K.?

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:12.551
ChiChiBu Basin.

00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:18.778
Name - Eikichi Onizuka

00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:21.746
[Hold Out! Japan!]

00:12:29.293 --> 00:12:30.624
Time is up.

00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:34.991
Wow, I'm sure
all the answers are correct!

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:37.800
Your hard work must be paying off.

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:42.768
-Look at these!
-Then I'll grade your papers.

00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:48.576
I'm so impressed that I solved
all those problems all by myself.

00:12:48.812 --> 00:12:53.977
I have this feeling of accomplishment.
I might get hooked on studying.

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.149
How was it?

00:13:08.632 --> 00:13:12.625
It can't be!
I wrote all the answers.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.466
Did you make mistakes grading?
Such bad scores!

00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:21.872
Let's do it again.
I'll be dead serious this time.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.567
Are you sure the national
exam papers are in here?

00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:58.009
I saw the Vice Principal
putting them in this safe.

00:13:58.248 --> 00:14:01.081
I also saw the combination.

00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:05.721
Hurry! If we're too slow, we'll
get caught by the security guards.

00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:10.617
It's open! We did it!
As long as we have this...

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:12.260
National Scholastic
Trial Examination

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:13.986
...Onizuka will--

00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:16.290
That's it, you guys!

00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:20.560
You guys are stupid. Did you
think you could get away with it?

00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:26.465
You guys are so naive. To get expelled
for the sake of a dumb teacher.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.268
Aizawa.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:32.171
-They're the ones!
-What are you guys doing?

00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:36.318
This is the end. Why don't you
give up and take your masks off?

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:38.748
You betrayers, Murai and friends!

00:14:39.323 --> 00:14:44.522
-Let me see your face!
-We'll hand you over to the police!

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:52.998
-I can't turn on the light!
-Check the breakers!

00:15:02.112 --> 00:15:03.943
They got away.

00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:06.149
-What happened?
-I don't know.

00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:12.088
That's why I said
it was too much risk.

00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.047
It's impossible.

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:18.989
Unless somebody performs
transformation surgery on me...

00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:21.220
...I can't score highest.

00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:23.729
With a strong will and muscles...

00:15:23.967 --> 00:15:27.164
...I can manage in anything
but academic fields.

00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:30.100
Maybe I'm not suited to be a teacher.

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:41.982
Don't pretend you don't know anything.
It won't do you any good.

00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:46.519
We know what you did last night.
It was a criminal act.

00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:48.850
That wench, Aizawa, she told on us!

00:15:49.092 --> 00:15:53.051
You don't mind getting expelled
for that piece of trash Onizuka?

00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:57.763
-Is there any proof that it was us?
-Right. Do you have proof?

00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:59.832
What?

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:03.867
All right.
If you do it one more time...

00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:09.340
...you will definitely get caught
and be expelled. Be prepared!

00:16:09.713 --> 00:16:14.514
If we don't get caught,
we won't get expelled or punished.

00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:16.048
We'll do it again!

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:19.847
Don't interfere in my business!

00:16:20.324 --> 00:16:22.417
They're only thinking of you.

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:28.620
I'm not so helpless and downtrodden
that you need to take pity on me.

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:33.499
Besides, I can't let
my students take any more risks...

00:16:33.737 --> 00:16:36.968
...for a teacher.

00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:39.739
You guys stay put and watch.

00:16:39.977 --> 00:16:43.879
I'll show you what
it takes to be a teacher.

00:16:44.348 --> 00:16:45.940
Goal for Tokyo University

00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:53.850
Wow, I almost fell asleep.

00:16:54.258 --> 00:16:59.560
You're pushing too far. You don't need
to put needles on your forehead.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.462
Don't worry.

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:06.362
I can't learn the lesson
unless I go to such an extreme.

00:17:06.603 --> 00:17:09.731
It was good stimulation.

00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:16.943
Wow, I almost fell asleep.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.879
Please stop! You will bleed
to death before the exam!

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.381
Leave me alone.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.886
What happened? All of a sudden,
you're so motivated.

00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:31.117
I declared to them that
I will score highest...

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:35.358
...and show them
what it takes to be a teacher.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:39.535
When you make such a declaration,
there's no choice but to do it.

00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:16.196
Why don't you take a bath?
You haven't bathed in a week.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.533
It will help you relax.

00:18:22.913 --> 00:18:28.146
That's right. It's already tomorrow.
The test of destiny.

00:18:30.687 --> 00:18:35.056
Tomorrow will be doomsday for
that perverted Cro-Magnon man...

00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:37.556
...who embarrassed you
and your mother.

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:41.252
He'll be taken away
in disgrace from our school...

00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:44.331
...and from the world
of education.

00:18:54.077 --> 00:18:58.138
Eikichi Onizuka, what an annoying man!

00:18:58.382 --> 00:19:01.317
Who does he think I am?

00:19:05.188 --> 00:19:07.486
It's no fun to punish you!

00:19:07.724 --> 00:19:09.851
Dear Hidemi....

00:19:27.911 --> 00:19:31.506
Onizuka-sensei, he has already left.

00:19:31.748 --> 00:19:33.181
Holy Forest Academy

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:36.648
In 1946, proclamation
of Constitution in Japan....

00:19:36.887 --> 00:19:40.220
It's no use.
You're gonna be fired anyway.

00:19:40.724 --> 00:19:42.692
Hey, it's you again.

00:19:43.293 --> 00:19:48.731
It's not too late. If you don't want
to lose your job, just lick my feet.

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:54.369
I'm sorry, but I have no intention
of asking you to help me. Understand?

00:19:54.604 --> 00:19:58.335
Idiot! Are you making light
of me, you incompetent teacher?

00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:02.267
If you want your feet licked,
find a dog or a cat.

00:20:02.512 --> 00:20:04.446
What? You lick them!

00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:06.512
-No.
-Lick them!

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.718
What a persistent child!

00:20:08.952 --> 00:20:14.447
Please lick them! How come only you
won't do what I tell you to?

00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:18.354
Never mind. You irritate me.
I'm going home!

00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:20.995
Yeah, yeah. Do whatever you like.

00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:26.328
What in the world is wrong with her?
She's gotta be a pervert.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.939
What are you doing to me? Stop it!

00:20:40.517 --> 00:20:43.714
Sorry, kid.
I need you to come with me.

00:20:43.954 --> 00:20:46.422
Don't worry. I won't be rash...

00:20:47.023 --> 00:20:50.117
...only if your father,
the assemblyman...

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.796
...does what we ask him to do.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:21:01.595
Futogaki-san, a weird newspaper
delivery guy is following us.

00:21:01.838 --> 00:21:02.964
What is that?

00:21:03.206 --> 00:21:07.609
In the year 645, the family
of Soga-no-Ohji perished.

00:21:07.844 --> 00:21:12.543
In 752, the giant Buddha of Todai-ji
was established.

00:21:12.783 --> 00:21:16.913
In 794, the capitol was transferred
to Heian-kyo.

00:21:17.154 --> 00:21:21.955
In 1053, Ho-oh-doh of Byodo-in
was built.

00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:26.652
In 1059, the revolution
by the Heike clan began.

00:21:26.897 --> 00:21:29.661
You bastards!
I need to take an exam!

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:45.766
You and me, let's go away

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:50.999
To look for new emotions today

00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:56.045
Together we can overcome

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:01.982
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:06.385
Open your eyes and open the door

00:22:07.194 --> 00:22:11.597
The world in front of your eyes

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:17.200
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:21.802
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:32.610
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:42.618
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:47.027
I want to see you, but I can't

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.101
So I just embrace my love

00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:57.207
Even walking on a crowded street

00:22:57.477 --> 00:23:03.780
Your smile makes my head spin

00:23:14.628 --> 00:23:15.959
Next Episode

00:23:17.998 --> 00:23:21.297
Which gang do I belong to?
3rd grade, class 4!

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:24.729
This isn't child's play,
you know, teacher.

00:23:25.439 --> 00:23:26.463
Onizuka.

00:23:27.007 --> 00:23:29.271
Then, goodbye.
