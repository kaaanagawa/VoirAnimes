Hey, there! Watch out!

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.407
You boys! Stay away from here!

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.825
It's dangerous. You can't
come in here without permission.

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:48.903
Sorry.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:49.971
What do you want?

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.063
I need to talk to my mom...
ah, my mother.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.503
Your mother?

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.707
We don't have
a middle-aged woman...

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:59.211
...who has a child your age.

00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:01.974
Did you come here
to tease the adults?!

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:03.183
No!

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:05.076
Anyway, get out of here!

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:06.914
We'll talk in my office.

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.988
Why?!

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.081
Mom! Help me!

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:11.380
Mom!

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:12.915
Kunio!

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:17.186
Did you come all the way here
to ask for your allowance?

00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:19.124
No!

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:20.906
It was your idea...

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.607
...to have a BBQ party
at our house!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.182
So I brought my friends here.

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:25.252
Hello!

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:28.888
Uh-oh. I forgot about that! Sorry!

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:31.452
Man, she's so absent-minded!

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:34.084
Mom?! That means...

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:36.496
Is he your son?

00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:39.760
What's the big deal?

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:44.333
Well, he does resemble
you and he's very cute!

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.430
He looks bright, too. Are you?!

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.205
He's sure changed his tune now!

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:54.745
I'm almost off.
Hang on for just a minute!

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.296
Your mom,
when she was working...

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.495
...at the construction site,
looked pretty sharp!

00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:17.805
Really?

00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:20.136
My old man works in an office.

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.604
He's so worried about a layoff,
there's blood in his urine every day.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.004
It's a shame!

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:28.415
Thanks for waiting!

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:29.683
Let's start!

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.650
You must be hungry.

00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:34.249
Eat as much as you want!

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:44.059
A beer after work is so refreshing!

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.858
It's hot! Really hot!

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:48.494
M-Mom!

00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:51.971
Aren't you hungry?

00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:54.136
Oh, I see. You're being polite!

00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:57.607
Both Fujiyoshi and Kusano
are so sweet!

00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:00.874
That's not the reason
they're not eating!

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:02.706
Why are you wearing that outfit?!

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.311
Because it's hot.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.418
It's already summer.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.552
The time goes by so fast.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.319
Man, it's hot.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.627
Stop it!

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.924
Don't you have some
more modest clothes?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.292
Come on, change them!

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:18.823
Change them!

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:20.491
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends!

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:22.135
I don't care.

00:04:22.237 --> 00:04:23.966
I'm embarrassed.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.306
Don't worry about it, Murai.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:29.041
We don't mind at all.

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:30.303
That's right.

00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:31.838
I mind!

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:39.014
Man, she's a woman.
She should be more careful.

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:41.814
If Onizuka saw her like that...

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.059
The other outfit was better.

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:49.496
Onizuka!

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.561
What rock did you
crawl out from under?!

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.162
You cockroach!

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.300
I'm doing a home visit.

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:01.068
Oh, Onizuka-sensei!

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.834
It's been quite a while!

00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:06.842
Don't moon over her!

00:05:09.784 --> 00:05:11.945
Hi. It's time for Shiatsu massage.
Tonight's guest...

00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:15.381
-...is Tomoko Nomura.
- That Onizuka ate all of our meat.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.651
- Good evening! I'm Tomoko.
- It was our meat!

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:18.917
I'll have to keep an eye on him.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.752
Why don't you come in, too?

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.998
It's been a while. Why don't Mom
and her little boy share a bath?

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:25.199
No, thank you!

00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:26.901
Why not?

00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:29.133
It wasn't that long ago
that we took baths together.

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:30.597
When did we do that?!

00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:32.472
I'm in high school now!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.106
Then I can check on
how you're growing.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:39.346
Don't say stupid things!

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:41.209
Hey! Kunio!

00:05:41.816 --> 00:05:43.044
Come on!

00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:45.983
Be good to your mom
once in while!

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:48.380
Why don't you rinse
off my back? Hello!

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:50.551
Shut up! Be good to my mom?!

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.094
She shouldn't keep it
around for so long.

00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:58.956
If anyone sees it,
I'll be embarrassed.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:03.166
Your wedding photo? Is this it?

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:07.105
It wasn't like we could have
a ceremony with your dad.

00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:08.870
Before we could
have the wedding...

00:06:08.977 --> 00:06:10.205
... we were already separated.

00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:14.246
So giving birth to you
and becoming a mother...

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.009
... was the only proof
I was married.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.855
And so, this is an important
photo of my marriage.

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:31.329
I envy you. Your mom is...

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:33.433
...young and pretty.

00:06:33.701 --> 00:06:36.169
It's unusual to find
a mother so young.

00:06:37.138 --> 00:06:39.129
It's not surprising that Onizuka
would make a pass at her.

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:44.070
We even think she's attractive.

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:45.743
No way!

00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:50.306
But why hasn't such
a pretty woman married?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.483
It wouldn't be surprising for her
to have one or two boyfriends.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.087
She's very pretty.

00:06:57.892 --> 00:07:00.622
Don't be so stupid!
My mom would never...

00:07:09.037 --> 00:07:11.130
Damn! That was a cheap trick!

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.038
You were seriously upset!

00:07:13.207 --> 00:07:15.232
Don't be such an idiot!
I'm not a baby.

00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:18.778
If she wants to get married,
it's fine with me.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.478
I have no intention of objecting.

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.410
Are you seriously okay with it?

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.648
Because she has her own life...

00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:32.521
I suppose she should think about
her own happiness from now on.

00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:34.756
- Great!
- I didn't know you were so mature.

00:07:35.263 --> 00:07:38.596
Of course.
I'm not a child anymore.

00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:43.498
What's up, Fujiyoshi?

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:46.536
Nothing. But the woman
who just walked by....

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.169
...looked just like Murai's mom.

00:07:50.144 --> 00:07:53.011
Mom is supposed to be working
at the construction site.

00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:56.248
That's what I thought.
I guess I was mistaken.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.875
That woman was with a man.

00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:00.581
What? With a man?!

00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:02.089
Where is she?! Hey!

00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:07.084
KICHIJOJI FIRST BRIDAL HALL

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.063
Mom!!

00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:15.898
It's just some old man.
Don't scare me like that.

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.035
When you said
she was with a man...

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:19.834
...I was worried
that he may be a date.

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:21.773
But who's that old geezer?

00:08:22.643 --> 00:08:24.304
I suppose it's
someone from her work.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.013
There's no way my mom would
ever go out with that old fart.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.545
But this place is...

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.887
They must be here for
a business lunch or something.

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:39.016
How often do people have lunch...

00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.116
...at a wedding chapel?

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:41.462
Wedding?

00:08:42.363 --> 00:08:44.558
And people don't come
to a wedding chapel...

00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:46.426
...on business.

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:50.099
What's going on?!

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:51.398
DISCOUNT WEDDING FAIR

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:53.303
She can't be. With that bald man?!

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.374
Mom...

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:58.203
What are you doing?! Hey!

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:00.574
Are you going to marry
that old bald man?!

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:02.512
Don't play with me!

00:09:02.617 --> 00:09:03.709
- Stop it, Murai!
- I guess...

00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:04.785
...you're really not okay with this!

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:09.745
This can't be true.

00:09:10.224 --> 00:09:11.521
This isn't even funny.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:13.984
She's at the wedding chapel
with that fat, short, bald guy...

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.460
... who looks like
Dr. Ochanomizu?!

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.527
What's going on?!

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.425
I'm home!

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:22.424
I got a little tipsy.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.630
What's with that expression?

00:09:28.576 --> 00:09:30.771
Are you upset that your mom
came home a little drunk?

00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.409
Who were you drinking with?

00:09:32.713 --> 00:09:34.044
It's none of your business.

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.506
Even I have...

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.841
...some friends
I can socialize with.

00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:39.410
Socialize?

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.653
I'm tired.

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:45.450
Good night!

00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:48.052
Don't sleep there!

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:51.857
She's so sloppy.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.094
Hey, Kunio.

00:09:55.736 --> 00:09:56.725
If...

00:09:57.405 --> 00:10:01.034
If...I decided to get married...

00:10:01.342 --> 00:10:03.003
...what would you think?

00:10:03.544 --> 00:10:04.602
M-Married?

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.842
I said "if"!

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:10.715
Why would you say
that out of the blue?

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:12.382
Is it so bizarre?

00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:14.410
Give me some credit.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.489
I'm more popular than you think.

00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:20.986
Are you serious?
You've got to be kidding!

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:23.563
I'm still in my prime.

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.557
My skin is soft and smooth.

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:29.732
I'm more appealing
than most young women...

00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:32.469
That's not what I'm talking about!
What's going on, Mom?!

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.015
There's definitely
something going on.

00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:50.350
Suddenly she's talking
about marriage.

00:10:51.926 --> 00:10:53.723
I mean, with that
Dr. Ochanomizu look alike?!

00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:58.489
No! There is no way anything
could happen with that old guy.

00:11:06.807 --> 00:11:09.708
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.834
Hey!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.706
She can't be serious!

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.976
HA NA YO ME NO MU SU KO
(A SON OF A BRIDE)

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.557
Are you kidding?!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.779
Your mom?!

00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:28.619
There's no mistake.

00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:33.129
I thought it was suspicious
when she mentioned marriage.

00:11:33.844 --> 00:11:34.811
So it's just like I thought.

00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:36.313
Wait a minute!

00:11:36.547 --> 00:11:40.176
Even if your mom is open-minded,
there has to be a limit.

00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:42.543
She can't be
with that old bald man.

00:11:43.187 --> 00:11:44.745
Even Onizuka is better than that.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.626
Is that right?
So Julia likes older guys.

00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:50.694
Onizuka!

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.058
Then I'll compete looking like this.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.221
It's not too late.

00:11:56.834 --> 00:12:00.497
Hey! Don't joke around
when I'm angry!

00:12:00.938 --> 00:12:02.701
It's none of your business.
Go away!

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.102
Do you approve
of your mom's marriage?

00:12:06.477 --> 00:12:10.208
He may be bald or whatever...

00:12:10.347 --> 00:12:12.542
...but if Julia truly loves him...

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.085
...you shouldn't stand in her way,
even if you're her son.

00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:19.681
She loves him? That old guy?

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.455
But if that isn't the case...

00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:26.055
Here's my theory.

00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:30.462
A rich guy who's always had
his eye on Julia approached her...

00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:33.092
...with a lot of smooth talk.

00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:37.367
Julia, who had a stupid son,
and worried about her future...

00:12:37.474 --> 00:12:39.032
...was charmed.

00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:41.335
Even though she may not love him.

00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:49.750
Therefore, the old guy...

00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:52.719
...took advantage
of Julia's insecurity...

00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:54.484
...by trying to marry her.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.354
But the guy is shrewd.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.226
He knows about her circumstances
and showers her with money.

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:09.229
Are you okay with this happening?!

00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:12.667
I can't allow it!

00:13:12.943 --> 00:13:15.503
That Dr. Ochanomizu clone!

00:13:15.746 --> 00:13:18.306
He tricked my mom!

00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:20.383
Don't mess around with us!

00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:23.076
How can this marriage
be allowed?!

00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:26.987
We'll help you.

00:13:27.424 --> 00:13:28.448
Yeah, you can count on us!

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.714
We'll help you, Murai!

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:36.223
What are you going to do today?

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:37.622
It's Sunday.

00:13:38.268 --> 00:13:39.326
Aren't you going anywhere?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.601
It's none of your business
what I'm doing.

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:44.669
What?! How dare
you talk to me like that!

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:51.141
She's taking a lot of time
to put on her makeup today.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:53.280
She doesn't
usually use makeup.

00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:55.543
She must be seeing that old guy.

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:58.882
The guy's deception is bad,
but it's Mom's fault, too.

00:13:59.656 --> 00:14:01.988
She's sneaking off
without even telling her own son!

00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:04.493
This is no time to hum!

SUMMER 2000
WEDDING DRESS CATALOG

00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:08.965
Well, I'm going out for a while.

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:10.932
I'll probably be in late.

00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:12.925
For dinner, take something
from the refrigerator...

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:15.436
...and warm it up to eat.
See you later!

00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:20.106
I'll prevent your marriage
with my own hands!

00:14:25.883 --> 00:14:27.578
I know where you're going.

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:30.083
She must plan on discussing
the wedding ceremony.

00:14:30.654 --> 00:14:32.884
She's really strutting her stuff!

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.458
Don't look so happy!

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.560
Even if he is rich, you'd get
married to that old man?!

00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:40.854
I'm disappointed in you, Mom!

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.537
That idiot!

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:48.964
What an outfit!

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:51.934
Here! Here! Julia!

00:14:52.242 --> 00:14:54.039
Sorry for making you wait!

00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:55.976
- Shall we go, then?
- Yes.

00:14:56.413 --> 00:14:58.005
You're even more
lovely than usual.

00:14:59.449 --> 00:15:00.814
Knock off the sweet talk!

00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:03.785
Damn that old fart!

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.353
He's too friendly with my mom!

00:15:06.657 --> 00:15:08.750
I, Kunio Murai, will make
you wish you'd never met her.

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:11.226
Look! It's like we thought!

00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:12.295
What should we do, teacher?

00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:16.426
We have to help him out.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.197
Excuse me, sir!

00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:19.536
You!

00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:21.031
Excuse me!

00:15:21.738 --> 00:15:23.603
I'm looking for a wedding party.

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:26.005
Whose wedding is it?

00:15:26.376 --> 00:15:28.367
Well, it was... Suzuki.

00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.404
Uh, no... Abe.

00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:32.080
Or was it Hagino?

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:35.680
Sounds something like that.

00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:39.217
Who are those boys?

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.323
I don't know.

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:44.025
I'd like you to come to our office.

00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:47.152
That's it! It was the Weasel
Room on the third floor.

00:15:47.397 --> 00:15:48.455
Now I remember.

00:15:48.665 --> 00:15:49.962
We don't have any such room.

00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.161
What? The groom isn't coming?!

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.138
I'm afraid so. We've
been calling his home...

00:15:56.273 --> 00:15:59.367
...but I can't contact
anyone in the groom's family.

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:01.443
It's almost time
for the ceremony to start.

00:16:01.712 --> 00:16:03.543
If we don't fix this,
she'll be absolutely miserable!

00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:05.046
- Please come this way!
- Let go of me!

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:09.715
You can talk to us in the office.

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.015
Yamada! Is that you, Yamada?!

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.784
What a great day for a wedding!

00:16:15.993 --> 00:16:17.585
My apologies.

00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:24.295
I don't know who you are,
but thank you very much.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:25.595
- See you, then.
- Wait a minute!

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:28.462
Do you want something from me?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.800
I need to talk to you.

00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:32.365
Teacher. Hurry up!

00:16:32.843 --> 00:16:34.674
I'm in kind of a rush...

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:37.409
Hey, mister?
What are you doing?!

00:16:38.382 --> 00:16:39.349
Excuse me!

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:40.883
Oh, well!

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:44.747
I will never allow this marriage!

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.582
I'm going to ruin it!

00:16:47.858 --> 00:16:50.486
Hey! Where did you go?!
Ochanomizu!

00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:52.785
Come out! Let's fight!

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.277
Mom...

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.916
You! How could you?!

00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:54.456
I'll never forgive you!

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.350
- Kunio?!
- Who's that?!

00:17:57.861 --> 00:17:59.260
You! Ochanomizu!

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.288
How could you
do this to my mom?!

00:18:06.403 --> 00:18:07.370
Over there!

00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.166
Wait! Wait a minute!

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:12.807
Mister! I'll listen to you later!

00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:14.206
Please let go of me!

00:18:19.449 --> 00:18:20.677
What's this?!

00:18:20.784 --> 00:18:22.342
Not good! It's not good!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.577
Someone..!

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.177
Stop it, Kunio!

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.217
Don't protect him!

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:29.551
It's your fault, too!

00:18:30.394 --> 00:18:32.521
You're having a wedding
without telling your own son!

00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:33.796
Get out of the way!

00:18:33.897 --> 00:18:34.864
Murai!

00:18:34.998 --> 00:18:35.965
Don't stop me, Onizuka!

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:38.601
Stop it!

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:51.077
It's not like you thought, Murai.

00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:52.880
Because...

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.010
All right. Take a break!

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.648
Kunio is really hot-headed.

00:18:58.488 --> 00:19:01.889
I apologize
for my stupid son's actions.

00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:05.855
You called Mizushima,
the president, Ochanomizu?!

00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:09.457
Hey, you apologize
to him, too! Kunio!

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.292
That's all right.

00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.468
He thought an old man
like me was Julia's groom.

00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:18.274
I feel honored.

00:19:19.176 --> 00:19:22.202
But he is exactly like you,
Julia. He is full of energy.

00:19:24.114 --> 00:19:28.915
I never imagined Mom could
be modeling a wedding dress.

00:19:30.187 --> 00:19:32.485
I was a little
self-conscious at first...

00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:35.614
...but after our company
built this hall...

00:19:36.493 --> 00:19:40.122
...the president asked
me to do him a favor.

00:19:41.364 --> 00:19:43.662
Really! You're so stupid!

00:19:45.802 --> 00:19:49.135
If I got married, there's no way
I would do it without telling you!

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.938
You've got a hopeless
mother complex!

00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:59.181
Just once, I wanted to wear...

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.212
...a wedding dress.

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:04.419
I've never worn one before.

00:20:05.188 --> 00:20:06.155
Mom...

00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:10.356
Not bad, huh?!

00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.920
Your mom in a wedding dress!

00:20:14.164 --> 00:20:17.463
I don't look like I have
a child in high school, do I?

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:20.864
Don't you agree, Kunio?

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.568
Say something!

00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:26.406
When I saw her...

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.001
...in her wedding dress
for the first time...

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.704
...she was very, very beautiful.

00:20:32.449 --> 00:20:34.041
As her son...

00:20:34.384 --> 00:20:37.182
... I had mixed feelings.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.615
- I don't want to!
- Here, Kunio!

00:20:42.726 --> 00:20:43.852
Dear God...

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:47.421
...please don't let the day come...

00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:49.897
... when she wears
this dress for real.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.668
Murai's mom really looked
good in the wedding dress.

00:20:55.372 --> 00:20:56.964
It's natural to have...

00:20:57.073 --> 00:20:58.870
...a mother complex
with a mom like that.

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:00.976
Do you have time now?

00:21:01.711 --> 00:21:03.804
Well, what do you want from me?

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:10.450
Now we'll have the cake
cutting by the bride and groom.

00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:11.521
This is...

00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:13.020
...the first act they're going
to perform as a couple.

00:21:13.123 --> 00:21:15.683
Everyone, please
give them a big hand!

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.627
If you have a camera,
please come up front...

00:21:18.728 --> 00:21:20.992
No matter what,
it's not a good sign...

00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:22.826
...that I'm substituting
for your groom.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:24.834
