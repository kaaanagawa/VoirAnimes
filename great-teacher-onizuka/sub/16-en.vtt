Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:12.982
Saikou no finale wo! Yeah!

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.152
O.K. Then, I'll use
a gun microphone from now on.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.595
Now, let's go to a live report...

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.032
...five, four, three, two, one...

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:48.265
Today, I'm interviewing Onizuka,
a new teacher at a private school...

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.801
...who rescued the kidnapped daughter
of an assemblyman like an action hero!

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.337
Onizuka-sensei...

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.511
Hello!

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.055
I'm Eikichi Onizuka,
22 years old, a bachelor!

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.087
My hobbies are cosplay
and surfing the Internet.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:08.588
I'm currently looking for a girlfriend!

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.456
Isn't this a nationwide broadcast?

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.891
He is hopeless...
desperately hopeless...

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.262
Let me ask you about the incident.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:18.664
It was such a courageous act.
But weren't you scared?

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.067
HEISEI VERSION KINPACHI
(Next Famous Teacher)

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.868
I concentrated more on the mission,
rather than the fear, I should say.

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:26.740
ONIZUKA, 22 YEARS OLD, SINGLE
OCCUPATION: GREAT TEACHER,
SEEKING GIRLFRIEND

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.643
By the way, my favorite type
of girl is Nanako Matsushima.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.079
I heard that you were shot
with a pistol in the abdomen.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.142
Well...compared
to her emotional pain...

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.949
...taking a bullet or two
was just like an itch!

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.885
Ah, the age limit is 19!

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.925
It's kind of a hassle
after the law passed...

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.892
Those were the comments
from Eikichi Onizuka.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:45.759
A mere teacher for life!

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:46.923
CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON:
KANT

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:48.260
Any girl who looks like
Nanako Matsushima!

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.300
PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS:
WITTGENSTEIN

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:50.460
I'm waiting for your letter!

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.226
Would you show
my mailing address?

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:53.464
Why would we do that?

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.904
See? Interesting, isn't he?

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:58.902
It could be a little entertainment
to kill time, I think.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.639
That's all from here,
live in Kichijoji!

00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:05.148
Please don't edit out the part
about my looking for a girlfriend.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.310
- Please! Please!
- It's a live broadcast!

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.352
Eikichi Onizuka!
Yoroshiku!

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.723
Back to you, in studio!

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.855
Miyabi... it didn't work?

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.825
Yes, it did.

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:25.436
I know her character
better than anyone else does.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.640
That girl certainly got interested!

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.631
If that's the case..!

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.510
It's all over
for Onizuka this time...

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.447
Please give me more time!

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.607
I beg of you!
Please! Please!

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:39.684
Help! Hee! Help!

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.751
So...

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.488
Have you received any letters...

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.392
...or calls from women saying
they want to be your girlfriend?

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:51.551
Nothing.

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:52.652
I figured...

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.892
No! It's not over yet!

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.998
There must be
complicated reasons like...

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.695
...post offices were closed for holidays
or the phone system was down or...

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.636
Eikichi, let me
clarify this for you!

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.699
There is no way you can attract a girl
after acting so stupid on national TV!

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.266
Did you say stupid? Stupid?!

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.037
Anyone would think you're stupid!

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:09.705
What was up with that
weird dinosaur get-up?

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.177
Oh, no...
you guys are at it again!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.514
Ever since high school
you guys were quick to pick a fight...

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.815
...and couldn't get rid of
your bad habits.

00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:18.022
You guys haven't made
much progress.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.182
Nagisa...

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:20.957
Nagisa! Long time no see!

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.991
Don't touch my girl!

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:27.799
Stingy!

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.430
Here you are!

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:32.762
I saw you on TV
and in the newspapers.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:36.237
Eikichi seems more and more
like a real teacher.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.775
Well... I would say
it's my vocation...

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:39.902
Just his imagination,
just his imagination!

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:43.640
If you find a cute girlfriend,
your rosy life will be complete!

00:04:46.184 --> 00:04:47.742
You're right!

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:50.117
That's my current headache!

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:52.785
Hey, Nagisa,
aren't there girls at your college...

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.222
...cute, gentle,
and voluptuous like you?

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.291
I guess...
there is no such girl...

00:04:59.364 --> 00:05:01.264
Come on, Eikichi...

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.994
I'm serious.
Nagisa, you're a man's fantasy...

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:07.538
...no, ideal itself!

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.937
Your boobs...and boobs...
and boobs...

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.501
But it's not that easy.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.840
They give me stiff shoulders.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.312
Besides, I heard they would
hang low when I get old.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.674
I see.

00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:22.820
I happen to know a pressure point
for keeping your boobs firm and up.

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:23.910
Do you want me to press it?

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.078
What?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.886
This one has been passed down
for a million years in China...

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.587
...and is believed to have
miraculous efficacy.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.595
Women who have this point
pressed are said...

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.324
...to have "rocket boobs"
even at the age of 90.

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.059
"Bee-tick, bee-tick.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:36.395
Tick-tick, toon-toon."

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.935
Where's the non-flabby point?

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:43.341
You punched me really hard!
Seriously!

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:45.205
Shut up! You tried to massage
my girlfriend's boobs!

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.574
Hey. You are monopolizing
those giant boobs!

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:48.010
Your attitude sucks!
You, the pervert teacher!

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.172
Stop it, you two!

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:52.372
A girlfriend.

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.510
I need to get serious
about finding one.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.084
I wish I could find one
lying around somewhere.

00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:58.918
Her hair should be long
like this.

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.685
She should be slender
with big boobs...

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.992
...wearing a skirt with a slit,
looking sharp...

00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:05.129
Wow!

00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:07.030
Lucky!

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.163
I heard about a fountain
in a foreign country...

00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:11.701
...where you throw a coin
over your shoulder...

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.863
...and your wish comes true
or something.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.506
So, let there be luck!

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.872
I guess I sound like
a superstitious old man.

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:23.344
I wish I could find a cute girlfriend!

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:28.413
Well, it would be too easy
if I could find one just by doing this!

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:33.950
Wow!

00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:38.959
Her hair should be long...

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.726
...slender with big boobs...

00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.672
...wearing a skirt with a slit,
looking sharp...

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:52.176
Is...is this a dream?

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:55.144
Or did that five-yen coin
actually work so fast?

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:57.203
Teacher?

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:58.349
WHAT?!

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:03.017
You're Onizuka-sensei, aren't you?

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:04.578
You were on TV.

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:05.748
Uh...yes...

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:10.284
I became a huge fan of yours
after watching that talk show!

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.953
BANZAI DAYTIME NEWS SHOW

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:13.188
Hail to the Talk Show!

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.866
You!

00:07:19.704 --> 00:07:23.037
Um...uh...it's my motorcycle.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.772
Then let's go!

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.905
Go...? Where?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.713
It's obvious...isn't it?

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.276
Well...the only place...

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.652
I haven't asked your name yet.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.151
What? What did you say?

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.191
Name!

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.256
Urumi Kanzaki!

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:43.725
Urumi.

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.352
That's an unusual name.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.896
So, Urumi, how old are you?

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:50.957
Nineteen!

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:53.401
Bingo! She's barely safe!

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:56.535
Ah! Turn right there and stop!

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.075
Oh, all right.

00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.508
Good! No one's here!

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:08.845
This place is...

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.487
LAUNDROMAT

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:23.194
Don't tell me she wants
to do it in a place like this.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:24.859
Too bold, baby!

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:26.397
Teacher...

00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:31.374
Whoa...wow!

00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:34.770
I'll never forget you,
Urumi Kanzaki!

00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:36.040
My first girl...

00:08:40.018 --> 00:08:42.009
Now, let me use this
until my clothes dry.

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:49.420
I might catch a cold
if I stay in wet clothes!

00:08:50.328 --> 00:08:52.853
So, the place you
wanted to go was...

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:55.562
Of course,
where I can dry my clothes!

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:57.659
Where did you think it was?

00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:00.361
Uh...well... it was...

00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:05.639
I knew it was
too good to be true...

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:08.078
I wonder what this is.

00:09:08.446 --> 00:09:10.880
Good! This will work!

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.980
Here! Put this on.
It's too cold to stay naked, isn't it?

00:09:15.787 --> 00:09:17.755
Ah...no. Not really...

00:09:17.822 --> 00:09:18.846
Stop.

00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:20.652
Stop it. I have no inclination...

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.249
Never mind...never mind...

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.628
It looks good on you!

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:26.658
Does it, really?

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:29.695
Here's the next one.

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:31.199
What?

00:09:32.337 --> 00:09:35.238
Whoa! Look what's in here...
this and that...

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.429
Umm...excuse me...

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:37.906
- Here. Hold this in your hand.
- What?!

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:39.910
Oh, take your pants off
and put this on.

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:41.171
- Put this on, too.
- You mean...this is...

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:42.837
- Here! This and this and...
- Um...hey, hey...

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:47.715
Ah...this is...

00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:50.212
Let me see.
That looks pretty good.

00:09:50.422 --> 00:09:52.890
You look great
and kind of kinky...

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:58.495
Could this girl...

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.064
...with such a cute,
innocent face...

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:01.597
...have abnormal taste?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.490
What should you do,
Eikichi Onizuka?

00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:04.967
You're 22 years old.

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:07.732
Is it all right to step into...
the forbidden territory?

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:09.706
Of course, there may never be
another chance like this!

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:11.742
I should muster up
all my courage and...

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.344
- Wait!
- What?

00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:22.683
Please help me kill some time.

00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:25.517
I have 60 or 70 long
and chillingly boring years...

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:29.523
... remaining in my life.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:30.595
What?

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:36.231
Someone!

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.230
- Hey...hey!
- Help!

00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:39.861
What's wrong?

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:43.563
That pervert...to me...to me...

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:45.208
What? That guy?

00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:47.174
- Hey, you! You're under arrest!
- What?

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:49.509
Ah, no...no, no...this is...
Ha ha ha! Whoa!

00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:54.013
I'm sorry.

00:10:56.054 --> 00:10:58.386
Hey! Hold it!

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:22.699
Hey, isn't Onizuka
extremely irritated today?

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:24.769
Why wouldn't he be?

00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:27.005
But it's not like him
to get arrested...

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:29.172
...especially on suspicion
of molestation.

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:31.679
But I heard that
the victim disappeared.

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.583
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have been released.

00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:36.318
He insists he was set up...

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:38.186
...but I heard he was
in his underwear...

00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:40.316
...and he had all kinds
of kinky props.

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:42.553
Does it mean
he is guilty, then?

00:11:42.729 --> 00:11:44.458
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was.

00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:47.797
Stop making that sound!

00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:49.525
We'll believe you!

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:51.361
Don't take it out on us!

00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:53.537
Stop it!

00:11:57.343 --> 00:12:00.437
A healthy spirit resides
in a healthy body!

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.072
Come on. Put more spirit into it!
Three more rounds!

00:12:04.884 --> 00:12:06.579
Raise your thighs higher!

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:08.283
Good morning!

00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:10.386
Huh? Good morning?

00:12:10.957 --> 00:12:12.822
What time do you think...

00:12:17.664 --> 00:12:21.623
I swear the girl approached me
saying she was my fan.

00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:24.302
Who would believe
such a ridiculous story?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.630
I'm telling you the truth!

00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:28.506
But that girl
called me a pervert...

00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:31.576
...out of the blue...
and ran away.

00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.944
She set me up...

00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:38.983
I see. What a horrible girl...
to deceive you, Teacher.

00:12:39.152 --> 00:12:41.677
That's right. You understand...

00:12:44.924 --> 00:12:45.913
Yoo-hoo!

00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:50.758
You wench!
The girl from yesterday!

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:52.296
Urumi Kanzaki!

00:12:52.598 --> 00:12:53.895
What did you come here for?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.797
For what?
Because I belong in this class.

00:12:55.868 --> 00:12:58.029
Kanzaki...why?

00:12:58.104 --> 00:13:00.231
Don't lie to me. You told me
you were 19 last night!

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.668
It's true.

00:13:01.808 --> 00:13:03.002
Right.

00:13:04.677 --> 00:13:05.871
URUMI KANZAKI

00:13:06.045 --> 00:13:07.342
See?

00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:10.539
I've been absent
for quite some time.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.948
But I'll start coming
to school for a while.

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:15.052
So, Yoroshiku
(thank you in advance).

00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:16.447
Don't be cheeky!

00:13:16.622 --> 00:13:20.752
You called me a pervert,
and I had to go through hell!

00:13:20.893 --> 00:13:22.155
What? Is that true?

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.324
All I said was...

00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:26.523
"Someone!"

00:13:26.766 --> 00:13:27.960
"That man!"

00:13:28.134 --> 00:13:29.795
Just those three words.

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.703
I never used the word "pervert."

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:34.801
What?!

00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.002
A King Cobra!
How cute!

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.635
Are you trying
to change the subject?

00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:41.771
Do you think I will...

00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:48.183
Noooo!

00:13:48.287 --> 00:13:49.515
He's clamped on!

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.520
...on my...my....

00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:53.891
Someone! Someone!

00:13:55.495 --> 00:13:57.224
What's wrong?
Onizuka-sensei!

00:13:57.897 --> 00:14:00.832
A King...Cobra...
deadly poison...

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:03.863
It's a King Cobra!
With deadly poison!

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.397
Someone! Get it off of me!
Fuyutsuki!

00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:07.800
Nooo!

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.498
What's all the fuss about?

00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:12.772
Help me, Principal! This!..

00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:14.344
This!

00:14:14.413 --> 00:14:16.108
Fuyutsuki-sensei,
give me that pair of scissors!

00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:17.844
Here they are!

00:14:18.684 --> 00:14:20.447
What are you going to do?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.078
The only thing we can do is
to cut it off...

00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:23.713
... before the poison
goes all over his body.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.757
What?

00:14:24.891 --> 00:14:26.017
Um...excuse me.

00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:28.287
We can't waste even a second!

00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:30.420
Everyone, hold Onizuka-sensei tight.

00:14:30.897 --> 00:14:32.364
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:35.726
Wait... please...
I've never used it!

00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:37.861
And you're gonna cut it off?
That's too cruel!

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.063
Is it more important
than your life?

00:14:41.007 --> 00:14:42.998
I don't want to lose
either of them!

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:45.006
Hey, let go!
I'm telling you to let go!

00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:48.173
Excuse me, Onizuka-sensei.
Move your hands over!

00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:50.579
I don't want to!
No!

00:14:50.783 --> 00:14:52.250
What?

00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:54.478
This is...

00:14:57.256 --> 00:15:00.157
It's a Japanese rat snake...
it's not poisonous.

00:15:01.327 --> 00:15:03.818
So, it was a fake King Cobra.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.428
Gosh, simple as that!

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:08.767
I...I've survived...

00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:10.527
Phew.

00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:13.595
But who in the world thought
of such an elaborate trick...

00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:16.207
It must be that girl!
Urumi Kanzaki!

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:18.368
- What?
- Kanzaki?

00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:21.741
Bad news!

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:24.382
Urumi Kanzaki came to school!

00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:27.883
Who's teaching
the next class in 3-4?

00:15:28.354 --> 00:15:29.378
Umm...

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:31.682
It's me...

00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:35.023
Uh...what is it?

00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:40.489
Kanzaki...

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:41.928
What? Kikuchi...

00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:43.468
...it's been a long time...

00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:45.560
What have you come here for?

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.336
What do you mean, "What?"

00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:50.034
It's natural for a student
to come to school, isn't it?

00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:52.704
I'm sure Aizawa or someone
asked you to come.

00:15:53.512 --> 00:15:57.039
Miyabi only told me that
there was an interesting teacher.

00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:00.810
He seems really interesting.

00:16:02.355 --> 00:16:04.414
I think I'll be able to
kill some time with him.

00:16:04.857 --> 00:16:06.119
Kanzaki!

00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:07.351
All rise!

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:11.453
Bow!

00:16:12.498 --> 00:16:14.398
Be seated!

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:17.167
So, you must be...

00:16:17.837 --> 00:16:19.429
Urumi Kanzaki!

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:22.301
I'm sorry I've been
absent until today.

00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:24.334
Oh, it's all right.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.436
If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to ask.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.842
Yes!

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:31.875
Since teachers were warning me
so much about her...

00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:34.019
... I thought she'd be
more outrageous...

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:37.051
...but she looks like
an ordinary, gentle kid.

00:16:38.024 --> 00:16:39.286
CONFUCIUS

00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:41.724
Confucius says, "Study
at the right time and acquire it.

00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:43.591
"What a pleasure it is.

00:16:43.663 --> 00:16:45.722
"Friends come to visit from afar.

00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:47.162
"What a pleasure it is.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.597
"Unless you know the person well...

00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:50.192
"...do not have negative thoughts
towards them.

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:51.327
This is the virtue of a wise man."

00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:52.529
CHINESE CLASSICS III

00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:54.095
In short, what Confucius
wanted to teach was...

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:56.037
...that to study
and acquire knowledge...

00:16:56.108 --> 00:16:58.668
...by reviewing at the right time
is such a pleasure.

00:16:59.312 --> 00:17:02.679
Also, what a pleasure it is...

00:17:02.748 --> 00:17:06.013
...to welcome a friend from afar
with the same aspirations.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:10.049
Now, let's have someone
read the next sentence.

00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:11.514
Teacher!

00:17:12.258 --> 00:17:13.520
Ah, then, Kanzaki-san.

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:17.186
Yes. Ah, before that,
I'd like to ask a question.

00:17:17.763 --> 00:17:19.321
Sure. What is it?

00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:21.628
If you say Confucius' words...

00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:23.464
... in their original language,
it goes like this...

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:34.678
Isn't it?

00:17:34.747 --> 00:17:37.944
But Confucius was
the very first scholar in China.

00:17:38.017 --> 00:17:39.985
When you take
the historical background...

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.883
...of his time
into consideration...

00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:43.854
...I think it is more natural
to interpret...

00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:47.051
...the Chinese character "Study"
as acquiring manners...

00:17:47.226 --> 00:17:48.784
...suitable for noblemen.

00:17:49.662 --> 00:17:51.687
In other words, the part you said
was "to study at the right time"...

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:53.231
...could refer to social events
throughout the year.

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:54.766
The part about friends visiting
refers to welcoming and entertaining...

00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:56.301
... important guests from other villages
at those events.

00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:57.836
Also, the part about not knowing
the person and negative thoughts...

00:17:57.903 --> 00:17:59.370
...could be interpreted
as working behind the scenes...

00:17:59.472 --> 00:18:00.496
...at those events and rituals...

00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:02.097
...without complaining
about the hard work.

00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:03.232
That is what
a true wise man would do.

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:05.207
What do you think
of this interpretation?

00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.243
RESIGNATION

00:18:08.247 --> 00:18:10.647
Whoa! Fuyutsuki!

00:18:10.783 --> 00:18:12.683
What are you doing,
submitting a letter of resignation?

00:18:12.752 --> 00:18:13.844
Leave me alone!

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.317
I'd rather die...

00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:18.482
...than not be able to answer
a question from a student!

00:18:18.624 --> 00:18:22.720
- Calm down. Cool down!
- It's O.K. I'm just a...just a...

00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:26.556
Fuyutsuki.

00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:28.766
These are Kanzaki's tactics.

00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:29.801
What?

00:18:30.069 --> 00:18:31.093
She is...

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.264
...to say the least,
a trickster, but, anyway...

00:18:35.674 --> 00:18:38.472
She makes it impossible
for a teacher to continue teaching.

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:40.104
There are times...

00:18:40.246 --> 00:18:43.181
...when she asks questions
that a teacher just can't answer.

00:18:43.449 --> 00:18:46.418
Other times she starts
some sort of trouble.

00:18:47.753 --> 00:18:50.620
So, the snake that bit
into my thing was her...

00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:53.148
But there is no proof.

00:18:53.225 --> 00:18:54.351
That's...

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.655
Anyway, she plays all kinds
of tricks to harass teachers...

00:18:56.729 --> 00:18:59.289
...without leaving any evidence.

00:18:59.365 --> 00:19:02.459
That's Urumi Kanzaki's
classroom terrorism.

00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:04.432
There are teachers who left...

00:19:04.503 --> 00:19:06.801
... because they had
lost confidence...

00:19:06.872 --> 00:19:09.067
Classroom terrorism?
That's ridiculous!

00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.868
HARDCORE DRILL SERGEANT

00:19:12.144 --> 00:19:14.704
I don't care whether it's terrorism
or berrorism (bero = tongue).

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.771
There's no reason
we shouldn't do anything...

00:19:16.849 --> 00:19:18.544
... if we already know
that much.

00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:20.652
I'll make her understand!

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.909
Hmm!

00:19:22.188 --> 00:19:23.951
Ah... Onizuka-sensei, but...

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.817
Just leave it to me!

00:19:25.925 --> 00:19:28.519
No! She is special!
Sensei!

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:30.656
Kanzaki!

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.069
Don't you think your tricks
are a little over the line?

00:19:37.136 --> 00:19:40.936
Even gentle teachers
have their limits!

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.401
What are you talking about?

00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:44.909
Urumi doesn't understand!

00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:47.707
Don't tell me
you don't understand.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.839
You tried to let a cobra
eat my crotch...

00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:51.439
... made Fuyutsuki cry and...Ah!

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.710
Come with me for a minute!

00:19:54.186 --> 00:19:55.312
Whoa!

00:19:57.857 --> 00:19:59.722
I will hang you upside down...

00:19:59.892 --> 00:20:02.656
...and lower you
into the pool and...

00:20:02.728 --> 00:20:04.195
Onizuka-sensei.
Please stop.

00:20:04.263 --> 00:20:05.252
Fuyutsuki.

00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:07.762
Don't worry about me.

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:09.801
It's my fault
I haven't studied enough...

00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:12.994
If you are this lenient,
students like her won't understand!

00:20:13.072 --> 00:20:14.232
Are you listening?

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.707
Wait!

00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:17.867
Anyway, I'm gonna punish you
until you cry so hard that....

00:20:17.943 --> 00:20:19.171
Hey, Onizuka!

00:20:19.245 --> 00:20:20.371
What is it this time?

00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:22.538
What in the world are you doing?

00:20:22.982 --> 00:20:24.677
Please keep quiet.

00:20:24.984 --> 00:20:27.544
I am preaching to her
as a mere teacher...

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.982
This is outrageous!

00:20:29.054 --> 00:20:31.079
She is special!
Don't you know?

00:20:31.223 --> 00:20:33.748
Ah...Take your dirty hands
off of her!

00:20:33.893 --> 00:20:36.384
Listen! We watch over her...

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:38.895
...as a special student
from the Ministry of Education.

00:20:38.964 --> 00:20:39.988
What the hell is that?

00:20:40.432 --> 00:20:44.198
This girl, Urumi Kanzaki,
is a super-genius with an IQ over 200.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.761
There are less than a handful
of them in the entire world.

00:20:46.872 --> 00:20:47.998
Do you understand?

00:20:48.874 --> 00:20:50.637
200...IQ?

00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:52.403
So what?

00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:55.478
She has an official guarantee
to go to any university freely.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:59.548
She is the star of our school,
so to speak.

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:02.946
So, if anything
should happen to her...

00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:06.182
Firing you won't be enough.

00:21:06.258 --> 00:21:08.419
Please treat her
with utmost caution!

00:21:09.662 --> 00:21:14.031
Yoroshiku! Onizuka-sen-sei,
my homeroom teacher!

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.432
Yoroshiku!

00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:22.440
I'm telling you to stop THAT!
Hold him down!

00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:26.273
Class 3-4 Homeroom teacher.

00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:28.607

00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:16.659
Huh?

00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:29.068
I know teachers abandon
students in a time of crisis.
