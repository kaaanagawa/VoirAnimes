WEBVTT

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:11.301
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:17.093
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:23.529
This street makes me love

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.268
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:33.270
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:38.813
Cars don't look like they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:43.714
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.824
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.026
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.434 --> 00:01:00.235
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:05.904
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:11.373
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:19.786
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:22.452
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.520
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:41.885
Wow! So many stars!

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.982
We hardly ever see
them like this in Tokyo.

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:46.934
Beautiful...

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:49.802
You are more beautiful.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.092
Why are you trying
to be so smooth?

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:54.182
You're just Yoshikawa!

00:01:57.203 --> 00:01:58.170
Uehara-san.

00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:59.238
What is it...?

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:03.077
To tell you the truth,
for a long time...

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:04.214
(I've loved you. )

00:02:04.314 --> 00:02:05.440
I'VE LOVED YOU

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:07.973
I WANT YOU...

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:09.416
It's too soon!

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:11.778
I'm not mentally prepared yet...

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.220
I'm not ready..!

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:21.131
A dream...

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:24.020
Why am I dreaming
about Yoshikawa?!

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:38.797
Good morning.

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:42.568
Why are you videotaping your
students?! You're a pervert!

00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:45.972
It's a success!

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.146
Hey! Wait!

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:49.977
I've got a good one!

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:53.645
Hey! Wait..!

00:02:57.824 --> 00:02:58.984
Good morning, Uehara-san!

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:01.185
Good morning...

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:04.459
Why am I avoiding eye contact?

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.368
What are you doing up
this early in the morning?

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.377
I couldn't sleep.
So I went for a walk.

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:13.447
The sunrise is really beautiful.

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:14.946
Why don't you come
and see it, too?

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:19.545
Why do I have to go to see
the sunrise with you?

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.058
What's the matter, Anko?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.397
Nothing!

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.062
Why am I thinking of him?

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:33.858
That wimp!

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.800
It's because I had
a little scare last night...

00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:38.234
...that's why I had
that weird dream.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:39.897
I WANT YOU...

00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:42.110
That's right! That's it!

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:47.407
No, Vice Principal!

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.083
You have to stay in bed.

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:52.943
How can I stay in bed?

00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:56.846
If something happens
while I'm in bed...

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.185
Don't worry about it.

00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:00.693
There's only one day
left on this school trip.

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:03.397
We're flying back
to Tokyo tomorrow.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:06.662
Leave the students to us.

00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:09.327
Give yourself time to heal.

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.805
Give myself time...

00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:21.282
Come to think of it,
I haven't taken time for myself...

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.384
...in several years.

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:29.023
On weekdays, I oversee
the students and the faculty.

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:31.385
On Sundays I go golfing
for social reasons.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.853
Once in a while
when I sleep in...

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:35.829
...my wife complains about
how late I'm sleeping in...

00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.364
...and sucks my head
with a vacuum cleaner.

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:40.360
In the end,
she assigns me work...

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.768
...like cleaning the bathroom,
weeding, and shining shoes...

00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:46.900
There is no time to get any rest.

00:04:50.245 --> 00:04:53.612
One more day remaining...

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.814
That's right! Only one more day!

00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:57.010
Get some courage and go for it!

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:59.211
But I get so nervous...

00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:00.683
Don't worry about it!

00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:04.024
That's what he's expecting.

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:05.115
What are you talking about?

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.585
Here. Thanks for waiting!

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.597
We're talking about boys!

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.334
We want to have good
memories of this trip.

00:05:14.202 --> 00:05:15.464
So we're thinking
about calling the boys...

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.094
...and telling them
how we feel tonight...

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.107
Are you serious?

00:05:19.207 --> 00:05:20.174
As a matter of fact...

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:21.833
...I already have a meeting
with a boy from Class 1.

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:23.467
Are you coming with us, too?

00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:25.112
Well, I...

00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:26.180
Watch out!

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.250
Did you see my bullet serve?!

00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:31.376
That's too much!

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:32.917
Sorry! Are you all right?

00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:34.782
- Yoshikawa!
- Are you all right, Anko?

00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:36.283
I'm fine.

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:37.925
I'm so sorry...

00:05:38.093 --> 00:05:39.526
Do you think your
apology is enough?

00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:42.393
Because of you,
the frappe is ruined!

00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:44.097
Replace it!

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:46.492
I'm sorry.
I'll get you another one.

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.568
Wait!

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.500
Why don't you
get one for us, too?!

00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:50.805
What?!

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.265
It's common courtesy.

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:53.565
I want Tropical.

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:55.006
Ujikintoki for me! Thanks!

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:57.739
Forget about it!

00:05:58.347 --> 00:06:00.281
It's just a frappe.
There's no need to replace it...

00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:02.274
I wasn't paying attention, either.

00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:04.519
A...Anko?

00:06:05.053 --> 00:06:06.077
Yoshikawa!

00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:07.382
What are you doing?!

00:06:07.522 --> 00:06:09.717
It's your serve!

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:11.186
Hurry up and get back.

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:12.317
The idiot needs you.

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:13.986
Yeah...

00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:15.263
Thank you.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.860
What's going on?

00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:20.529
What do you mean?!

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:23.461
You're being
too nice to Yoshikawa.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.239
What...? No! I'm not!

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:27.808
See, Onizuka's watching.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:29.110
If he finds out...

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.235
...we forced Yoshikawa
to spend money on us...

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:32.006
...I don't know what he'd do...

00:06:32.347 --> 00:06:34.440
She has a good point.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.181
Then why don't we go
back to the room...

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:39.913
...and secretly throw away
Yoshikawa's stuff?

00:06:40.055 --> 00:06:42.023
Good one! He may cry again.

00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:44.888
- Let's not do it...
- What?

00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.721
If his stuff is missing...

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:51.091
...we would be the first suspects.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.028
What's the matter
with you, Anko?

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:54.363
You're acting really weird.

00:06:55.037 --> 00:06:56.698
What happened between
you and Yoshikawa yesterday?

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.397
What are you talking about?!

00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:00.508
Nothing happened!

00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:03.040
Are you, by chance,
in love with Yoshikawa?!

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:04.942
No way! I can't believe it!

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.379
No! Why would I be in love
with such a wimpy guy...?

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:10.308
- That's true...
- What?

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:14.178
There is no way
you could fall in love...

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:16.813
...with that hopeless nerd...

00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:18.423
These guys..!

00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:21.195
A...Anko...?

00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:24.965
What's the matter with her?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.067
I don't know...

00:07:28.203 --> 00:07:29.465
Hmm...

00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:32.370
STAR SAND

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:37.570
Why are they so worried about...

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:38.771
...their memories
of the school trip?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.847
It's so stupid!

00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:42.746
If they want memories,
why don't they buy a Caesar trinket?

00:07:44.252 --> 00:07:45.219
Hey, look!

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.345
It says these sands make
your love wishes come true!

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:48.578
Wow! It does!

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:51.187
How cute!

00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:52.860
I'm gonna buy this!

00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:53.928
This is mine!

00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:57.758
Love wishes come true...

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.466
Hey, Uehara!

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:00.601
What are you looking at?

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:02.260
Are you looking for a souvenir?

00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:05.735
Why are you so jumpy?

00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:09.169
Sand of the stars... Not bad.

00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:11.679
I wasn't looking at them!

00:08:11.913 --> 00:08:14.507
What wish do you
want to come true?

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:15.742
I told you
I wasn't looking at them!

00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:17.917
Don't be embarrassed.

00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:19.714
Why don't you talk to me?

00:08:20.188 --> 00:08:23.021
I'm a PE teacher,
and I'm always ready to listen...

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.457
...to any student
with love troubles.

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:27.594
Don't be ashamed.

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:29.663
Your tears are
the sweat of your heart.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.464
If you run toward
the setting sun, all of your troubles...

00:08:31.566 --> 00:08:33.363
-...will go away!
- I told you, no thank you!

00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:34.435
You're so persistent.

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:37.834
Look at my strength and power...

00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:42.569
Wow! Look at this!

00:08:42.677 --> 00:08:44.542
It says, "Get them as a pair!
Pendants with names."

00:08:44.713 --> 00:08:47.079
Cute! Should I buy them?

00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:49.484
Huh...

00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:53.045
Wow. These have the sand, too.

00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:55.417
Interesting!

00:08:56.558 --> 00:08:58.492
ANKO

00:09:02.831 --> 00:09:03.798
GET A PAIR WITH A BOY!

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.025
Noboru...

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.202
NOBORU

00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:14.531
What am I doing?!

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:17.301
No! You shouldn't rely
on something like this!

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:20.573
If you like him,
you have to tell him so!

00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:22.547
He can't make up his mind.

00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:25.380
So you have to make your move.

00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:26.621
But...

00:09:27.622 --> 00:09:30.113
So put it down. Don't worry.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.193
I'll be cheering for you.

00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:34.553
If you don't tell him how
you're feeling about him...

00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:35.630
...you will regret it.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:39.364
I will...?

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:42.803
Yeah!

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.944
Everyone is acting so giddy!

00:09:51.046 --> 00:09:52.070
It's so stupid...

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:56.503
KIMIGA HOSHII (I WANT YOU)
YATU CHAE (DO IT)

00:09:56.749 --> 00:10:00.116
I have to spend
the last day in Okinawa...

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:02.345
...in my pajamas
in the hospital...

00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:07.722
Hmm. I guess
I can't fight my age.

00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:10.759
I, who was trained
in the mountaineering club...

00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:12.626
...in college... What a pity...

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.101
It's all Onizuka's fault!

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:20.601
If he had not taken the students
to that uninhabited island...

00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:24.164
... I wouldn't have had to chase
them, lose control of the jet ski...

00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:26.744
...and reach Iriomote Island
out of control.

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:29.409
And then end up getting
stuck in that fishing net!

00:10:30.983 --> 00:10:33.577
That Onizuka..!

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:35.413
He should be fired!

00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:38.987
Instead of cutting my travel
and social expenses...

00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:41.855
...he should be laid off.

00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:42.928
Given the current economy...

00:10:43.028 --> 00:10:44.086
... we can't afford to have...

00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:46.027
...such an incompetent
teacher on our staff!!

00:10:51.237 --> 00:10:52.204
Yes?

00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:57.204
I came to say hi.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.242
To see me?
You came all this way?

00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:02.371
I was worried.

00:11:02.848 --> 00:11:04.315
I heard you had fallen down...

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.582
But I'm glad... you look well.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.111
You seem to have energy, too.

00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:10.049
What's happening?

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:12.921
It's been ten years since I had
my last homeroom class...

00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:16.550
There have been no students
who care about me...

00:11:16.862 --> 00:11:19.126
Is it all right to put
away these flowers?

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:20.265
Ah... Yeah...

00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:23.300
What's your name?

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.498
My name is Megumi Asakura.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:26.927
I'm in Class 4.

00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:29.006
I see... Class 4...?

00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:33.636
Class 4 is that idiot
Onizuka's class.

00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:35.005
What does this mean?

00:11:35.114 --> 00:11:36.672
I wonder if he sent...

00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.477
...this female student...

00:11:38.984 --> 00:11:39.951
...as an assassin?

00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:41.453
Cheeky.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.584
I suppose he hid
something in those flowers.

00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:46.825
Maybe a bee... Or a jackknife!

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:50.189
Shoot!
I won't be fooled! Onizuka!

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:55.796
A Kunoichi sent by you
won't take me in!

00:11:58.404 --> 00:12:00.304
Oh, shoot.
I took time to pick these...

00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:05.602
Is this a sexual trap, Onizuka?!

00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:17.379
We want to have good
memories of the school trip.

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:18.922
So we're thinking
about calling the boys...

00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:20.514
...and telling them
how we feel tonight...

00:12:20.926 --> 00:12:22.359
Good memories...

00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:26.893
Why am I thinking
of Yoshikawa now?!

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:32.697
I hate this! There are
so many good-looking boys.

00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:34.429
Why Yoshikawa?!

00:12:36.976 --> 00:12:39.968
Am I really in love
with Yoshikawa...?

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:45.005
What should I do?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.729
I... I'm sorry!

00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:03.266
I didn't know you were
taking a shower... Well...

00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:05.963
Shut up! Get out right now!

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:08.499
- Hurry up! Now!
- Yes!

00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:11.175
Anko! Are you ready...?

00:13:12.878 --> 00:13:14.436
Sorry to disturb you!

00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:16.412
Hey, wait a minute!

00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:18.646
You've misunderstood!

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:25.384
What are you going to do?
They've got the wrong idea!

00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:26.753
I'm sorry!

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:36.601
Yoshikawa...

00:13:37.202 --> 00:13:38.169
What?

00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:40.362
It's the last night in Okinawa.

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:41.837
Aren't you going out?

00:13:42.274 --> 00:13:44.606
Well... Kikuchi's playing
Hanafuda (flower cards)...

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.235
...with Murai and the other guys...

00:13:48.013 --> 00:13:49.674
I see...

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.774
Hey...

00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:55.980
What?

00:13:56.555 --> 00:13:58.921
If you want, we...

00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:00.458
What?

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:03.756
So on our last night
in Okinawa, we could...

00:14:08.534 --> 00:14:09.626
I wonder who it is...

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.495
Is Yoshikawa in?

00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:14.764
Yes...

00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:24.008
If you don't tell him how
you're feeling about him...

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:25.083
...you will regret it.

00:14:25.651 --> 00:14:27.209
Why do I have to...?!

00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:30.811
Well...

00:14:30.923 --> 00:14:31.890
Good luck!

00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:34.025
Uehara-san...?

00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:38.663
Regarding the reports
on this school trip...

00:14:38.764 --> 00:14:41.198
...we'll collect them
in the second term.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.824
As the literary
committee member...

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.333
...please tell your classmates.

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:47.338
Ah...yes.

00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:53.044
This is so stupid!
Why am I getting so serious?

00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:56.039
It's just Yoshikawa!

00:14:56.381 --> 00:14:58.281
Whoever he goes out with
has nothing to do with me!

00:14:58.784 --> 00:14:59.876
Uehara-san.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.384
What are you doing?!

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:13.296
You like Yoshikawa, don't you?!

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:14.762
What are you talking about?!

00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:17.433
Oh, no! Yoshikawa...

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:20.862
Yoshikawa... No!
I'm not mentally prepared.

00:15:21.607 --> 00:15:22.665
You're the worst!

00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:26.206
That camera is
worth 148,000 yen!

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.107
It's the vice principal's, though...

00:15:28.213 --> 00:15:30.477
Shut up, you perverted teacher!

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:31.741
I'll expose you on the TV show!

00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:36.450
My ideal is a wild guy
like Brad Pitt!

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:39.557
There is no way
I could fall in love...

00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:41.285
...with a wimpy guy
like Yoshikawa!

00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:45.086
What? Do you want
to say something?

00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:46.598
Do you want to say
a man shouldn't be judged...

00:15:46.698 --> 00:15:47.665
...by his appearance
or something?

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:51.668
No... Yoshikawa
is certainly a wimp.

00:15:52.304 --> 00:15:54.772
He is short, and he isn't strong.

00:15:55.207 --> 00:15:56.731
No athletic ability.

00:15:57.376 --> 00:15:59.640
Even the girls pick on him...

00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:01.807
...and he isn't circumcised.

00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:04.647
He doesn't even have
any hair down there...

00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:07.947
And he's not smart, either.

00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:10.414
His appeal as a male is zero...

00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:14.151
What? You don't
need to say all that...

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.927
You aren't honest
with your feelings.

00:16:17.362 --> 00:16:18.386
Right, Uehara?

00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:21.162
You can't have a love affair...

00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:24.963
...if you don't show
your true feelings.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:31.231
A brat who is afraid to be hurt
isn't qualified to love someone.

00:16:31.443 --> 00:16:33.570
I don't care about Yoshikawa!

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.172
What is it?!

00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:38.440
You're an extremely
twisted woman.

00:16:40.352 --> 00:16:43.651
All right! I will thoroughly
straighten you out.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.788
Leave it to me! All right?!

00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:51.959
What a refreshing feeling!

00:16:52.364 --> 00:16:54.992
It's been a while since I've
had a feeling of satisfaction...

00:16:57.002 --> 00:16:58.333
What a dirty trick, Onizuka!

00:16:58.437 --> 00:17:00.462
Although I went to the club
and requested...

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.800
...the roles of a teacher
and his female student...

00:17:02.908 --> 00:17:04.273
...don't underestimate me..!

00:17:04.509 --> 00:17:08.502
This won't tempt me..!

00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:12.716
Well, teacher...

00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:14.709
Do you remember me?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.954
What...what are
you talking about?

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.023
How could I remember you...?

00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:21.353
Like I thought,
you don't remember...

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.594
...the thing you
told me that time...

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.322
I don't know!
I didn't say anything!

00:17:26.431 --> 00:17:28.228
I don't know
which club you belong to...

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:30.267
...but it isn't legally binding...

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:34.299
You told me a story
about a sunflower...

00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:38.369
You don't remember it...

00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:41.571
I was very moved at that time...

00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:45.143
I was a transfer student...

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.017
...and I had no friends...

00:17:47.886 --> 00:17:50.218
I was so sad
that I wanted to cry.

00:17:50.889 --> 00:17:52.117
During the break...

00:17:52.391 --> 00:17:56.657
...I often sat alone in front
of the sunflower beds.

00:17:57.462 --> 00:18:01.330
Then you came
to me and said...

00:18:02.534 --> 00:18:04.092
... "Do you know...

00:18:04.202 --> 00:18:06.466
... why the sunflower
is called a Sunflower?"

00:18:07.372 --> 00:18:10.569
"It's because it always
blooms toward the sun. "

00:18:11.143 --> 00:18:12.633
"When the sun goes east,
it faces to the east...

00:18:12.978 --> 00:18:14.468
...and when it is in the west,
it faces to the west. "

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.939
"It's a flower that looks
for the sun and blooms. "

00:18:17.683 --> 00:18:20.584
"It blooms as a smiling
yellow flower every day. "

00:18:21.954 --> 00:18:25.720
"So if you're having a bad day,
you can come here...

00:18:25.991 --> 00:18:28.755
...and talk to
the sunflowers every day. "

00:18:29.361 --> 00:18:32.626
"Then you'll be fine. "

00:18:32.931 --> 00:18:35.263
Those words opened my eyes!

00:18:35.968 --> 00:18:39.028
I thought the flowers
had defeated me, too.

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:44.671
So since then I always try
to smile like those sunflowers.

00:18:44.843 --> 00:18:46.970
Then I made many friends!

00:18:48.213 --> 00:18:50.545
All because of you!

00:18:50.916 --> 00:18:53.180
You gave me courage.

00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:56.452
Someday
I want to be a teacher...

00:18:56.555 --> 00:18:59.115
... who can give courage
to others like you did.

00:19:02.327 --> 00:19:04.591
I'm a little embarrassed
to have admitted this to you...

00:19:05.263 --> 00:19:06.855
So I'm leaving.

00:19:10.335 --> 00:19:12.803
Please get well soon
and inspire me again.

00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:13.893
Excuse me!

00:19:18.276 --> 00:19:21.040
What am I doing?

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.439
Doubting the student?

00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:27.215
When things don't go well,
I hate the students...

00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:30.321
...and I hate
my colleagues and society.

00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:34.820
I'm the bad one, because
I cannot trust other people!

00:19:35.527 --> 00:19:38.587
Where did that man go,
who came through the gate...

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.961
...29 years ago with ideals
and hope for education...?

00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:47.705
I'll start again
from the beginning.

00:19:48.807 --> 00:19:50.707
Go back to that time...

00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:53.174
... when I was pure
as a teacher and as a person!

00:19:53.412 --> 00:19:55.004
As a teacher!

00:19:57.616 --> 00:20:00.676
It's our last night in Okinawa...

00:20:00.786 --> 00:20:04.153
...so how did I get stuck
looking after the vice principal?

00:20:04.623 --> 00:20:06.523
Onizuka-sensei has
disappeared, too...

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.349
Excuse me!

00:20:11.596 --> 00:20:14.565
Fuyutsuki-sensei.
I'm going back now.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:17.294
But what about your condition?

00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:20.262
It's all right. See? I'm fine!

00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:22.106
And...

00:20:22.908 --> 00:20:25.604
Right now,
I feel like I'm born again.

00:20:26.178 --> 00:20:28.112
The best medicine
for a teacher is...

00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.974
...to see the students'
bright smiles.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.542
Vice Principal...

00:20:33.618 --> 00:20:34.778
Let's go...

00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:37.118
Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.653
I've been looking all over for you.
You've been here all this time?

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.023
I have something
I need your help with.

00:20:44.329 --> 00:20:46.160
The vice principal is...

00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:48.299
Don't worry about him.
Please help me.

00:20:54.172 --> 00:20:55.764
Onizuka!

00:20:59.077 --> 00:21:01.671
Get up! Everyone, get up!

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.080
Get up! Get up!

00:21:04.516 --> 00:21:06.279
What's going on?

00:21:06.952 --> 00:21:08.419
It's the middle of the night!

00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:10.316
Leave me alone...

00:21:10.655 --> 00:21:12.088
What's going on?

00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:16.027
Idiots! You're students!
Can't you stay up late?!

00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:18.955
Hey, hey! Get up! Now!

00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:20.994
It's our last night in Okinawa...

00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:23.590
...and the special event
begins right now!

00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:30.374
Special event? What is he...?

00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:32.343
Could he be...?!

00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:54.153
Where is our future going?

00:21:54.262 --> 00:22:00.997
Maybe it knows of this aimless
journey and simply flew away

00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:08.274
If you can stop our gloomy days

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:15.346
I will listen to all you say

00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:23.015
However much we have,
There is always something lacking

00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:29.493
The wind will always blow
And carry the scent away

00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:37.367
I am searching for our future now

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:44.035
Don't laugh because
It may really go away

00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:51.782
Remember these
Strained words I say

00:22:52.854 --> 00:22:58.952
The night is almost over,
So let's run through this moment

00:22:59.494 --> 00:23:02.190
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:06.294
All we have is this precious moment

00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:10.262
Before the endless night begins

00:23:10.772 --> 00:23:14.868
Embrace this precious night

00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:17.011
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:18.079
I want you in pairs!

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:20.712
Pairs of boys and girls?!

00:23:25.453 --> 00:23:26.420
Leave her alone!

00:23:37.132 --> 00:23:39.225
I can't help loving him!

00:23:44.372 --> 00:23:45.896
Sea turtle!

00:23:46.074 --> 00:23:53.947
SEE YA NEXT TIME
