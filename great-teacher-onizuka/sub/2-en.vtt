WEBVTT

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:21.121
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.793
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.559
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:38.004
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.837
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.743
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:54.147
Let's cut loose until
We reach our limit

00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:59.185
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.654
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.300
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.630
Toward the finish line

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:41.201
I am standing in front
of the building...

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:44.702
... where the employment exam
for teachers...

00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.000
... took place.

00:01:47.243 --> 00:01:48.301
Hey!

00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:51.679
I ended up coming here
because I was bored.

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:54.509
Weren't you supposed
to take an exam today?

00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.685
Exam? What the hell is that?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.117
Don't you have to take
an exam to become a teacher?

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:03.256
That's what an amateur would think!

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.059
If you're a favorite,
you automatically--

00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:10.562
I learned you need more than
student teaching to become a teacher.

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.769
Right. You need to pass this exam...

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.528
...to become a public school teacher.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.568
It's given for those
becoming teachers...

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.243
...but don't have the knowledge.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.468
Airhead.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.173
Okay, the next news....

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:36.150
It's over. Everything....

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.656
Goodbye, high school girls
in miniskirts.

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:42.092
Goodbye, dangerous
extracurricular classes.

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:47.098
I'm gonna die.
It takes just one shot.

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:54.070
Hey, Eikichi. Are you okay?
Come on, hang in there!

00:02:58.348 --> 00:02:59.838
Ryuji?

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.442
Just forget it.

00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:06.417
Teachers don't get paid much
and their career is full of troubles.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:10.922
If you want to find a girl,
it doesn't have to be at school.

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.362
You will find lots.
Do you want to work with me?

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.296
I think that selling used cars
to individuals would be good.

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:24.974
If we import from America,
we'll make megabucks.

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:30.470
Are you listening?
Let's pair up just like before.

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:33.912
Sorry, Ryuji.

00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:41.015
Having tried student teaching...

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.886
...I realized that
I am not the teacher type.

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:47.119
I get sleepy reading textbooks.

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:49.888
Other teachers annoy me.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.829
I truly realized...

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.500
...I am no different from those kids.

00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:07.806
-Here.
-What is it?

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.543
It's an application
for a teaching position.

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:16.418
You can be a teacher at a private
school even if you fail that exam.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.561
-Ryuji!
-Don't thank me. We are buddies.

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:24.399
I'm gonna be sick.

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:27.296
Hold it! There is
a bathroom right there!

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.062
No! Swallow it. That's gross!

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:34.333
What are you doing?
On my clothes!

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:37.771
Don't be nervous, Eikichi.

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:39.777
I don't care if
they are distinguished.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:42.951
This is my last chance.
I'll impress them at the interview.

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.250
I'm sorry.

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:49.817
Wow, she is hot.

00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:52.586
She is about my age.

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.297
She is wearing jeans. Too bad.

00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:58.763
But her tight hipline....

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.138
What an old pervert!

00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:18.183
The movement of the bus!

00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:28.521
It's a misunderstanding! This is
bodily injury! I'll sue you.

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:32.963
So sue me! Eurasia University,
karate varsity team, Eikichi Onizuka.

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:34.692
I will not run or hide.

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:37.429
I am a man of high social standing.

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:41.508
If you want to press more false
charges, let's call the police.

00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:45.312
It's absolutely unacceptable! You punk!

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.917
Thank you very much. You saved me!

00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:57.888
No, no. I did what I should have done.

00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.857
She is so cute!
Could this be destiny?

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.726
Holy Forest Academy

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:06.799
This must be destiny!

00:06:07.203 --> 00:06:10.969
Really. Someone at the
same interview as me...

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:13.266
...drove that pervert away.

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:17.239
This coincidence makes
my heart beat faster.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.710
Does it really?

00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:26.618
LOVE LOVE
FUYUTSUKI ONIZUKA

00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:30.252
Who did this?
Who pulled such a prank?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.121
Onizuka-sensei is blushing!

00:06:34.864 --> 00:06:36.695
Onizuka-sensei.

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.929
What is this?
I can't believe it!

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:41.830
Look, Fuyutsuki-sensei is blushing too.

00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:44.062
Okay, let's start class!

00:06:44.307 --> 00:06:45.296
Yes, sir.

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:50.270
A love affair with a teacher
at work may not be too bad.

00:06:51.948 --> 00:06:56.078
What a wonderful future!
I am so lucky.

00:06:56.352 --> 00:07:01.051
If that's the case, I need them
to hire me, no matter what!

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.087
Next, please!

00:07:06.262 --> 00:07:08.890
Number 23, Eikichi Onizuka coming in.

00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:17.695
I am Uchiyamada,
the vice principal.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.933
Nice to meet you, Eurasia University,
karate varsity team, Onizuka-kun.

00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:25.646
-What are you doing?
-A banzai cheer.

00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:27.405
Interesting.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.517
Well, your self-promoting
comments say:

00:07:30.753 --> 00:07:34.052
"I am very serious.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.350
That's what people say...

00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:41.088
...but I am actually very sociable...

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.731
...and I have many friends.
That's what people say.

00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:55.341
Also, I am very athletic.

00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:58.240
I can lift 150 kg. on the bench press.

00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:03.885
I was the captain of
the karate varsity team in college.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.581
I would like to take advantage of
these skills in my teaching career."

00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:19.398
Onizuka-kun, instead of applying
for a teaching position here...

00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:22.536
...you should interview
at our middle school.

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:26.469
No, maybe elementary school.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.541
It's pathetic.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:33.476
The chairperson of the school board
has a policy of hiring teachers...

00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:37.880
...without too much emphasis
on their resumes.

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:41.423
But because of that,
airheads like him...

00:08:41.724 --> 00:08:45.057
...show up at the interviews.

00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:56.835
All he has is stamina. He doesn't
even have basic levels of knowledge.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.368
It's a shame that such a bonehead
would show up to interview...

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.908
...at such a distinguished school.

00:09:06.482 --> 00:09:08.006
Thank you for coming.

00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.709
This place is not for trash like you.

00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:13.683
What trash?!

00:09:14.223 --> 00:09:18.159
What? Didn't you hear me
telling you to go?

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:22.831
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's a very rebellious look.

00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:26.330
That's not a look
a teacher should have.

00:09:26.602 --> 00:09:29.002
It's the look of a murderer.

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:32.799
I wouldn't be surprised.
Have you killed one or two?

00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:34.600
Shall I call 9-1-1?

00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:37.074
Don't mock me, you old pervert!

00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:41.016
Who is trash?

00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.415
I can't stand it
when someone calls me...

00:09:46.222 --> 00:09:49.089
...trash! You bastard!

00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:51.384
What are you mumbling about?

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:55.330
Well....

00:09:55.798 --> 00:09:57.823
Nothing!

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:05.006
How was it, Onizuka-kun?

00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:10.738
Onizuka-kun?

00:10:11.013 --> 00:10:14.244
Goodbye, thrilling times
with female students.

00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:17.475
Goodbye, love affair
with a female teacher.

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:21.554
STUDENT STORE

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:23.918
So much for destiny.

00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:28.593
I had no idea that bastard
was the vice principal here.

00:10:30.132 --> 00:10:33.431
Lady, give me a bottle of milk coffee.

00:10:33.703 --> 00:10:35.068
Sure.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:44.270
What's wrong?
Did the interview go wrong?

00:10:44.513 --> 00:10:49.473
Can't you tell? Maybe trash like me
can't become a teacher.

00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:53.712
A young person like you shouldn't
be calling yourself trash.

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:55.819
But....

00:10:56.459 --> 00:11:00.589
Ever since I was a kid, teachers
would call me stupid and trash.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.163
It makes you believe that you are.

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:08.003
I wonder why teachers are like that.

00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:11.138
I know I am stupid and quick to fight.

00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:13.901
I may not be suited to be a teacher.

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:16.907
But if I became a teacher,
I'd never do that.

00:11:17.146 --> 00:11:21.412
I would never call my students trash.

00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.354
Was that too corny?

00:11:33.229 --> 00:11:36.460
Where is the vice principal?
Come out here!

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:39.065
We're gonna kill him! Uchiyamada!

00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:40.360
What is it?

00:11:40.603 --> 00:11:44.232
They used to be in our school.
They were expelled.

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:51.302
-Did they come to get revenge?
-Why don't you stop them?

00:11:51.647 --> 00:11:56.243
If you do a good job, you might
be able to become a teacher.

00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:03.589
I will never let you
off the hook, Uchiyamada!

00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:07.353
You've made a fool out of me
too many times!

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:10.292
Bastards! We'll call the police.

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:12.899
-Shut up!
-Wait!

00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:14.295
Who are you?

00:12:14.837 --> 00:12:17.169
Harming him will not
be tolerated by me...

00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:21.866
...Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old,
interview number 23.

00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.602
Weren't you a captain
of the karate team?

00:12:24.847 --> 00:12:30.217
If you get rid of them, I'll give
thought to offering you a position.

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:32.714
What are you guys mumbling about?

00:12:32.955 --> 00:12:37.016
Shut up, you trash! Onizuka-kun,
what do you think they did?

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:42.390
Blackmail, racketeering.
They dishonored our school name!

00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:45.259
It's not like we wanted
to become rebels.

00:12:45.735 --> 00:12:49.262
Every time you saw us,
you called us trash and dropouts!

00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:52.167
What's wrong with calling trash, trash?

00:12:52.408 --> 00:12:57.038
Or are you saying that it is my fault
that you guys went astray?

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.712
That's a bad joke.

00:12:58.948 --> 00:13:03.385
You guys are nothing
but rotten, unredeemable trash!

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:07.622
Onizuka-kun, do something!
You are allowed to beat them up.

00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:10.826
Those pieces of trash are not
our students anymore.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.724
What are you doing, Onizuka-kun?
Act quickly!

00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:21.595
Hey, why are you holding on to me?

00:13:21.837 --> 00:13:26.433
Didn't you hear me, Onizuka-kun?
Do it quickly!

00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:32.305
Unbelievable!

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:40.154
Vice principal!

00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:44.057
That's outrageous!
Did you say you want to be a teacher?

00:13:44.465 --> 00:13:46.592
Do you understand what you did?

00:13:46.834 --> 00:13:49.928
It's violence. This is a huge problem!

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.866
Don't you look down on them, bastard!

00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:56.337
You call people trash
like they are things.

00:13:56.577 --> 00:14:00.069
Why is such verbal violence
allowed?

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.312
Because of teachers like you,
these kids are...

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.485
...squeezed out of their safe haven!

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:09.322
If you call this education...

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:13.617
...I don't want to be a teacher.
I gladly decline.

00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:16.522
Let's go.
You're finished here, right?

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:20.162
Hey, wait! You!

00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:27.303
-Hey, let's go, new guy!
-Okay.

00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:46.256
80 kilometers to Aomori.

00:14:46.527 --> 00:14:50.327
-Stay alert and hold on to the wheel.
-Yes, sir!

00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:53.965
Are you really serious about
becoming a truck driver?

00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:56.260
Didn't you want to be a teacher?

00:14:56.503 --> 00:14:58.971
Please stop talking about it.

00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:01.936
I am totally over it.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.876
When I think about it,
the idea was too far-fetched.

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.207
Me? A teacher?

00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:13.347
Now I'm driving routes.
I appreciate your instruction.

00:15:13.587 --> 00:15:19.025
Sure. I will train you to be a
professional driver. Leave it to me.

00:15:26.867 --> 00:15:29.097
-Excuse me.
-Yes, may I help you?

00:15:29.703 --> 00:15:33.605
Excuse me!
I am looking for Eikichi Onizuka.

00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:37.038
His landlord sent me here.

00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.539
Eikichi?

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.048
Hello, this is Eikichi Onizuka...

00:15:47.287 --> 00:15:49.687
...long-distance truck driver.

00:15:50.224 --> 00:15:52.749
Oh, Ryuji, it's you.

00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:57.453
I am sailing through the Akita area
on Tohoku Highway.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:59.899
I'll arrive at Aomori soon.

00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:02.602
What are you going
to do about college?

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:03.803
I'm gonna quit.

00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:07.529
-What about teaching?
-It's okay. I'm done.

00:16:08.308 --> 00:16:12.142
It's not for me.
I'm not suited for teaching.

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:14.870
I will become GDO.

00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:19.017
Great Driver Onizuka.
That's what I'll strive for now.

00:16:19.253 --> 00:16:20.982
So you quit, huh?

00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:24.884
Then there's no use. If you are
in Akita, it's impossible.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:27.286
What are you talking about?

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.723
Someone came from
the Holy Forest Academy.

00:16:29.963 --> 00:16:32.523
If you take the final interview
by 6 p.m. today...

00:16:32.966 --> 00:16:35.196
... they will hire you.

00:16:35.436 --> 00:16:38.462
But you can't come back
from Akita by 6 p.m.

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:44.207
Just do your best where you are now.
Be GDO.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:49.277
Isn't it impossible?
Can he come back in three hours?

00:16:49.516 --> 00:16:50.949
It usually takes 8 hours.

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:53.585
No matter how fast you drive,
three hours is....

00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:57.983
What's wrong?

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:02.954
I can become a teacher
if I return in three hours.

00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:06.961
Sorry to have interrupted.

00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:11.135
He is not the kind of guy
who gives up easily.

00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:15.330
He makes the impossible possible.
That's the kind of guy he is.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.271
No matter what.

00:17:18.178 --> 00:17:22.114
I can. I can. I can.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.786
I can. I can. I can.

00:17:33.193 --> 00:17:36.026
Hey, stupid!
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:44.093
I can be a teacher
if I can get back in 3 hours.

00:17:44.338 --> 00:17:46.238
Move over!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.075
Attention, patrol cars.

00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:55.270
We are chasing a truck
going south on Tohoku Highway.

00:17:55.516 --> 00:17:59.145
Get roadblocks ready
and send additional police!

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.829
Here it comes!

00:18:21.942 --> 00:18:25.537
The truck has run over the barricades
at the Inawa Tollbooth!

00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.254
Holy Forest Academy

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.329
Is anyone here?

00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:52.130
This is Onizuka!
I have come for an interview!

00:18:53.307 --> 00:18:56.276
No one is here? Rats!

00:18:56.577 --> 00:18:59.239
Answer me! Anyone!

00:19:05.052 --> 00:19:07.452
I guess I didn't make it in time.

00:19:07.888 --> 00:19:11.517
I was prepared to get
arrested for speeding.

00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:19.358
Onizuka-kun.

00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:25.801
I was waiting for you.
Let's start the interview.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.201
You? The old lady?

00:19:31.278 --> 00:19:34.042
Where am I? What is this place?

00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:35.748
What?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.312
Why are you...?

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.183
I knew you would come.

00:19:47.127 --> 00:19:50.119
I got it! You said it was
for a teaching position.

00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:53.959
But it's actually
for a store clerk position.

00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:56.894
This is a practical joke.

00:19:57.137 --> 00:19:58.069
CHAIRPERSON'S OFFICE

00:19:58.305 --> 00:20:01.206
This place is...?
You mean.... Wait.

00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:04.137
Welcome to Holy Forest Academy.

00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:06.972
I am Sakurai,
principal of the school board.

00:20:07.214 --> 00:20:09.273
Principal?!
But I saw you at the student store!

00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:11.643
That's my hobby.

00:20:11.885 --> 00:20:16.948
Sometimes I do that to observe people.

00:20:17.224 --> 00:20:19.920
Oh, no! No way! That's not fair!

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.890
You seem to have a lot on your résumé.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.627
You were taken care of
by the police too.

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:32.700
Okay. You are hired!

00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:38.002
You need to read the school brochure
and teacher's manual.

00:20:38.245 --> 00:20:40.736
-Ma'am....
-What is it?

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:43.815
Are you sure? You didn't take
much time to decide.

00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:45.143
Is that strange?

00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:49.185
I've just never passed anything
like this on the first try.

00:20:49.423 --> 00:20:53.154
Be more confident
about yourself, Onizuka-kun.

00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:55.588
But you need to be prepared.

00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:58.662
Our school is considered prestigious.

00:20:58.899 --> 00:21:01.834
But internally
many problems are mounting...

00:21:02.069 --> 00:21:05.800
...such as delinquency, bullying,
problems with the opposite sex...

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:09.634
...violence, even toward teachers.

00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:15.007
It is getting worse each year
and I can hardly handle it myself.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.319
Onizuka-kun, what I want
from you is exactly...

00:21:21.555 --> 00:21:24.888
...what you showed us
the other day. The German suplex.

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:26.888
That strength!

00:21:27.127 --> 00:21:29.857
-German...?
-That's right! That's it!

00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:34.293
That bridge reminds me of Karl Gotch.

00:21:34.935 --> 00:21:38.029
-May I sit down?
-Please.

00:21:39.005 --> 00:21:43.339
You are the only one who can resolve
our problems in a simple way.

00:21:43.577 --> 00:21:47.673
So, as chairperson of the board,
I am asking you...

00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:52.245
...to become a teacher
at our school. Onizuka-kun?

00:21:52.486 --> 00:21:54.818
Or Teacher Onizuka!

00:21:55.055 --> 00:21:57.182
Leave it to me!

00:21:58.058 --> 00:22:01.391
I will perform the perfect
German suplex here.

00:22:01.628 --> 00:22:04.893
Me, Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old.

00:22:15.642 --> 00:22:18.873
Why do you look so confident?

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.773
Teacher Onizuka is born. Hurray!

00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:26.085
Ryuji and Fuyutsuki!

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:27.684
Congratulations!

00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:31.721
We'll teach at the same school.
I look forward to it.

00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:34.085
You mean, you passed too?

00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:37.023
Unlike you, she passed
on her first try.

00:22:37.264 --> 00:22:39.232
You need to thank her.

00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:43.402
If she hadn't let you know,
you wouldn't have gotten the chance.

00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:46.933
Are you serious?

00:22:47.174 --> 00:22:50.371
Really? Come on.

00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:52.638
Are you serious?

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:56.280
I can't believe you are bringing him
into our school as a teacher.

00:22:56.516 --> 00:22:58.541
It will be interesting.

00:22:58.785 --> 00:23:02.118
You have an ulterior motive.

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:05.347
That class, you'll let him
take that class.

00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:07.890
Keep your mouth shut!

00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:10.923
I can't wait...

00:23:11.198 --> 00:23:15.157
...to see what
that Eikichi Onizuka will do.

00:23:15.402 --> 00:23:20.271
To see how he will change
the future of our students.

00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:26.803
I can't wait. I am looking forward
to the cherry blossom season.

00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:44.241
You and me, let's go away

00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:49.452
To look for new emotions today

00:23:49.687 --> 00:23:54.522
Together we can overcome

00:23:54.792 --> 00:24:00.458
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:00.731 --> 00:24:04.861
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:10.072
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:15.676
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.278
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:21.552 --> 00:24:31.086
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:41.036
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:41.272 --> 00:24:45.504
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:45.743 --> 00:24:50.612
So I just embrace my love

00:24:50.848 --> 00:24:55.683
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.291
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:18.131
PREVIEW

00:25:24.048 --> 00:25:25.879
Don't come any closer!

00:25:26.217 --> 00:25:27.707
I can't...

00:25:27.952 --> 00:25:30.318
...stand it anymore!

00:25:30.554 --> 00:25:34.422
I want to die!

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:42.898
I will make this school
a more interesting place.
