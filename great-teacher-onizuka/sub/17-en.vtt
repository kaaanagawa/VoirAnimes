WEBVTT

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.473
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.633
I don't just feel it

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:23.441
This street makes me love

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:27.210
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.350
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:37.722
Cars don't look they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.999
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:48.567
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:54.641
Lonely, lonely,
Even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.047 --> 00:01:00.417
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:05.783
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.951
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:18.831
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.404
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:26.205
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.819
Tom is two years old.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.148
Uncle Ben says,
"Tom you are very smart."

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.662
When this is translated
into English...

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:51.723
Tom is two years old.

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:56.094
Uncle Ben says,
"You are very clever, Tom!"

00:01:56.471 --> 00:02:01.170
Hey, why is Sakurada teaching
from such an easy section?

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:03.641
Maybe he is afraid that
a certain someone might point out...

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:06.545
... his mistakes if he gives us
difficult material.

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:07.604
Teacher!

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:13.185
Your translation
was a little wrong.

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:20.819
The word "clever" implies
"sneaky" and "sly."

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.429
Do you think it's appropriate to use
such a word for a two-year-old?

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.697
Here we go again!

00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:34.632
In this case, Americans would use
the word "smart." "You are smart!"

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.768
You would know at least that much
if you watched foreign movies and stuff.

00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:42.250
FACULTY ROOM

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:44.248
What about Americans?!

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.946
Don't make fun of me!

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.182
Sakurada-sensei. Calm down!

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:50.449
I...I wanted to go abroad...

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.857
...and learn English
in a native environment!

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.258
Whoa!

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.457
But it wasn't that common
when I was young.

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:00.530
If you have complaints, take them
to the Ministry of Education!

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:03.632
He was attacked
by Kanzaki's class terrorism.

00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:05.831
Poor thing!
He's even talking differently.

00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:08.000
He usually addresses
himself as "me."

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.270
Come on. How come
everyone is so flustered?

00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:13.108
She's just a kid.

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.512
Isn't that right,
Fuyutsuki-sensei?

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.444
Don't talk to me!

00:03:16.918 --> 00:03:20.081
Fifth period is my turn.

00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:21.813
Oh, is that so?

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.714
SCIENCE LAB 1

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.191
So, in summary...

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.261
...water is the combination
of hydrogen and oxygen.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.398
By performing electrolysis...

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.990
...it could be separated
into hydrogen and oxygen.

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.131
Kanzaki...

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.107
Kikuchi!

00:03:43.278 --> 00:03:47.442
I don't care why you carry out
classroom terrorism.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.879
Hey, are you allowed to switch
seats without permission?

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:55.348
But keep your
hands off of Onizuka!

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:57.823
He is nothing like
any of the teachers you know.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.827
Hmmm.
Are you on his side, Kikuchi?

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:05.157
Hard to believe, coming from someone
known as the master...

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.824
...of bullying a homeroom
teacher in Class 2-4.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.166
You successfully drove
three teachers out of school!

00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:14.566
Don't worry.

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:17.339
He's special for me, too.

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.937
So I'll treat him special...

00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:26.985
Then let's do an experiment.

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:28.712
Hey, Kikuchi.

00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:32.723
Doesn't your head feel clear
today...more than usual?

00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:33.816
What?

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:37.854
It feels like this room
is full of oxygen.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.999
So...when you put a match closer
to the gas extracted in this manner...

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.128
...you will find that this
is indeed hydrogen.

00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:51.903
Someone get a fire extinguisher!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.282
Ha ha ha...who in the world
would do such a bad thing?

00:04:59.788 --> 00:05:02.313
It's not funny. It's not funny!
It's worse than a joke!

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.190
Look. Look. Look at my hair.
Look at my hair!

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:09.557
I look like a chihuahua!
A chihuahua!

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:13.362
How can you laugh?

00:05:13.468 --> 00:05:17.529
It's definitely a trick played
by someone in YOUR class.

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:21.197
I saw oxygen tanks
with open valves.

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:23.073
It was intentional!

00:05:23.278 --> 00:05:24.643
Intentional!

00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:28.041
What...what...what are you
gonna do, Onizuka-sensei?!

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:32.917
I...I was supposed to go to
a Nelton Party. Nelton. Nelton!

00:05:32.988 --> 00:05:35.149
It was going to be my 29th one.

00:05:35.223 --> 00:05:38.386
Besides, this time I paid extra
for a ticket...

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.687
...to go to a Nelton Party with nurses.

00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:42.625
It was 25,000 yen.
25,000 yen!

00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:44.062
Hmm...

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.031
Back home my parents have
been bugging me to get married!

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:51.195
The party might have
been my only chance!

00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:53.467
Are you listening, Onizuka-sensei?

00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.438
Hey. Right there!
Don't laugh!

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.477
Hmm...

00:05:57.112 --> 00:05:59.774
All right, all right.
I heard you.

00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:00.982
What?

00:06:01.116 --> 00:06:04.017
We already know who did it.

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:10.186
I'll turn her into an obedient,
good girl with just one blow!

00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:15.062
Uh...

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.462
Where are you going,
Onizuka-kun?

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:20.792
Uh... I was going to give
an extra-curricular class...

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:22.200
In that outfit?

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.795
Well...extra-curricular
in the subject of life.

00:06:24.873 --> 00:06:27.967
There is this kid whose tricks
are a little over the edge...

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:31.043
It can't be Urumi Kanzaki,
can it?

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:33.547
Huh? Well...sort of...

00:06:33.615 --> 00:06:35.344
Do you have proof?

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:36.745
Proof?

00:06:37.252 --> 00:06:38.378
What?

00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:41.986
Have you forgotten
what I told you the other day?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.748
She is a specially treated student
certified by the Ministry of Education.

00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:48.057
She is a genius
with an IQ of 200!

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.032
If anything should happen to her,
firing you wouldn't be enough!

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:56.328
Do the other teachers
understand, too?

00:06:56.538 --> 00:06:58.028
With Urumi Kanzaki...

00:06:58.173 --> 00:07:02.200
...we expect all of you to handle her
carefully as if caring for a bruise!

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.540
Kanzaki has been like that...

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:10.311
...since before bullying of a homeroom
teacher began in our class.

00:07:10.518 --> 00:07:13.510
Yeah. She's been making a career
out of it more than we do.

00:07:13.988 --> 00:07:16.422
Besides the fact that she is
a specially treated student...

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:20.827
... Kanzaki is kind of hard
to approach, even for us.

00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:25.030
That's right. She is kind of scary
to get involved with.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.901
When she stopped coming to school
I felt relieved, to be honest...

00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:30.968
Hmmm.

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:38.039
I heard from Aizawa a long time ago
that she had a traumatic experience.

00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:39.980
Tora-uma? (tiger-horse)

00:07:42.317 --> 00:07:44.512
Is there such an animal?

00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:51.288
Is this guy imagining
something outrageous?

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:52.359
He might be...

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.061
So... Tora-uma...

00:08:26.928 --> 00:08:28.054
Oops?

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:31.858
Huh? Where did she go?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.058
Teacher!

00:08:33.134 --> 00:08:34.101
Hmm!

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.168
What are you doing?

00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:37.304
Uh...

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.406
Did you need me?

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:44.743
Hmm...I heard from Kikuchi
and his buddies.

00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:45.779
What?

00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:50.384
You...are holding in a huge
Tora-uma, aren't you?

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:55.581
If that's the case, you should
have told me much earlier.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.818
I'm really good
at exterminating violent beasts!

00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:02.789
Teacher...
do you know what trauma is?

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:05.024
Sure! Something like this, right?

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:06.259
EIKICHI THEATRE
FOR GOOD CHILDREN

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:07.959
A rare and violent beast, Tora-uma!

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.434
BEAST OF TRAUMA (TORA-UMA)
TEMPER: VIOLENT

00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:10.872
Urumi is in a pinch!
Oh, no!

00:09:10.872 --> 00:09:12.464
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTIC:
EATS FEMALE STUDENTS

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:13.935
Are you serious?

00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:15.435
Of course!

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:19.878
Ah...ha ha ha.
Teacher, you're the best!

00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.414
Ah...ha ha ha...

00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:22.449
Hmm?

00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:24.676
RAMEN

00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:26.720
Oh, now I understand.

00:09:30.058 --> 00:09:31.582
Tasty.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.088
Disgusting!

00:09:34.162 --> 00:09:35.356
Hah!

00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:38.566
Since the explanations by Kikuchi
and his buddies were a little strange...

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:42.467
...I came to the conclusion that
a violent beast is living in your house...

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:47.207
But...it would be a big problem
if such a beast settled in my house.

00:09:47.475 --> 00:09:48.499
Wouldn't it?

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:50.970
You are...a nice person.

00:09:51.412 --> 00:09:54.904
Well, I'm just doing my job
as a teacher...

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.850
But I happen to know...

00:09:58.453 --> 00:10:01.445
...that teachers in general don't hesitate
to abandon their students...

00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:02.955
...in a time of crisis.

00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:05.519
Huh? Hey, dummy!

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.389
Why would I do that?

00:10:08.296 --> 00:10:09.991
Oh, really?

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:11.031
What?

00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:12.723
Then I'll test it.

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:14.802
One...

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.860
...two...three!

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:22.709
Ah! Dummy!

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.607
It hit someone!

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:25.646
Bingo!

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.910
Umm...we're sorry. Are you O.K.?

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.417
Oops!

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:34.782
Punch Perm...
A gold button...

00:10:34.922 --> 00:10:37.186
Could...could he be...?

00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:38.791
Young boss.

00:10:38.893 --> 00:10:39.860
What?

00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:43.090
Who the hell are you?
Did you do this to our boss?

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:44.597
Uh. No...Umm...

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:50.204
Yes! I did! I was going
to clean up trash in the city!

00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:52.068
Hey, you stupid!
What are you saying!

00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:55.474
What are you gonna do?
Abandon me?

00:10:55.543 --> 00:10:57.374
Did you call us trash?
You brat!

00:10:57.645 --> 00:10:59.272
I can't believe it!

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.573
Now, are you scared, young lady?

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:06.943
You brat!

00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.553
Stupid!
Don't just stand there!

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:14.256
Those bastards!
Wait!

00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:29.340
- Whoa!
- Help!

00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:37.508
- Did you see them?
- Shit! Where did they go?

00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:43.046
Phew.
We managed to get away.

00:11:43.823 --> 00:11:44.881
It was fun.

00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:46.283
In what sense?

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.194
If we'd made even a minor mistake,
we would be...

00:11:49.262 --> 00:11:52.163
...at the bottom of Tokyo Bay
encased in concrete by now!

00:11:52.398 --> 00:11:54.662
Since we didn't make
a mistake, I don't care.

00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:58.399
Unbelievable!
I can't hang out with you.

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:01.504
Where are you going?

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:02.666
Going home.

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:06.939
Those guys might be
hanging out in this area.

00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:10.312
If they find me, I might get killed...

00:12:10.483 --> 00:12:11.643
Why should I care?

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.420
Oh... I see...

00:12:16.822 --> 00:12:19.256
Gosh...my life expectancy
has been shortened.

00:12:20.092 --> 00:12:21.582
Teacher...

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:26.131
I'll kill myself!

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.097
What?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.192
I'm gonna write a suicide note.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.669
Hey. What are you doing, Kanzaki?

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:38.074
A suicide note: I'm killing myself
because Onizuka-sensei hates me now.

00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:39.236
Crap!

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:43.742
Whoa!
Don't kill yourself! If you do, I'll kill you!

00:12:43.816 --> 00:12:45.807
Farewell to everyone on the planet.

00:12:46.252 --> 00:12:49.449
- Do you understand? Stay put!
- Hello, everyone in heaven.

00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:51.887
I'm joining you today as a new...

00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:56.862
Did I scare you?

00:12:56.929 --> 00:12:58.760
Of course you did!

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:02.324
All right, all right.

00:13:02.568 --> 00:13:04.160
I won't abandon you.

00:13:04.237 --> 00:13:07.206
So don't ever play
this kind of joke on me again.

00:13:07.873 --> 00:13:09.864
It's not a joke.

00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:13.812
I was...half serious.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:14.846
What?

00:13:15.014 --> 00:13:18.006
Every now and then there are nights...

00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:21.345
...when I feel so lonely...
and depressed.

00:13:21.487 --> 00:13:25.719
I wonder why someone
like me was born into this world.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:30.058
I even wish I could vanish
from this world...

00:13:30.196 --> 00:13:35.099
...and pretend that I never existed...

00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:38.596
Stand up, Kanzaki.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:45.439
When I get negative thoughts like that,
it usually means I'm hungry.

00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:46.737
Seriously?

00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:50.241
Yeah. Also, we were
in the middle of eating ramen.

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:53.278
Then I want to eat yakiniku!

00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:54.444
What?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.183
If I can't have it,
maybe I'll jump from here...

00:13:58.491 --> 00:13:59.788
Whoa...

00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:03.553
Wow...stop it!
Wait! Wait a second!

00:14:05.798 --> 00:14:08.289
Crap! Too many days till payday.

00:14:08.434 --> 00:14:11.198
Ah! Teacher,
there's some money at your feet!

00:14:11.437 --> 00:14:12.768
What?

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:14.769
Oh, lucky!

00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:24.238
What?

00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:29.579
Kanzaki!

00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:31.313
Whoa!

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.923
Whoa!

00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:44.097
Ouch. Hey, Kanzaki!
Are you all right?

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:47.529
Whoa!

00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:50.842
Oh, this is a mannequin!

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:56.139
Kanzaki! Oh, crap!

00:14:57.717 --> 00:15:00.208
Kanzaki! Wake up!

00:15:02.988 --> 00:15:04.785
She's dead!

00:15:07.693 --> 00:15:10.594
MURDER BY BUTT BLOW!

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:16.526
Chief Detective, what's the weapon?

00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:18.830
Hmm...probably one big butt blow.

00:15:19.138 --> 00:15:21.265
The entire mystery is solved!

00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:24.807
In the name of my grandpa...

00:15:28.814 --> 00:15:31.578
Please stop committing more crimes!

00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:35.685
"When we look back...
it is so admirable...

00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:39.384
...all the hard work
by our respectable teachers..."

00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:45.397
I happen to know that
teachers usually don't hesitate...

00:15:45.498 --> 00:15:47.295
...to abandon their students
in a time of crisis.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.767
COMING SOON TO THIS THEATRE

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:54.135
Whoa! I don't have time
to turn this whole thing into a movie!

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:57.098
Calm down!
Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old!

00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:00.110
It's not that she's positively dead!

00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:05.110
If I rush her to a hospital...

00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:06.218
Hey.

00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:07.912
Hmm?
Hey, what are you doing?

00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:11.513
Ah! Wait!

00:16:13.893 --> 00:16:15.258
Wait!

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.030
I look like a murder suspect
running away...

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:22.863
...from the scene of the crime
after being noticed!

00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:25.762
Well, actually, it's pretty close to that...

00:16:26.105 --> 00:16:28.130
Crap, it's not even funny.

00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:29.504
Wait!

00:16:33.012 --> 00:16:36.448
Ah... I've got to do something
with this girl... this girl...

00:16:36.515 --> 00:16:38.039
... this corpse...

00:16:38.117 --> 00:16:39.175
Bury it!

00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:40.218
What?

00:16:40.953 --> 00:16:43.012
Bury it?
You mean this corpse?

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.188
That's right.
Somewhere that's not conspicuous.

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:49.090
What about a deep forest
near Mt. Fuji?

00:16:49.395 --> 00:16:54.128
- The body won't be easily found there.
- At the foot of Mt. Fuji.

00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:59.070
A deep forest near Mt. Fuji.

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:14.812
What...
What am I doing?

00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:18.379
I look just like a murderer
on the Saturday Night Movie.

00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:22.291
Wake up! Wake up,
Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old!

00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:24.225
You're a teacher!

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:26.730
Do you think it's right for a teacher
to bury a student?

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:30.324
That's right. Help her!
It may not be too late!

00:17:30.402 --> 00:17:32.768
But I've already brought her
to a forest. Hey...

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:35.733
Ah! I know! CPR!

00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:41.379
Why didn't I think of it before?

00:17:45.451 --> 00:17:47.851
All right. I'm ready.

00:17:50.723 --> 00:17:55.717
Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old.
A bachelor. Allow me to get going.

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.266
Wah!

00:18:05.571 --> 00:18:08.563
I'll get you!

00:18:08.807 --> 00:18:12.436
Ah! I'm sorry.
Please cross over peacefully!

00:18:13.145 --> 00:18:17.809
Hey, could you stop treating me
like a dead person?

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.649
What?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.421
Phew. No matter how it happened,
I'm glad you are alive.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.559
It's got to be the power of Mt. Fuji...
a spiritual, sacred mountain...

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.890
Attempted murder
and abandonment of the corpse.

00:18:31.363 --> 00:18:35.823
Here, Kanzaki! Go ahead
and order whatever you want to eat!

00:18:36.068 --> 00:18:39.504
I want...a genie in a lamp.

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:42.774
A genie?
Is there such a thing?

00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:44.172
Don't you know?

00:18:44.243 --> 00:18:46.643
You rub a lamp like this and say
something like, "Rah-ri-pap-pah."

00:18:46.712 --> 00:18:50.170
Then it appears and says,
"Aye-aye, Master."

00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:51.614
It's a fairy tale...

00:18:51.684 --> 00:18:55.711
...a malevolent deity who makes
whatever you wish for come true.

00:18:55.854 --> 00:18:57.879
You're not saying...
you want me to be...

00:18:58.123 --> 00:18:59.920
Yes, thank you.
All right?

00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:02.960
You must be joking!
Why should I...

00:19:03.028 --> 00:19:04.791
About 10 years in prison...

00:19:04.863 --> 00:19:08.264
...for attempted murder
and abandonment of a corpse...

00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:11.292
Like "Rah-ri-pap-pah!"
Genie!

00:19:11.403 --> 00:19:14.497
Come out
if you don't want to go to prison!

00:19:14.807 --> 00:19:17.935
Pah-pa-ra-pah!
Aye-aye, Master!

00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:20.676
Cool! So much fun!

00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:25.650
Hooray! Go, go. Speed away!

00:19:27.653 --> 00:19:30.622
Crap!
The motorcycle gangs from the area!

00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:33.089
Rah-ri-pap-pah! Genie!

00:19:33.158 --> 00:19:35.422
Go past them and speed away!

00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:36.562
What?

00:19:36.562 --> 00:19:38.928
Do you want to eat prison food?

00:19:39.632 --> 00:19:44.035
Ummm... Pah-pa-ra-pah!
As you wish, Master!

00:19:45.104 --> 00:19:47.095
Hold on tight!

00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:50.006
Move over, move over!

00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.976
Here comes a genie!

00:19:55.247 --> 00:19:59.047
Hey! Don't make light of Kofu Racing!

00:19:59.918 --> 00:20:01.909
Let's run away!

00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:04.387
Wait! We're gonna get you guys!

00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:07.515
Teacher!

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.059
I've never had such a fun night.

00:20:11.296 --> 00:20:13.423
Oh, really?

00:20:13.565 --> 00:20:17.331
Really. I swear.
First time in my life!

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:20.371
I'm gonna pee in my pants!

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:21.838
Don't!

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:25.900
Stop somewhere around here.

00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:31.882
Ah. Now I want to eat sweets
from Nagoya.

00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:35.849
That's right.
True sweets from Nagoya!

00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:36.921
Come on!

00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:38.286
10 years in prison!

00:20:38.457 --> 00:20:41.017
By tomorrow, please. O. K.?

00:20:41.093 --> 00:20:42.993
Aye-aye, Master.

00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:47.688
Kanzaki!

00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:52.197
Ah, I didn't know
Kikuchi's house was nearby.

00:20:52.304 --> 00:20:55.137
What did you do to Onizuka?

00:20:56.408 --> 00:20:57.568
Don-ketsu?

00:20:58.177 --> 00:21:01.840
Yeah.
What do you think he did, then?

00:21:02.047 --> 00:21:04.845
He jumped off to rescue you.

00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:11.087
Yup! Hmm...You know.

00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:13.886
He's that kind of a guy...Onizuka...

00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:17.122
That kind of a guy...

00:21:18.764 --> 00:21:21.324
What a brave guy to come back!

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.231
We're gonna kill you this time!

00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:25.532
Don't make light of Kofu Racing!

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:30.397
Uiro!

00:21:47.144 --> 00:21:51.877
You can't love everyone

00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:55.109
It's only for the one you love

00:21:55.385 --> 00:21:59.287
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:04.689
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:05.662 --> 00:22:09.257
Just stay innocent

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:13.469
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:13.737 --> 00:22:21.610
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:21.878 --> 00:22:26.406
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:28.151 --> 00:22:31.678
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:31.922 --> 00:22:35.915
What is there for me to do?

00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:39.959
It may be small now

00:22:40.163 --> 00:22:44.122
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:44.367 --> 00:22:47.962
A tear is about to drop

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:52.241
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:52.509 --> 00:22:56.104
Live strong every moment

00:22:56.313 --> 00:23:02.411
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.595
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:17.734 --> 00:23:18.996
Fujimori.

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:22.033
What? Is this teacher married?

00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:23.834
She's still not married.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.168
Because it's not tasty...

00:23:27.577 --> 00:23:29.408
... right, Miss Fujimori?
