WEBVTT

00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:21.641
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.313
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.079
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:38.523
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.357
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:49.263
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.667
Let's cut loose until
We reach our limit

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:59.704
So we can reach the horizon

00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:04.174
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:07.820
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.150
Toward the finish line

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.537
What's wrong, everyone?
The next class is starting.

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:49.078
-Look at this!
-Look, teacher!

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:13.871
I didn't sleep enough.
I had a lot going on yesterday.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.673
Jeez, I'm in trouble.
It's time for a homeroom meeting.

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:21.380
Well, I have to start out
with a smoke.

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:34.383
Hey. Morning!

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:37.788
You weird teacher!

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:41.627
Wait. What?
What are you looking at?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.602
Ah, Fuyutsuki-chan.
No, Fuyutsuki-sensei!

00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:51.609
What's wrong?
Your body is trembling.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.071
Did you get food poisoning
or something?

00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:59.548
What--? What the heck is this?

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:02.415
Why am I the victim of "Mokuba Zeme"?

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.716
What the hell is going on?
What's going on?

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:10.761
You are a pig, Onizuka-kun!

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:13.967
I never imagined you had such a hobby!

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.501
-I trusted you!
-No, it's a misunderstanding!

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.798
It's not me. I've never even
seen a wooden horse like this!

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:25.277
Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.077
Listen, you guys!

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:35.618
Look at this carefully!
In this photo, right here.

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:37.881
Here! You see this scar?

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.322
I don't have that on my rear,
I swear!

00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:47.232
Okay, I'll show you proof. Here!

00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:53.906
It's not there, right?
Hey! Look. See, right?

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:03.812
Are you convinced?

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:06.679
It has just begun.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.151
The bullying of the homeroom teacher
by Class 3-4.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.357
FACULTY ROOM

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:15.961
I swear I've never been
on a wooden horse.

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:20.194
A wooden horse. I swear.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:24.029
I've been to a cabaret club
but that's it.

00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:26.398
Did something happen?

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:28.864
Amazing!

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.871
That is a pretty wild hobby.

00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:36.344
I'm telling you.
I haven't been on it!

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.212
Though it may not be believable,
I promised myself...

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:42.354
...I'd never be involved
with strange sex.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:48.027
Don't worry about it.
Everyone has his own unique hobbies.

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.921
I'm telling you, that's not it.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.030
Could it be...?

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:57.670
Could it be that you are doing this
without your own knowledge?

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.874
What? Could that be possible?

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:04.441
Well, this is a very stressful job.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.643
Oh, Onizuka-sensei, this is....

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:14.282
Subconsciously.

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.457
Could it be possible?

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.326
Onizuka-sensei!

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.921
Oh, vice principal....

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:31.035
What am I gonna do? If I'm doing
those things without knowing....

00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:34.636
Onizuka-sensei, I'll explain it to you.

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.439
Give me back my Cresta, you bastard!

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:44.742
Vice principal!

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:49.513
I may not be able
to have a normal marriage.

00:05:49.756 --> 00:05:52.850
Give me back my Cresta!
Give me back--

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:56.321
Where am I? Who am I?

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.655
Just calm down!

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.959
Let go! I'd rather kill him
and kill myself!

00:06:02.202 --> 00:06:06.229
Let go. Please! Let go of me!

00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:11.340
Absolutely pathetic.
He completely freaked out!

00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:15.139
We scored! It was a huge success.

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:19.079
Kikuchi is a genius.
He's on a professional level.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:23.348
Seriously, you could probably
make a living out of it.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.923
You idiot, life is not that easy.

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:32.330
If we keep it up, he won't last
a month. He is such a joker.

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.660
Let's force him into getting fired
quickly. Like Kahara.

00:06:36.903 --> 00:06:38.461
That's right.

00:06:38.705 --> 00:06:43.005
We'll let the school know that
we don't need a damn teacher.

00:06:43.977 --> 00:06:47.845
All stupid teachers should
kill themselves!

00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:53.513
Hey, he's coming!

00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:10.868
This is..!

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.274
Onizuka.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:25.207
Let's discuss the various problems
of modern education.

00:07:25.452 --> 00:07:30.253
We should start with a naked
relationship. That's our priority!

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:37.086
-What is it?
-Did he lose it?

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:42.598
No, no, no! I can't stand it!

00:07:42.836 --> 00:07:47.500
No, no, it can't be!
There is absolutely no way!

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.243
-He is so dumb! Is he serious?
-He's gung-ho about the wrong thing!

00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.657
It is absolutely impossible!

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:11.295
S &amp; M is better than doing it
with the vice principal.

00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:16.298
Wait. Wait a minute! Calm down.
Settle down, Eikichi Onizuka.

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:18.936
First.... First....

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:23.834
Yes! First, I need to convince
Fuyutsuki-chan of the truth!

00:08:24.077 --> 00:08:26.545
I need to make her realize
I'm innocent.

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.811
-Milk, please.
-Here.

00:08:31.985 --> 00:08:35.352
What's wrong?
You are not happy, Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:40.151
Principal, I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.

00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:43.095
It must be that photo of Onizuka-sensei.

00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.262
You slapped him,
and you are concerned about him.

00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:50.367
Were you watching?

00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:55.564
Well, he deserved to be slapped!
What a shameless pig!

00:08:55.976 --> 00:09:00.037
Well, he might be the kind
of person to do such a thing.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.273
But I'm not convinced.
The story is a little too perfect.

00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:08.617
I wonder if this incident is
as simple as it looks.

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:14.089
This.... This is....

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:18.023
I picked it up from the trash
when I had a class there.

00:09:18.698 --> 00:09:22.327
It would not be good
if it was leaked outside the school.

00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:28.873
Come on, vice principal.
This is one of their standard tricks.

00:09:29.109 --> 00:09:30.872
Could you leave me alone?

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:35.948
Please. Leave me alone.

00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:39.750
What a....

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:43.149
What an embarrassing thing!

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.290
UCHIYAMADA

00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:46.787
Then what?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.091
Then....

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:51.623
Good morning.

00:09:52.265 --> 00:09:57.202
I wish you'd get up earlier. I can't
finish cleaning up the kitchen.

00:09:57.437 --> 00:10:00.634
-Is that so?
-What?

00:10:00.874 --> 00:10:05.368
So, can I please go to Karuizawa...

00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:08.672
...with Ryoko and my other friends?

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:10.780
It's just overnight.

00:10:11.017 --> 00:10:13.212
I wonder when it started.

00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:18.823
It's been 15 years since we took
a loan to build this house in Iruma.

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:24.520
For some time, my wife has been cold
and my daughter avoids me.

00:10:24.764 --> 00:10:28.757
I just bring my paycheck home.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.568
But I haven't lost hope yet.

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:35.297
I just need Cresta, my dear Cresta.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:39.342
So white and shiny like
in the TV commercial.

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:41.672
She was supposed to provide me...

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:45.544
... with a loving wife
and daughter, like before.

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:50.188
But she was totaled
after only one day!

00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:53.358
And no one even tried
to find out the truth!

00:10:53.593 --> 00:10:58.826
Furthermore, an embarrassing photo
was posted on a wall!

00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:03.092
Never has my life been so screwed up!

00:11:03.436 --> 00:11:08.100
I know, it's him! Rotten things
started happening since he came.

00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:12.209
He is a devil. I need to
remove him as soon as possible.

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:16.944
I need to expel him from our school.

00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.046
Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard!

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:26.050
You'll see, you'll see!
You'll see...

00:11:26.293 --> 00:11:29.456
...Onizuka!

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.551
But I'm not convinced.
The story is a little too perfect.

00:11:38.794 --> 00:11:40.352
Excuse me.

00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:46.329
I want you to listen to me.
Even if it's for a short while.

00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:48.330
Onizuka-sensei?

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.061
It's a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding!

00:11:51.307 --> 00:11:53.707
Look at me, pure and innocent me.

00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:58.880
An angel like me would never
participate in a perverted sex act.

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:01.674
You are trying
to convince me of that?

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:04.249
Oops. Doesn't this work?

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:07.751
I have costumes from
the boys and girls' chorus play.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.720
That's enough. I understand.

00:12:11.327 --> 00:12:13.693
Then, do you believe me?

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.191
I don't have any right
to make an issue...

00:12:18.434 --> 00:12:20.664
...of your private hobbies.

00:12:20.903 --> 00:12:25.465
No, that's not the point,
Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:27.636
Why is that?

00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:30.406
Well, because....

00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:36.608
How am I supposed to believe you
after seeing such a photo?

00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:39.054
Pardon me.

00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:41.913
Oh, no. Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:51.061
That guy is so dumb!

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.927
This is it.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.965
The next plan.

00:12:58.007 --> 00:13:00.532
COMPUTER ROOM

00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:04.539
Hey, do it quickly.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.180
Don't rush it.

00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:13.045
You'll see, you bastard Onizuka.

00:13:13.622 --> 00:13:15.522
Wow! Awesome!

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:17.988
Amazing! It looks so real!

00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:40.972
Where is he?

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:47.384
In order to fire him, we need proof
that he is unfit to be a teacher.

00:13:47.623 --> 00:13:49.420
Bastard Onizuka, you'll see.

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:53.492
I will expose
every single secret of yours!

00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:08.735
Here we go.

00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:12.445
Have to wash well.

00:14:13.782 --> 00:14:16.649
He is bathing in a sink
used to wash hands...

00:14:17.086 --> 00:14:19.350
...using the school's lemon soap...

00:14:19.688 --> 00:14:23.089
...and rubbing it directly
on his crotch.

00:14:24.693 --> 00:14:28.595
Isn't there any way to convince
Fuyutsuki-chan it's a misunderstanding?

00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:32.323
It's really frustrating.

00:14:36.738 --> 00:14:40.936
Bathing in cold water is
a little too chilly. I'm done.

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:46.513
My clothes, my clothes!

00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:53.849
Why do I need to hide?
How annoying!

00:15:02.564 --> 00:15:07.467
That bastard Onizuka!
I will never give up.

00:15:14.576 --> 00:15:16.237
What is it this time?

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:19.174
Hey, you guys, wait! Don't look!

00:15:19.515 --> 00:15:22.416
Wait! Don't look until I look!

00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:28.490
Fuyutsuki-chan!

00:15:34.363 --> 00:15:37.025
What the hell...?

00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:41.861
I'm leaving a love hotel.

00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:48.034
Who the hell is this woman?
Does anyone know?

00:15:48.277 --> 00:15:50.802
Hey, Fuyutsuki-chan, do you know...?

00:15:55.984 --> 00:15:59.886
Are you making fun of me?
That's mean.

00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:08.689
He's nailed.
He is really depressed.

00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:13.834
This happened to him because
he was flirting with the new teacher!

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:15.502
He deserved it.

00:16:15.737 --> 00:16:19.673
We don't need to do anything more.
He'll crumble. Right, Kikuchi?

00:16:20.275 --> 00:16:25.008
No. We wanna make extra sure
with one more push.

00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:28.281
You are so evil as usual.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.090
I don't know what to do.

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:46.034
Shit!

00:16:46.935 --> 00:16:49.165
I need to get closer.

00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:53.932
In order to expose his true nature,
I need to get closer.

00:16:56.044 --> 00:16:59.480
Yeah, it is really well done.

00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:02.775
Fuyutsuki-sensei, did you see this?

00:17:03.285 --> 00:17:04.252
What?

00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:08.717
We were just looking
at this product of mischief.

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:12.222
Sorry, but I don't want
to look at indecent pictures.

00:17:12.995 --> 00:17:14.792
That's not what it is.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:20.161
We were talking about how good it is.
It's hard to tell it's a composite.

00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:23.730
A composite?

00:17:23.972 --> 00:17:25.405
Didn't you know?

00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:30.073
The students from Class 2-4
use the trick often.

00:17:30.312 --> 00:17:34.646
If you look closely, the head and
the body have a different resolution.

00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:37.413
That's unbelievable.

00:17:39.054 --> 00:17:43.991
I see. She wasn't here
when Kahara-sensei was here.

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:54.033
That devil!

00:17:54.603 --> 00:17:59.905
Damn it! I wonder if
I have a split personality.

00:18:00.142 --> 00:18:05.045
I might be doing those things
without knowing it.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.943
I wonder if my spirit leaves
my body without me knowing!

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.288
Even transparent, that part
of your body is very impressive.

00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:20.790
Of course.

00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:26.057
Let's spend an infinitely
transparent time together, baby!

00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:29.565
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:33.667
I shouldn't be entertaining
stupid ideas.

00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:37.208
Teacher, your spirit is
not leaving your body.

00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:41.642
Yoshikawa.

00:18:52.094 --> 00:18:56.963
You don't have a split personality and
your spirit isn't leaving your body.

00:18:57.199 --> 00:19:00.259
They're composite photos
created on a computer.

00:19:00.502 --> 00:19:02.993
What?! Is that true?

00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:07.572
Yeah. You see them in magazines.

00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:09.776
Composite?

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:16.608
Teacher, I know who did it.

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:20.816
The person who made those photos
is in our class.

00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:24.221
Hey, Yoshikawa.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.629
Onizuka-sensei!

00:19:38.473 --> 00:19:42.239
Yoshikawa, don't say anything else.

00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:45.211
Someone in your class?

00:19:45.947 --> 00:19:48.643
Someone who tells on a classmate...

00:19:49.117 --> 00:19:51.585
...I don't wanna trust.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.781
Teacher....

00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:59.456
I will make them pay for this.

00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:01.622
Okay.

00:20:07.469 --> 00:20:09.232
Fuyutsuki-chan.

00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:13.799
Onizuka-sensei, I'm sorry.

00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:18.569
I didn't believe you...

00:20:18.814 --> 00:20:22.147
...and I even slapped you.
I am so sorry.

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:28.817
It's okay.
As long as you understand.

00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:33.818
Really? Oh, I'm relieved!
But I want to make up for it.

00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:36.690
I know!
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:41.559
-Really?
-Yes. Just leave it to me.

00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:45.103
What are you laughing about?

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.709
I have some business to take
care of. I'll be right back.

00:20:53.748 --> 00:20:58.617
I will make sure they will pay dearly
for making my spirit leave my body.

00:20:59.754 --> 00:21:01.847
Onizuka-sensei.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.682
COMPUTER ROOM

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:07.554
This is the final blow.
This will make him leave.

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:11.260
Kikuchi's skill is getting better.
Awesome!

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.268
Shut up. You are distracting me.

00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:19.040
When we put this on the intranet,
that will be it for him!

00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:21.834
Excuse me. Let me see.

00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:28.709
-Onizuka.
-Where did you sneak in from?

00:21:29.017 --> 00:21:30.746
Just like a roach.

00:21:34.022 --> 00:21:35.649
Hey, Kikuchi.

00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:40.561
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need your face.

00:21:41.062 --> 00:21:43.360
Hey, what are you gonna do?

00:21:43.598 --> 00:21:45.498
I'm gonna make him pay.

00:21:45.734 --> 00:21:50.068
You guys, if you follow us,
I'll kill you.

00:21:56.077 --> 00:21:58.705
What are you gonna do?
Kick me out?

00:21:58.947 --> 00:22:00.812
If you use violence...

00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:04.546
...you will be kicked out
of the school.

00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:15.759
Hey, Kikuchi, do me a favor.

00:22:18.366 --> 00:22:19.458
This.

00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:21.263
What?

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.367
Could you use this photo
and my magazines...

00:22:25.607 --> 00:22:30.067
...to make a composite photo?

00:22:33.582 --> 00:22:36.551
Someone help me.

00:22:36.952 --> 00:22:38.681
I'm so relieved.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.549
Onizuka-sensei is not
that kind of person after all.

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:47.455
For this photo use this head
and superimpose it on that pose.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.761
Okay? Okay? Okay?

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:56.130
You are so talented that I won't ask
for it for free. How about 1000 yen?

00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:59.736
No? What about 2000 yen?

00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:03.001
Okay. 3000 yen, a sacrificial price...

00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:05.906
...and I will give you
an X-rated, unedited video!

00:23:08.917 --> 00:23:12.580
Kikuchi-kun, don't disappoint me.

00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:16.313
I'll give you three days.
If that's too tight, one week.

00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:18.219
See you!

00:23:23.264 --> 00:23:26.495
He is something, that bastard!

00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:46.055
You and me, let's go away

00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:51.266
To look for new emotions today

00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:56.336
Together we can overcome

00:23:56.606 --> 00:24:02.272
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:06.675
Open your eyes and open the door

00:24:07.483 --> 00:24:11.886
The world in front of your eyes

00:24:12.688 --> 00:24:17.489
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:22.092
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:24:23.366 --> 00:24:32.900
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:42.850
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:47.317
I want to see you, but I can't

00:24:47.557 --> 00:24:52.426
So I just embrace my love

00:24:52.662 --> 00:24:57.497
Even walking on a crowded street

00:24:57.733 --> 00:25:04.104
Your smile makes my head spin

00:25:14.984 --> 00:25:15.678
PREVIEW

00:25:15.918 --> 00:25:18.079
Why are you enjoying Onizuka's class?

00:25:18.688 --> 00:25:22.590
I'm leaving your group, but I don't
accept Onizuka as my teacher.

00:25:23.593 --> 00:25:24.617
How small!

00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:29.627
If you continue to get along with
Onizuka, I'll expose these photos.

00:25:33.936 --> 00:25:35.130
Here is the microphone.

00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:39.603
Who are you? You're harassing us.
You won't get away with this!

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:43.076
You did the wrong thing.

00:25:43.312 --> 00:25:45.507
You broke my policy.
