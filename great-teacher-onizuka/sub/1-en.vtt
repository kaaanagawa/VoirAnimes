00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:04.170
-Did you buy a new album?
-No, I didn't.

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:07.421
White, nice.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.122
Well, it's about time.

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.393
I'm kind of nervous.

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:17.997
Hey, pal!

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:21.861
You. You!

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.538
You, blondie.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.509
You were looking up at that high
school girl's panties, weren't you?

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:32.545
You should know better at your age.
It's a crime.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.716
You peeping pervert!

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.922
Give us your wallet...

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:45.650
...or we'll call the police
after beating you up.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.429
Now, here is the question:

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.794
Who is going to get killed?

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.028
Me, a pervert with
a second-degree black belt...

00:00:57.273 --> 00:01:00.902
...or the pathetic pair
who are, unfortunately...

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.578
...trying to swindle money out of me?

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:07.538
Now, which is it?

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.754
Hey, Eikichi, where are you?

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.557
Oh, Ryuji. Thanks for picking me up!

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:19.387
Shit. I didn't realize
it was this late.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.961
Sorry, guys. Thanks for the money.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.432
Next time you try to extort money,
be careful.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.467
-Let's go, Ryuji.
-Wait!

00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:33.334
It's not even funny to be late
from day one. I'm gonna speed up.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:45.247
Only today. Why do I need
to give you a ride?

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:48.321
Come on.
We are best buddies, aren't we?

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:53.688
It's been six years
since we came out to Tokyo.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.799
Now you are in charge of a store.
What a change!

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.732
Look who's talking.
I can't believe what you're doing.

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:03.870
About what?

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:08.065
Stupid! Student teaching, what else?

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.246
You, of all people,
trying to be a teacher!

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.644
Student teaching!
It gets me excited!

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:20.583
A bunch of innocent high school girls.
I can't wait!

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:24.091
Onizuka-sensei,
please explain this to me.

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:25.954
Where is it?

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:27.753
Right here.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.261
What? Where?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.560
Right here. Here.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.330
Such good stuff could happen.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:41.538
It's just out of this world!
Seriously!

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.715
Okay, I see.
Wow, that is amazing.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.444
Right, isn't it amazing?
So, please let me go today.

00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:58.024
I'll be a public servant like you.
I'll introduce a girl to you.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.660
Now, you sign here.

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.524
That's why....

00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:27.246
My adrenaline's always flowin'

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:32.918
So it feels like I'll overheat

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:37.684
Even if I explode and turn to ashes

00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:44.129
I'll probably still be laughing
Just like this

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:49.962
Blowing past the town
To the ends of the world

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:54.868
Let's burn rubber
And die together like lovers

00:03:55.676 --> 00:04:00.272
Let's cut loose
Until we reach our limit

00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:05.309
So we can reach the horizon

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.779
Crash! Into the rolling morning

00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:13.425
Flash!
I'm in the coolest driver's high

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:18.755
Toward the best finish

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.571
Musashi-No-Kita High School

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:47.352
-See you.
-Yeah.

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:03.938
There are boys too,
but he only sees the girls.

00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:08.667
Gosh, lively gals with super
miniskirts everywhere. Good!

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:13.910
-Teacher!
-Calm down, calm down.

00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:21.045
Excuse me.

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.816
Underwear!

00:05:26.663 --> 00:05:29.154
Aren't you a teacher?

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:37.070
Yes. Teacher. Right, I'm a teacher.

00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:42.066
So, what do you need
from the teacher?

00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.940
Could you give me the ball
at your feet?

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:50.877
What--? Oh, I didn't notice.
Silly me!

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:57.016
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much, teacher!

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.490
This is like a dream.

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:06.458
You already have your eye on someone?

00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:08.303
Who is it?

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:11.530
Don't use such a threatening voice.

00:06:13.076 --> 00:06:17.877
I am Hidero Osawa. I am a student
teacher like you. How is it going?

00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:21.483
Really? You too?

00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:26.687
Third time? You're repeating
student teaching so many times!

00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:29.915
-Well, there are various reasons.
-Various?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.120
These, these.

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:37.060
13 girls the year before last.
20 last year, I gobbled.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.667
Gobbled....
You mean the female students.

00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:45.567
Hey, of course it was mutual.

00:06:46.743 --> 00:06:49.268
Teach me. How did you...?

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:52.037
Well, there are all kinds of--

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:57.546
We're going to be late.
Well, let's keep up.

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:04.116
In this career it is possible to
marry a 16-year-old girl in your 40s.

00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:09.161
In my 40s...16-year-old....

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.394
I will teach you the techniques later.

00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.001
Master!

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:25.010
Student teaching is part
of the college curriculum.

00:07:25.248 --> 00:07:29.150
But our students won't view it
that way. Please be cautious.

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:33.779
If you have questions,
please ask your homeroom teacher.

00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:38.084
Please don't get into trouble
during the two-week period.

00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.597
Though I feel somewhat responsible
as a homeroom teacher...

00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:45.699
...this class is quite
a piece of work....

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:50.463
In my 40s, 16-year-old bride.
In my 40s....

00:07:53.543 --> 00:07:57.775
Welcome home, teacher!
Would you like a bath? Or dinner?

00:07:58.014 --> 00:07:59.447
Age 40

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:00.876
Oh, Yoriko!

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:05.178
Oh, no, not here.
No, teacher!

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:09.885
Every man's dream.
When I am 50, she's in her 20s.

00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:13.095
When I'm 60, she is in her 30s.

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:15.597
The peak of her womanhood.

00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:17.561
Here we are.

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:21.362
Good morning, everyone!

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.175
What a bunch of....
Where am I?!

00:08:31.414 --> 00:08:36.078
16-year-olds-- What is this
frumpy Long Skirt Legion?

00:08:36.586 --> 00:08:40.920
Why aren't there teenagers
with miniskirts and ganguro?

00:08:41.157 --> 00:08:44.058
Onizuka-sensei,
I will leave the rest to you.

00:08:44.293 --> 00:08:46.921
What? Wait!

00:08:49.498 --> 00:08:51.261
I am Onizuka.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.994
I would like to enjoy
the coming two weeks...

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.034
...with you.

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:02.437
You aren't listening. Bastards!

00:09:02.678 --> 00:09:06.205
Damn it! What a bunch of turkeys!

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:12.116
I wanna kill them! If I didn't have
an obligation as a teacher, I would--

00:09:18.761 --> 00:09:22.925
What? What is it?
What do you want from me?

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:28.727
A handshake? Of course, you want
to make friends with me.

00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:32.236
That's cute, though
your face is not cute.

00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:38.176
Good job, Takeda.
Leader of harassing student teachers!

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:42.473
What is it, teacher?
What are you holding?

00:09:42.718 --> 00:09:47.087
-Are you gonna punch someone?
-Hey, way to go!

00:09:47.657 --> 00:09:51.787
Oh, no, are you gonna stop?
Go ahead. Punch me.

00:09:52.028 --> 00:09:54.997
Right here is fine. Do it hard.

00:09:55.631 --> 00:09:59.863
If you do, I'm gonna run
to the board of education!

00:10:00.102 --> 00:10:02.263
We'll also talk to the media!

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:05.065
Teacher.
Excessive corporal punishment!

00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:07.970
The scoop from a real classroom.

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:11.677
That's a great idea!

00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:21.046
What bad luck! Isn't Class O
with a bunch of delinquents?

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.124
I can't stand it.
I might kill them tomorrow.

00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:29.661
Take it easy. I will send
a cute girl along from my class.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:31.560
What about you, Momoi?

00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:35.936
Crappy! The worst bunch of weirdos!

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:39.107
They stare at me and up my skirt.

00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:41.469
That's too bad.

00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:44.639
In my class, the teacher is the worst.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.043
He is pretty annoying.

00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:51.849
The students in my class are all nice.

00:10:52.088 --> 00:10:54.386
I didn't ask you.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.827
I don't know how many are seriously
thinking about becoming teachers.

00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:02.929
But we shouldn't have
much hope for education.

00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:07.295
Kids nowadays are screwed up
with bullying and drugs.

00:11:07.903 --> 00:11:11.498
Teachers should keep their distance
and collect their pay.

00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:15.507
That's right. If you are
too serious, you get screwed.

00:11:18.414 --> 00:11:22.851
A quote from
The Apology for Socrates by Plato:

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:26.543
"I believe that
I don't know what I don't know.

00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:30.122
This simple fact makes me superior."

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:34.295
This statement by Plato is--

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.432
Hey, hey, isn't that
what Socrates said?

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.329
Making mistakes
as if you were a teacher!

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.870
He is just a college student?
Must be from a third-rate college.

00:11:46.108 --> 00:11:48.042
What Socrates is saying....

00:11:48.277 --> 00:11:52.771
Those bastards! Just mumbling away.

00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:57.008
I wish I could kill them.
Kill them!

00:11:57.253 --> 00:11:59.847
-Does anyone understand?
-Yes.

00:12:03.893 --> 00:12:05.121
Oh, you....

00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:09.297
Socrates says that
humility in a truth seeker leads to...

00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:13.525
...proper self-awareness.

00:12:14.336 --> 00:12:17.828
Is that so? Wait.
Oh, yeah. That is correct!

00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:24.303
Thank you for yesterday.
I am glad you came to our class.

00:12:25.648 --> 00:12:29.709
I'm Nanako Mizuki.
Please call me Nana.

00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.118
TEACHER BANZAI

00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:39.327
Oh, she is absolutely awesome.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.437
She is out of this world!

00:12:43.707 --> 00:12:46.733
-Stupid.
-Onizuka there, Ryuji Danma!

00:12:46.977 --> 00:12:49.275
Pay attention
to what I have to say.

00:12:49.513 --> 00:12:53.711
Well, I am sorry to put
a damper on your story...

00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:57.318
...but what Osawa
might have a point.

00:12:57.555 --> 00:12:58.817
What do you mean?

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:02.685
You are the dauntless
and powerful Eikichi.

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:06.761
It's unreasonable to expect
that you'd become a decent teacher.

00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:11.162
I don't think all the young kids
today are screwed up.

00:13:11.402 --> 00:13:13.962
But if you get too involved...

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:18.073
...you might get yourself
in trouble and get fired.

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:23.212
Finally, a path has opened up for me
to become the greatest teacher.

00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:28.407
Leave me alone.
I will keep at it and succeed.

00:13:29.553 --> 00:13:33.250
You used a stand-in to get
your high school certification.

00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:37.393
You should not be talking about it.
I, the teacher, will get mad!

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:45.739
Dear sweet teacher....

00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:49.807
I should hurry home
to get ready for tomorrow.

00:13:52.346 --> 00:13:55.907
You are Mizuki.

00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:00.414
Teacher.

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:11.205
What are you doing here
so late at night?

00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:16.105
I had some trouble with my parents.
So I ran away from home.

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:18.314
I don't have any place to go.

00:14:19.883 --> 00:14:21.714
Ran away? Well, you....

00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:28.975
Teacher, welcome home.
A bath first? Or...?

00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:36.317
A 16-year-old bride!
I don't have to wait till I am 40.

00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:39.048
Teacher, is anything wrong?

00:14:41.593 --> 00:14:42.992
No, nothing.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.156
Let me spend the night at your place.

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:53.670
TEACHER BANZAI

00:14:57.942 --> 00:15:02.538
You must be hungry. Can you wait
while I make sukiyaki for you?

00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.078
The broth for sukiyaki
is hard to perfect.

00:15:07.318 --> 00:15:10.151
You have to be careful
with the meat flavor.

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:12.948
Let me taste.

00:15:14.292 --> 00:15:17.420
Teacher, I won't look.

00:15:17.662 --> 00:15:21.154
Put some comfortable clothes on.

00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:26.826
It would have been nice
if there was a portable stove.

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:31.098
Maybe I will bring one
from home next time.

00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:35.540
Sukiyaki is my favorite food.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.375
Do you not like sukiyaki?

00:15:39.617 --> 00:15:41.915
No, it's not that.

00:15:42.787 --> 00:15:46.382
A bachelor like you probably
wouldn't cook sukiyaki.

00:15:47.392 --> 00:15:51.829
Right. It's kind of hard to cook
sukiyaki for just one person.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.361
That's right.

00:15:58.836 --> 00:15:59.803
My family....

00:16:00.438 --> 00:16:03.669
My dad owns a franchise
of Japanese restaurants.

00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:07.742
And my mom owns
four import goods stores.

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:12.882
Daddy said to have a matchmaking
meeting after I finish college.

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:15.881
He said I should meet
an heir to a huge company.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.180
That's no joke. I don't want to.

00:16:21.726 --> 00:16:24.786
Let me marry Nanako.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:31.891
Sweetie, this is the gross sales
from last month.

00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:35.602
One billion. Less than I expected.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.831
We'll do better next month.

00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:43.005
Why am I having such delusions?

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.011
What's wrong?

00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:52.154
Nothing. So, that's why
you ran away from home?

00:16:53.024 --> 00:16:57.825
I want to be free. I don't want
to return to that house.

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:00.156
Mizuki....

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:05.499
I don't care about anything anymore.

00:17:05.737 --> 00:17:09.104
I wanted to leave such a cold family.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.277
I thought about just obeying them
and accepting an arranged marriage.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.208
I don't know what
to do anymore, teacher.

00:17:24.455 --> 00:17:27.424
What do I do?
I do have these feelings.

00:17:27.658 --> 00:17:29.785
I shouldn't be doing this now.

00:17:30.027 --> 00:17:33.554
But I will probably succeed.

00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:40.836
What's wrong? Are you hot?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.381
Teacher.

00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.483
Sorry!

00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:10.694
I got it! What a scoop!

00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:14.393
What an outrageous thing
you did, Onizuka-sensei!

00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:18.336
We can sell the photos
for megabucks to a magazine.

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:23.104
I'd say, for a million or so.
What are you gonna do, teacher?

00:18:23.347 --> 00:18:25.611
Mizuki, you....

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.685
Teacher, I'm sorry.
They said I would get my share.

00:18:30.922 --> 00:18:33.186
Don't forget to eat the sukiyaki.

00:18:33.424 --> 00:18:37.520
If these photos get out,
you'll never become a teacher.

00:18:37.762 --> 00:18:41.357
We'll give you a week.
Bring us a million yen.

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:45.399
Otherwise, we will scatter
these around.

00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:49.437
He is speechless.

00:18:49.674 --> 00:18:51.164
Mizuki!

00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:54.837
Was this your intention
from the beginning?

00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.947
Was it all acting?

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.914
Why would I go to a teacher for help?

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:09.490
Idiot! You were dreaming.
You are just a teacher.

00:19:10.228 --> 00:19:14.324
See you later. A million, okay?

00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:23.935
The expression on his face
was priceless!

00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:26.638
He looked like a carp
with its gaping mouth.

00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:30.609
Mizuki was excellent.
It was the best acting ever.

00:19:30.848 --> 00:19:35.114
I almost cried just watching her.

00:19:35.353 --> 00:19:39.653
We need to thank her.
Can't beat a million yen.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.355
Too noisy! Your motorcycle!

00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:50.430
What did you say?

00:19:50.668 --> 00:19:56.038
Are you fighting us, the Silver
Fly Trio from Kichijoji East?

00:20:25.127 --> 00:20:29.860
You bastards.
Do you know where you are?

00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:33.891
Are you saying we are noisy
at our own meeting place?

00:20:34.937 --> 00:20:38.373
So how are you gonna settle this?

00:20:38.874 --> 00:20:42.833
We didn't know.
Please forgive us.

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:46.674
Didn't know? You must be
underestimating us.

00:21:00.835 --> 00:21:02.530
Onizuka!

00:21:09.944 --> 00:21:11.419
That's....

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:21.784
Stop it. Don't challenge him!

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:23.356
Boss!

00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:28.553
He is Eikichi Onizuka, of the
legendary Onibaku Group from Shonan.

00:21:29.713 --> 00:21:32.511
He destroyed
the legendary Midnight Angel!

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.184
Did you know?

00:21:35.953 --> 00:21:37.944
Please excuse us.

00:21:38.188 --> 00:21:41.021
What have you done to them?

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:43.852
Nothing. Not yet....

00:21:45.351 --> 00:21:48.718
Is that so? Good.

00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:50.354
Teacher!

00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:53.892
These guys are...

00:21:55.308 --> 00:21:56.297
...my...

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:01.389
...prey!

00:22:07.187 --> 00:22:08.882
Lift them up!

00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:20.993
How do you like the pond water
in Inokashira Park? Isn't it good?

00:22:21.468 --> 00:22:24.062
Please don't kill us, Onizuka-sensei.

00:22:24.304 --> 00:22:27.432
Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you.

00:22:27.674 --> 00:22:32.941
We haven't done the crotch-splitter,
burning-at-the-stake or sandbag hell yet.

00:22:33.213 --> 00:22:36.046
You are a teacher, aren't you?

00:22:36.282 --> 00:22:39.183
How could you torture your students?

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:40.909
No whining!

00:22:41.254 --> 00:22:46.419
You call me teacher and become
my students when it's convenient.

00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:50.618
Don't underestimate me, you bastards!
Teachers are human too.

00:22:50.864 --> 00:22:54.925
They have times when they get mad
and blow their tops!

00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:58.797
Besides, I am not
officially a teacher yet.

00:23:14.687 --> 00:23:17.588
Forgive us.
We will never do it again.

00:23:18.258 --> 00:23:22.490
Why don't we take down
the barrier just once?

00:23:25.098 --> 00:23:29.467
The annoying barrier between
a teacher and student.

00:23:32.272 --> 00:23:35.332
It all depends on
the relationship between people.

00:23:35.575 --> 00:23:37.941
But if one side whines...

00:23:38.178 --> 00:23:41.375
...the relationship
does not hold water.

00:23:41.614 --> 00:23:44.708
You wipe your own ass.

00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:49.979
That's the attitude
we all should have as humans.

00:23:51.124 --> 00:23:53.115
Teacher!

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.129
Okay, let's keep going!

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.868
You bastards! If I don't get to be
a teacher, it would be all your fault.

00:24:03.103 --> 00:24:07.472
I will show you a living hell
for the rest of your life.

00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:12.067
Here are your draft beers.

00:24:12.312 --> 00:24:14.177
Wow, unbelievable.

00:24:14.414 --> 00:24:18.851
Then you hung them upside down in
Inokashira Park on Saturday night?

00:24:19.085 --> 00:24:22.714
I don't believe it's something
a teacher would do.

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:24.924
By Monday it'll be big news.

00:24:25.258 --> 00:24:28.887
-Maybe I will get fired.
-No question about it, stupid!

00:24:29.129 --> 00:24:34.294
Where in the world would you find
a teacher who tortures his students?

00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:39.330
16-year-old bride at the age of 40.

00:24:41.074 --> 00:24:42.666
What are you gonna do?

00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:46.572
Everyone is panicking
because there aren't enough jobs.

00:24:46.813 --> 00:24:49.111
Who'd hire a former gang member...

00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:54.514
...and third-rate college graduate
with a history of violence?

00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:00.049
Maybe they would.

00:25:00.293 --> 00:25:05.754
Those yakuza scouts seem to be looking
at you with intense interest.

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:10.997
Don't look!
If our eyes meet, I'll get hired.

00:25:11.237 --> 00:25:13.205
Thank you for coming!

00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:18.167
Are you okay?

00:25:18.978 --> 00:25:22.209
Why are you so eager to be a teacher?

00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:24.746
You should give up.

00:25:24.984 --> 00:25:28.283
Teachers don't get paid well
and have many problems.

00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:31.854
Maybe it was a good thing.
Those annoying kids...

00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.559
...you couldn't have left them alone.

00:25:35.028 --> 00:25:36.928
You are amazing.

00:25:37.263 --> 00:25:40.096
Since we came to Tokyo
six years ago...

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:44.235
...you graduated
from professional school...

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.064
...got certified
and become a store manager.

00:25:47.307 --> 00:25:50.367
You are making your dreams come true.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.704
But me, I have been....

00:25:55.215 --> 00:25:57.012
Why are you showing weakness?

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.081
It's not like you.
You were called Eikichi the Evil.

00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:04.015
Whining don't match your image.

00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:07.992
When we first came to Tokyo,
we promised....

00:26:09.128 --> 00:26:11.062
I know, I know.

00:26:24.043 --> 00:26:26.375
I bet I'm fired.

00:26:26.879 --> 00:26:28.779
Onizuka-sensei!

00:26:29.015 --> 00:26:32.348
-Here he comes.
-What did you do?

00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:33.847
Here we go.

00:26:34.087 --> 00:26:38.023
-We are absolutely stunned. Really.
-I knew it.

00:26:38.258 --> 00:26:43.423
-You are a very promising teacher!
-It'd be nice if I could ask them...

00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:48.965
... to pretend that
they heard nothing about it.

00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:50.931
I understand.

00:26:51.671 --> 00:26:52.638
What?!

00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:57.605
Like I said, our principal said
he'd like you to join our faculty.

00:26:57.844 --> 00:27:00.312
Well, we were so amazed to hear...

00:27:00.546 --> 00:27:05.176
...that those delinquent students
would clean the school...

00:27:05.418 --> 00:27:10.082
...because they respect you
and they want you to become a teacher.

00:27:10.523 --> 00:27:15.324
What did you do to transform them
into such good students?

00:27:15.728 --> 00:27:17.389
Attention, everyone!

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.758
Onizuka-sensei has arrived!

00:27:21.734 --> 00:27:24.168
Good morning, Onizuka-sensei!

00:27:24.404 --> 00:27:26.702
Good morning!

00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:29.567
Please tell me
what you did, Onizuka-sensei.

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:32.676
Teacher, thank you very much
for yesterday.

00:27:32.912 --> 00:27:35.278
What you told us was very moving!

00:27:36.015 --> 00:27:40.213
Well, just a little bit
of tough love.

00:27:42.422 --> 00:27:45.414
Did you hear about
the student teacher in Class O?

00:27:45.892 --> 00:27:50.693
You mean he salvaged
that delinquent Class O?

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.295
Amazing!

00:27:52.532 --> 00:27:55.831
He can't be an ordinary guy
to rehabilitate them.

00:27:56.069 --> 00:28:00.199
That's right. I heard he used
to be in a hot-rod gang.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.237
Really?

00:28:03.676 --> 00:28:07.772
Okay, that's good. Next. Watanabe.

00:28:09.482 --> 00:28:14.078
Thank you for your hard work
today, Onizuka-sensei!

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.612
We would appreciate
your instruction tomorrow.

00:28:17.857 --> 00:28:21.759
It's awesome you tamed them so well.
You did a great job.

00:28:21.994 --> 00:28:23.120
You think so?

00:28:23.796 --> 00:28:29.166
The whole school is talking about you,
about the amazing student teacher.

00:28:29.402 --> 00:28:32.462
I envy you.
You're the principal's favorite.

00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:35.606
You've pretty much secured your job.

00:28:35.842 --> 00:28:37.833
No, no. It's not that.

00:28:38.077 --> 00:28:41.478
You might be a better teacher
than you think.

00:28:41.714 --> 00:28:45.445
Me? I don't know.

00:28:45.685 --> 00:28:49.382
If you say so.
You could be right.

00:28:49.622 --> 00:28:53.558
See you. I'm pretty busy too.

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:58.621
Teacher.

00:28:58.865 --> 00:29:02.301
It's becoming reality, seriously.

00:29:02.535 --> 00:29:07.837
If I don't cause trouble, I'll secure
the teaching position of my dreams.

00:29:12.311 --> 00:29:13.676
Yoo-poo!

00:29:17.056 --> 00:29:18.023
Yoo-poo!

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:23.961
What the hell is "yoo-poo"?
Say it correctly.

00:29:24.196 --> 00:29:28.428
Oops! You are acting
a little cold, teacher.

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.965
Don't bug me. Go away.

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:34.866
That's too bad.
Nana wanted to praise you.

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.631
Praise?

00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:42.243
I'm the one who developed
that torture-a-teacher trap!

00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:46.315
Usually, the victim stops
coming to school...

00:29:46.552 --> 00:29:48.645
...or he would pay the money.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.447
You are awesome, teacher.
I commend you.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.558
Someone like you is called a devil.
Hurry home.

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:00.027
I don't have time for games.

00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:09.430
Hey! You are really irritating me!

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:12.439
Teacher, don't you wanna come
to my house?

00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:15.579
-Absolutely not. No way.
-Here.

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:24.488
If you come, I will give you
panties fresh off my butt!

00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:27.419
Fresh off your....

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:30.718
No! Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old.

00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:34.430
This is a trap. Get her off!

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:39.365
But if I keep going,
the wind will lift up her miniskirt...

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:43.302
... and she's not wearing....

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:49.976
It feels good to ride a motorcycle!

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.711
What is she up to?

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:57.547
Why is she inviting me to her house?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.354
I wonder if there is more
to that trap.

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.289
Yeah, that's it. That must be it!

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:10.796
No, don't be fooled, Eikichi Onizuka,
22 years old.

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.368
I won't fall for a young girl,
even without underwear.

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.836
I won't fall for what's
under that skirt.

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:20.704
I won't, I won't.

00:31:21.013 --> 00:31:24.176
What are you expecting, teacher?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.480
Could it be this?

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:32.281
You are blushing. How cute!

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:40.496
Wow, what a huge house!

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.257
Is beer okay?
Make yourself comfortable!

00:31:45.304 --> 00:31:48.796
I don't touch anything, even
if I stretch my arms and legs!

00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:53.637
It's like a showroom.
There is no dust on the floor.

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:57.178
A maid comes in twice a week
to clean the house.

00:31:57.983 --> 00:32:00.884
Your family is rich for real.

00:32:01.487 --> 00:32:04.217
That's not important.
Here is your beer.

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:11.796
Thanks! But I don't trust you yet.

00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:17.726
Just because you are rich doesn't mean
you can manipulate me with money.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.768
I will not sell my soul
for small change.

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:26.433
Wow, sushi!
Are you having guests today?

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.112
-That must be for me.
-Yours?

00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:31.748
I'll be late. Eat this.
Mom

00:32:31.984 --> 00:32:34.009
Look, it's Chu-toro!
And Oh-toro!

00:32:34.253 --> 00:32:38.019
Isn't this a super-deluxe combo?

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.754
Hey, Mizuki!

00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:46.226
You're not gonna eat this
by yourself, are you?

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:50.925
For the sake of our relationship,
I will be happy with Oh-toro.

00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:56.536
No, you can have Oh-toro.
Maybe you can give me Chu-toro.

00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:15.559
Oh-toro, sea urchin, salmon roe!

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:20.925
Shit! It got mixed with garbage
when the trash can fell.

00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:23.694
Let's go for a drive!

00:33:23.936 --> 00:33:28.635
It felt so good to ride a motorcycle.
Please, please, please!

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:32.605
I might be able to save some
if I look carefully.

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:43.847
Please, let me spend
the night at your place.

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:48.788
Oh-toro is the fatty part
of tuna's belly.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:53.555
The ones from black tunas caught
offshore in Hokkaido during winter...

00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:55.197
...are the best.

00:33:55.434 --> 00:33:58.403
Please let me spend the night.
Just tonight!

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:02.095
Black tunas between 86 and 150 kg...

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:06.741
...are less stringy and considered
most suitable for sushi.

00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:11.780
Now it is considered king
of nigiri sushi.

00:34:22.995 --> 00:34:26.761
Please, please,
I don't want to go home.

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:30.332
The smooth flavor and texture
delights gourmets...

00:34:30.602 --> 00:34:32.729
...all over the world.

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:34.905
Teacher!

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.871
Don't nag me.
What were you thinking?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.527
You're crazy! What the hell?!

00:35:03.769 --> 00:35:06.237
I don't want to go home!

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:12.341
I would rather die than go home.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.534
I'm sorry.

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:31.442
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

00:35:34.452 --> 00:35:37.751
Did you eat sukiyaki I made
for you the other night?

00:35:38.322 --> 00:35:41.450
I don't waste food.

00:35:43.027 --> 00:35:46.292
We used to cook sukiyaki a lot.

00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:50.128
Those days, we were living
in a tiny apartment.

00:35:50.368 --> 00:35:53.860
The payday once a month
was sukiyaki day.

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:57.097
That day, my mom bought
meat and vegetables...

00:35:57.341 --> 00:35:59.775
...from the grocery store
where she worked.

00:36:00.311 --> 00:36:03.610
I would wait with my dad
for her to come home...

00:36:03.848 --> 00:36:06.646
...and cook dinner together.

00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:10.577
I enjoyed it very much.

00:36:10.822 --> 00:36:14.815
But I think my dad
and mom didn't like it.

00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:19.821
So my dad opened a restaurant
and my mom studied to get a license.

00:36:20.064 --> 00:36:24.626
They started working a lot
and built a company.

00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:27.831
We moved to a bigger house.

00:36:28.072 --> 00:36:32.532
I was given my own room. And my dad
had a room and my mom had a room.

00:36:32.777 --> 00:36:37.578
After a while, we stopped eating
sukiyaki together.

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:39.839
Funny, isn't it?

00:36:40.084 --> 00:36:44.350
I thought it'd be more fun
if we lived in a bigger house.

00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:48.025
My dad and mom worked hard for it.

00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:53.455
Our house now has a thick wall
between his room and her room.

00:36:53.698 --> 00:36:56.599
The wall is very cold
if you touch it.

00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:02.466
Nanako, when we become rich someday,
we will live in a huge house.

00:37:02.773 --> 00:37:07.142
That's right. We will have a yard
and put in a swing set.

00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:10.404
We'll build your own room too.

00:37:10.815 --> 00:37:14.615
-Really? Are you sure?
-Of course!

00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:22.849
Teacher, I wonder what happened.

00:37:25.963 --> 00:37:28.488
I lied about
that arranged-marriage meeting.

00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:32.169
I want to go back to those days:

00:37:33.104 --> 00:37:37.939
My dad, my mom and myself...

00:37:40.311 --> 00:37:43.007
...in that tiny apartment.

00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:47.611
I don't want to see
that thick, cold wall anymore.

00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:51.083
Why are you whining
about a wall or two?

00:37:51.889 --> 00:37:55.586
In my apartment,
a young couple lives next door.

00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:58.886
I can hear their giggles
and moaning. How I envy--

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.428
No, that's irrelevant.

00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:04.128
We cannot....

00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:10.399
We cannot go back to the past
no matter how much we try.

00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:18.576
No matter how wonderful it was,
the past is nothing but the past.

00:38:20.117 --> 00:38:21.880
That's so....

00:38:22.587 --> 00:38:26.546
Mizuki, go back to your house.

00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:32.919
Teacher!

00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:38.831
Stupid! I hope you get killed!

00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:49.340
Okay, that will be fine.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.380
This is a rare occasion.
You never come home this early.

00:38:53.618 --> 00:38:56.416
What's gotten into you?

00:38:57.588 --> 00:39:01.285
-There was a call from your store.
-Where is Nanako?

00:39:05.463 --> 00:39:07.021
Nanako? Nanako!

00:39:07.265 --> 00:39:10.564
I always tell you to take
your calls in your own room.

00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:15.397
Look who's talking. Don't give out
our home number to weird women.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.973
-Wasn't her name Mitsuko?
-She is a client!

00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:24.371
-Yeah, right!
-What do you mean?

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.489
Yes? What is it?

00:39:33.324 --> 00:39:37.784
What's wrong? What's the yelling
about? Hey, who are you?

00:39:51.504 --> 00:39:56.237
I'm a teacher.
Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old.

00:39:56.476 --> 00:39:59.673
I came to pay a visit
to my student's house.

00:40:00.146 --> 00:40:02.376
Teacher?

00:40:03.149 --> 00:40:06.312
That's a lie. There is no way
you could be a teacher!

00:40:06.553 --> 00:40:07.747
Teacher!

00:40:10.056 --> 00:40:11.023
What?

00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:14.092
Where are you going? Hey!

00:40:14.327 --> 00:40:17.490
You're a teacher at Nanako's school?

00:40:18.965 --> 00:40:21.297
Hey, wait a minute!

00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:26.869
-I'm gonna call the police!
-Is this it?

00:40:27.741 --> 00:40:29.299
Stop!

00:40:29.643 --> 00:40:33.511
-Wait, aren't you a teacher?
-Are you listening?

00:40:34.047 --> 00:40:35.878
Say something!

00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:37.606
Nanako!

00:40:39.285 --> 00:40:41.651
Mizuki, is this the one?

00:40:41.888 --> 00:40:45.449
Is this the wall
you were talking about?

00:40:45.859 --> 00:40:47.952
-Yes.
-Nanako!

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:51.957
What do you want? Money?

00:40:52.565 --> 00:40:55.193
We have no cash here!

00:41:03.009 --> 00:41:05.944
Stop! What are you doing?

00:41:07.914 --> 00:41:11.816
Have you gone insane?
Aren't you a teacher?

00:41:12.585 --> 00:41:14.485
Let's call the police!

00:41:18.658 --> 00:41:22.253
Nanako, come over here! Nanako!

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:21.211
See, Mizuki? The wall you hated...

00:42:22.355 --> 00:42:24.880
...I destroyed it for you!

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:49.010
Now you take it from here.

00:42:56.756 --> 00:42:58.519
Hello, police?

00:42:58.758 --> 00:43:02.091
Please come right away!
A strange man is here--

00:43:02.595 --> 00:43:06.861
-Nanako, what are you doing?
-Hey, you, wait a minute!

00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:10.330
Let go, Nanako! Nanako!

00:43:11.104 --> 00:43:12.628
Wait!

00:43:21.815 --> 00:43:26.411
Well, everyone, it was short,
but it was a good experience.

00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:32.381
I will keep striving to become
the greatest teacher in Japan.

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:34.450
Thank you.

00:43:36.029 --> 00:43:38.657
You are the best, Onizuka-sensei!

00:43:38.898 --> 00:43:42.493
Bonehead guys! Why are you
so attached to a teacher?

00:43:42.735 --> 00:43:44.202
Shut up!

00:43:44.437 --> 00:43:49.704
Onizuka-sensei is awesome!

00:43:51.444 --> 00:43:54.208
It's finally over, student teaching.

00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:56.542
How was it?

00:43:57.383 --> 00:44:00.318
Everyone, look at this!

00:44:01.254 --> 00:44:04.781
My students gave me
such a wonderful....

00:44:05.258 --> 00:44:10.753
I have never been moved like this
in my entire life!

00:44:10.997 --> 00:44:12.760
What happened to Osawa-kun?

00:44:12.999 --> 00:44:17.265
I heard that he was expelled
because he seduced a student.

00:44:17.537 --> 00:44:19.198
I am not surprised.

00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:23.876
Well, we will have to do
a good job starting in April.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:27.170
Didn't you say you didn't
want to be a teacher?

00:44:28.014 --> 00:44:33.111
I promised my students
that I will be back in April.

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:36.081
Now, someone is motivated!

00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:42.989
Dear teacher:
Thank you for the other day.

00:44:43.529 --> 00:44:46.020
After, we were busy
with the police...

00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:49.565
...and with having family meetings.

00:44:49.969 --> 00:44:53.598
My dad and mom were
very upset at first.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.070
But now, they don't want to fight.

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:59.904
Thanks to that, we have
more time to spend together.

00:45:00.947 --> 00:45:03.575
On top of that...

00:45:03.816 --> 00:45:06.080
... I witnessed...

00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:11.154
... my dad and mom smiling at each
other through the hole in the wall.

00:45:11.391 --> 00:45:14.224
They looked a little embarrassed.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.830
But, as soon as the wall was fixed,
they stopped talking again.

00:45:20.366 --> 00:45:22.391
But it will be fine.

00:45:23.269 --> 00:45:27.672
This time I will destroy the wall
between them in their hearts.

00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:31.343
Little by little,
no matter how long it may take...

00:45:31.577 --> 00:45:32.771
...I will do it.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.701
It was fun, teacher!

00:45:37.747 --> 00:45:42.616
Make sure you become a teacher!

00:45:43.186 --> 00:45:47.213
I will remain a virgin
and wait for you!

00:45:47.857 --> 00:45:51.987
You should be 10 years older
to say that, kid!

00:45:52.362 --> 00:45:55.854
You're not taking me seriously.
Then....

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.672
See?

00:46:12.782 --> 00:46:14.272
Great.

00:46:15.184 --> 00:46:20.781
TEACHER BANZAI

00:46:31.511 --> 00:46:35.675
You and me, let's go away

00:46:35.949 --> 00:46:40.886
To look for new emotions today

00:46:41.121 --> 00:46:45.956
Together we can overcome

00:46:46.226 --> 00:46:51.892
Because I want to enjoy a new tomorrow

00:46:52.165 --> 00:46:56.295
Open your eyes and open the door

00:46:57.104 --> 00:47:01.507
The world in front of your eyes

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:07.110
I want to go out
With my favorite sounds

00:47:07.514 --> 00:47:11.712
I will taste my childhood emotions

00:47:12.986 --> 00:47:22.520
I'm here to enjoy the sunlight

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:32.471
I'm enjoying myself
More than in the past

00:47:32.706 --> 00:47:36.938
I want to see you, but I can't

00:47:37.177 --> 00:47:42.046
So I just embrace my love

00:47:42.282 --> 00:47:47.117
Even walking on a crowded street

00:47:47.354 --> 00:47:53.725
Your smile makes my head spin

00:48:04.538 --> 00:48:08.065
-PREVIEW
-Why are you looking at me like that?

00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:08.865
EIKICHI ONIZUKA

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:10.804
-HIROSHI UCHIYAMADA
-What?

00:48:11.044 --> 00:48:13.535
-AZUSA FUYUTSUKI
-I'm so nervous.

00:48:18.952 --> 00:48:21.648
Now, I will be GDO.
