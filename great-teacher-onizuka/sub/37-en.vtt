WELCOME TO OKINAWA

00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:52.273
It's hot! What's with this sun?!

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.756
It goes right through my skin!

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:58.333
It's great! Okinawa isn't like Japan.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.243
Really. The color of the green
leaves and blue sky...

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:04.338
...are completely
different from Tokyo.

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:07.708
Among the Okinawa Islands,
we are on Ishigaki Island.

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:10.344
The average temperature
is 24 degrees Celsius...

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:12.949
...and the average
humidity is 74 percent.

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:16.517
Relatively speaking, the island
is closer to a subtropical zone.

00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.519
Yes. And the towns were designed...

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.428
...based on Fusui
(geographical fortune reading).

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.827
Certainly, it is influenced...

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.028
...by Chinese culture rather
than Japanese. That means...

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:30.369
Can't you two just enjoy this
like the rest of us?

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:33.440
All right. Please listen up...

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.709
Listen. This is part of class.

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:42.080
Be sure to act as good students.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.949
Don't lose control.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:57.098
I'm sorry. I guess this misfired.

00:02:58.103 --> 00:03:02.563
Onizuka! What's with your outfit?!
We didn't come here to play!

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:06.041
What are you talking about?
Of course we came here to play!

00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.973
Otherwise, why would we come
to a terribly hot place like this?

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:12.675
I can't believe you are.!

00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:16.819
Wait. How can you speak
like that to the sponsor of this trip?

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.050
Sponsor?

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:23.726
I wonder whom we owe
for such a luxurious school trip?

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.689
Hey, everyone! Who is that?!

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.659
Onizuka!

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.164
All right! Everyone! Lose control!

00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:35.762
And let's have
a memorable summer!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.976
- Yeah!
- No! Don't give in to his temptation!

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.443
This is a school trip!
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.917
Wow! Can we stay
at such a posh hotel?!

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.543
This is super luxurious.

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.718
Hey, everyone. We have time
until the rooms are assigned.

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:56.518
Shall we go to the ocean?!

00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:01.128
It's a blue sea! With a coral reef!

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.288
- Hey, Kikuchi...
- Oh, no!

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.367
Yeah...?

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:05.265
- After all, she didn't come...
- I brought only my school swimsuit.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.564
I mean Miyabi...

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:09.770
- Right...
- Hurry up! Let's go!

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:16.740
Hey, watch where
you're walking, Yoshikawa!

00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:18.145
You're really dumb!

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.210
Sorry...

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.514
Don't say "sorry." Say "I'm sorry."

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:25.511
I'm sorry.

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:30.552
Wait...

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.125
It's not a good idea, Anko.
He's on Onizuka's side.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:38.932
If he tattles, you'll get paid back.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.199
It doesn't matter.

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:44.031
I can't stand someone like him...

00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:46.940
...who depends on
someone else for protection.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.805
If he wants to tattle, let him!

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:51.779
Wow! What a radical statement!

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:00.020
"A Boy Riding on a Dolphin"
by Michiru Jo!

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:21.605
Teacher? Is this
how to make a sunshine tattoo?

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:23.840
No, no! You have to paint harder!

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:25.677
Otherwise,
you can't shut out the sun.

00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:27.151
Wow!

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:28.719
Look at mine, teacher!

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.552
- Wow! That's good!
- Teacher. Draw mine, too!

00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:34.284
All right. Wait a minute.

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:38.287
What are you doing, Onizuka-sensei?

00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:42.522
Sunshine tattoos.
When I was little, I did this a lot.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:47.071
Wow, it looks fun. I wonder
if you can draw one for me...

00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:50.034
Sure. What would you like?

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.573
Can I get letters?

00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:53.108
Whatever you like!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.109
Well, it's a little embarrassing...

00:05:56.347 --> 00:05:59.043
...but can you write
"Love" on my arm...?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.740
Love?!

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.748
Are you serious?! You're not
a junior high student anymore.!

00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:07.290
It's embarrassing, teacher!

00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:09.587
You don't need to laugh at me!

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:11.659
You said I could get whatever.!

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:15.457
Hey, hey, hey! What's that?

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:18.194
A tattoo?
Please draw one on me, too!

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:21.937
Oh, Murai. You already have one.

00:06:22.273 --> 00:06:24.207
You've got
a special one on your back.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:30.547
What's this?!

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.343
That's great!

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:36.545
Now it's too embarrassing to swim!

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:39.780
Move!

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.090
They're so stupid!
They aren't kids anymore!

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:52.164
Hey! Yoshikawa!

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:55.536
What is it, Uehara-san?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.542
Well, I'm thirsty. Can you go
and buy me juice? 100% grapefruit.

00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:03.470
I want orange juice.

00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:05.741
I want apple cider. Thanks!

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:09.048
Well, sure...

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.786
What's the matter?
Why don't you go?

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:14.224
Ah, the money...

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:17.924
Are you going to let girls pay?

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:20.923
That's terrible! He's the worst!

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:23.429
He'll never, ever get a girl.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.031
There.
That's what you wanted, right?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.205
I'm counting on you, Boy!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.046
Hurry up, please!

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:42.379
It's fun to pick on him.
He always obeys what we say.

00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.494
School trips are really tough.

00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:00.337
Even here at a resort,
I'm really tired.

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:04.440
This year's third-year students
are especially restless.

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:07.204
It was easy to handle
the students last year...

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:12.678
How about going out on the town
for an "overview meeting" tonight?

00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:18.215
I've just heard at the front desk.
There is an interesting store...

00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:21.954
An interesting store...?
I don't think it's a good idea...

00:08:22.193 --> 00:08:25.993
Don't worry. Once in a while,
teachers need to have fun!

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.395
- Right, Vice Principal?
- That's right!

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:31.668
So what kind of store is it?

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:36.567
What's that?

00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:38.073
Room assignments.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.244
Room assignments?
You haven't done it yet?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.378
Well, we're at a resort.
So I'm rearranging them.

00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:51.677
I've thought this may not
be interesting enough...

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:57.895
Now we're going to be giving you
your room assignments.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.726
After receiving
a printout for each class...

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:03.560
... please take your
baggage to your room.

00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:04.992
Do you understand?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.668
Excuse me, teacher...

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.635
I can't find my room...

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.038
What? You were forgotten?
How uncool!

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.447
It sounds like Yoshikawa!

00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:22.482
His existence is almost invisible.!

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:28.722
What are you talking about?
Yoshikawa, you have your name...

00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:30.217
...right here.

00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:35.065
Your name is in the same room
as Anko and the others.

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:37.133
What did you say?!

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:41.094
Wow! It's true!
Here is Yoshikawa's name.!

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.101
What does this mean?!

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:45.368
Why is a boy in the girls' room?!

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.435
That's all right once in a while.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.774
That's not all right!

00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:53.213
What?! In my room,
the others are all boys!

00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:57.380
Wow! We're in the same room
as Kikuchi and Murai!

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:00.887
Boys and girls are all mixed up!

00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:03.925
What are you thinking?
Boys and girls together in the rooms!

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:06.494
Please explain this, teacher!

00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:10.289
It will be interesting.

00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:14.932
Onizuka-sensei...

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.965
Oh, look! Kanzaki-san!

00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:20.737
This room number!
Don't you notice something?!

00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:22.139
What is it?

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:26.842
It's "0080."
"0080 War in the Pocket."

00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:29.246
You haven't seen Gundam's OVA?

00:10:29.387 --> 00:10:31.480
- No...
- It's a masterpiece!

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.224
Especially in the scene where
Bernie went in with Zaku II Kai...

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:35.925
... it is melancholy...

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.719
By the way,
which episode do you like best?

00:10:41.132 --> 00:10:43.464
Based on your answer,
we'll know all about you.

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:46.362
It's like a blood type reading.

00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:49.606
Yeah, it's "Gundam reading."
I did it, too.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.409
If you like Zeta, you have
a desire for destruction...

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.411
Really? Then how about G?

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:57.309
Those who watch it are kids.

00:10:58.316 --> 00:10:59.943
That's Char.

00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:01.348
You noticed it?!

00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:06.923
Hey, why don't we guess
which one Kanzaki-san likes?

00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:11.857
My guess is Bright Hassaway.
That's really dark...

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:15.391
Yeah. I've read the book.

00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:18.064
I recorded the tapes in 8mm...

00:11:18.202 --> 00:11:19.931
...so let's have a Gundam Screening
to watch them.

00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:22.562
Oh, Kanzaki-san will like it, too!

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.672
No! I don't like this room!

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:29.473
I don't understand what
they're saying! Not at all!

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:38.781
AWAMORI SIIZA ANISEN EN
(AWAMORI CAESAR 2000 YEN)

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:45.850
Do you understand?
Don't come on this side of the table!

00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:48.995
If you do, we'll scream
"Sexual Molester!"

00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:52.756
Why do we need to sleep
in such a small area?!

00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:57.129
Why are you making such a fuss?
If you're a man, take it!

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.000
You complain too much!

00:11:59.107 --> 00:12:00.802
You are narrow-minded!

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.771
What?! You're the ones
who are narrow-minded!

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:03.845
Sexual Molester!

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.577
What's with this
room arrangement?!

00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:07.739
It's terrible!

00:12:08.483 --> 00:12:12.510
That's right! Especially if we have
to be with Onizuka's henchmen.

00:12:12.888 --> 00:12:17.450
Then you shouldn't
have come, like Aizawa!

00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:22.526
Darn Onizuka!
What was he thinking?!

00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.121
He put us with Saeko.!

00:12:26.902 --> 00:12:28.460
What are you doing?

00:12:28.603 --> 00:12:30.935
I've never heard of boys
and girls in the same rooms.

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:36.405
Do you understand this school trip
is part of class?! Class!

00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:42.081
Then it shouldn't be a problem.
They always have class together.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.083
What logic! What are you going
to do if something happens?!

00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:52.021
Anyway, Class 4 has
their own way of doing things.

00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:54.360
What kind of attitude is that?!

00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:01.525
I'll make sure they have
a memorable time.

00:13:01.903 --> 00:13:04.030
Why is he deciding by himself?

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.101
This isn't good.

00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:11.110
If the parents find out about this,
it will be a big problem...

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.641
That's all right.

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:14.112
The one who has to take
responsibility for this...

00:13:14.282 --> 00:13:15.977
...is Onizuka-sensei...

00:13:23.091 --> 00:13:26.083
From now on,
I'll let you sleep in this room.

00:13:26.761 --> 00:13:28.251
Room...?

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.391
This is a balcony...

00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:33.625
Shut up!
It's nice to have a roof, right?

00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:35.897
But how about a toilet...?

00:13:36.004 --> 00:13:36.971
Why don't you do it from here?

00:13:37.072 --> 00:13:38.039
No way...

00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:42.537
If you want to blame someone,
blame Onizuka!

00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:45.142
Done with cleaning garbage!

00:13:45.347 --> 00:13:46.575
Ah, it's cool.!

00:13:46.748 --> 00:13:48.943
Hey, who takes a bath first?

00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:52.918
It's terrible, teacher...
To arrange our rooms like this...

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:02.527
I don't want to sleep here.

00:14:03.298 --> 00:14:05.732
I feel like a ghost may appear...

00:14:09.504 --> 00:14:12.530
Shhhh! Be quiet!

00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:22.242
Don't surprise me, teacher!
You're not a bat!

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.214
So how is the school trip
during nighttime?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.015
Are you enjoying it?

00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:29.446
Do I look like I'm enjoying it?

00:14:30.158 --> 00:14:34.822
Because of you, I have to fight off
mosquitoes while sleeping tonight.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.298
If I get malaria, it's your fault.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.634
Don't think so negatively.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:47.039
You're with the girls!
Why don't you enjoy it just a little bit?!

00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:49.370
Don't you understand
how thoughtful I am?

00:14:50.045 --> 00:14:52.946
Under these circumstances,
how can I enjoy myself?

00:14:53.114 --> 00:14:57.949
Don't you understand? There are
many ways. For example...

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.353
...observing a woman's body...

00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:06.658
Look at them!

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:09.457
They've thought they kicked
you out, and they're relaxing.

00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:11.259
Wow! She's taking off her bra!

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:15.631
It isn't good, teacher!
If they find out you're doing it...

00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:19.234
Don't worry.
I'll let you see this soon...

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:22.339
No... I don't...

00:15:24.512 --> 00:15:26.173
- You!
- No...

00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:28.010
Don't worry. Don't be shy.!

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:30.980
It's not every day that
you see something like this!

00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:32.144
That is...

00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:41.489
What are you peeping at?!
You pervert!

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.688
No, no! I was tempted by the devil...

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:47.529
The devil?

00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:57.977
There is no such thing!
Don't make such a stupid excuse!

00:15:58.713 --> 00:16:01.079
If you peep again,
I won't forgive you!

00:16:10.925 --> 00:16:11.949
Here!

00:16:13.128 --> 00:16:15.062
Whew! That was close!

00:16:16.097 --> 00:16:19.328
You're terrible. You hid without me.

00:16:19.934 --> 00:16:22.095
It's all my fault...

00:16:22.203 --> 00:16:26.663
You are pitiful!
You let the girls pick on you.

00:16:27.275 --> 00:16:29.072
Why don't you take
revenge a little bit?

00:16:29.544 --> 00:16:31.637
Of course I can't!

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.576
They outnumber me and are taller
than I am. There is no way I can win.

00:16:36.785 --> 00:16:40.881
I'm telling you to show them
that you're a man!

00:16:41.222 --> 00:16:44.487
If you can't win physically,
use your head! Right?!

00:16:44.626 --> 00:16:45.854
Use your head!

00:16:46.027 --> 00:16:47.892
For example, how...?

00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:50.728
Let's see...

00:16:51.332 --> 00:16:52.356
For example...

00:16:52.901 --> 00:16:55.597
...how about hanging yourself...?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:56.994
What?!

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:07.644
Hey, Anko. Isn't it better
to let Yoshikawa in the room?

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:09.984
I think we went too far...

00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:11.052
Why?

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.018
Because it will be a problem...

00:17:13.188 --> 00:17:15.315
...if he tried to commit
suicide like last time...

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.989
What are you worrying about?
There is no way he'll die!

00:17:19.594 --> 00:17:22.757
Onizuka can't always help him.

00:17:23.698 --> 00:17:25.461
If he had that much courage...

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.793
...he would have been
dead a long time ago.

00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:28.532
But...

00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:42.138
No! He's hanging himself!

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.217
No way!

00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:45.309
That's why I told you!
We went too far!

00:17:46.087 --> 00:17:49.853
It has nothing to do with me!
It's your fault! Your fault!

00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:54.127
Anyway, we have to help him!
There may still be time!

00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:01.096
He isn't here.

00:18:01.302 --> 00:18:04.032
No way! I was certain just now...

00:18:04.172 --> 00:18:05.639
We didn't see it right...

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.807
How...?

00:18:06.908 --> 00:18:08.307
Because he isn't here!

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.479
The rope might be cut
and he might have fallen down...

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:13.672
Check it, Anko!

00:18:13.782 --> 00:18:15.044
Why me?!

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.052
It's your fault! You're the one
who kicked him out to the balcony!

00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:21.315
You were enjoying it, too!

00:18:21.422 --> 00:18:23.185
Anyway, hurry up!

00:18:23.525 --> 00:18:27.689
All right... I'll look, okay?!

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.632
Even if I see Yoshikawa's body,
I won't get scared...

00:18:33.468 --> 00:18:34.526
How is it?

00:18:34.702 --> 00:18:36.499
He isn't there.

00:18:37.272 --> 00:18:38.466
It's strange...

00:18:54.989 --> 00:18:56.354
No! Don't come closer!

00:18:57.492 --> 00:18:59.722
Don't come! I apologize.!

00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:02.529
Yoshikawa! Go to heaven!

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:06.958
I got those faces!

00:19:10.905 --> 00:19:14.136
Look! Yoshikawa!
Their faces are terrified!

00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:16.739
See, they're seriously scared!

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:25.245
Great performance!
You looked like a real zombie.

00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:27.321
Even though they act like bullies,
they're still girls!

00:19:28.923 --> 00:19:30.982
What's going on?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.758
Oh, that was fun!
Then I'm going back...

00:19:35.063 --> 00:19:36.087
What?!

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:42.901
Then get along well
as roommates. See ya!

00:19:43.905 --> 00:19:47.170
What happened?!

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:50.504
Yoshikawa! You.!

00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:53.979
Sorry! Again,
I was tempted by a devil!

00:19:58.386 --> 00:20:01.321
Everyone, please listen to me
while you're eating breakfast.

00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:03.017
Today, after your free time...

00:20:03.124 --> 00:20:05.058
...in the morning, we're going...

00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:06.854
...to see a colony
of Yaeyama Palm Trees.

00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:09.994
The meeting time is
1 :00 in the parking lot.

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:12.958
What happened
to your face, Yoshikawa?

00:20:13.735 --> 00:20:16.363
You look like Joe's face
after the boxing match.

00:20:16.638 --> 00:20:18.663
Well, I was roughed up
just a little bit by Uehara-san...

00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:24.211
If you do it again, I'll kill you.

00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:29.176
What are you smiling at,
Yoshikawa?!

00:20:29.684 --> 00:20:31.345
No, nothing...

00:20:31.452 --> 00:20:32.441
See?! Again!

00:20:32.987 --> 00:20:36.354
Hey! Be quiet during breakfast!

00:20:37.358 --> 00:20:40.657
So how was yesterday?
Did you guys get along after that?

00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:43.562
You see my face, don't you?
I was hit a lot.

00:20:44.198 --> 00:20:47.725
But you had fun, didn't you?
Your face is saying so.

00:20:47.869 --> 00:20:48.836
Kind of...

00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:52.802
But they're girls after all. It's funny.

00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:55.968
They couldn't sleep at all after that.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.235
They were playing cards all night.

00:20:59.213 --> 00:21:00.612
It was a great success!

00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:06.512
Yoshikawa.
You somehow look like a man now.

00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:07.848
What?

00:21:08.222 --> 00:21:10.156
It's like you became a real man...

00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:14.387
Let's see...
Let's confirm it with the evidence.!

00:21:14.562 --> 00:21:15.551
What are you doing?!

00:21:16.497 --> 00:21:17.987
Stop it!

00:21:18.099 --> 00:21:21.159
Anko, are you leaving them alone?

00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:25.436
So what happened last night?
Tell me! Please!

00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:28.638
Watch me, Onizuka.

00:21:29.577 --> 00:21:31.977
I'll never forgive him.!

What are you doing?!

00:23:31.874 --> 00:23:36.038
Onizuka-sensei! A box has appeared!

00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:37.610
What?!

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:46.216
I... I... So it isn't me!
