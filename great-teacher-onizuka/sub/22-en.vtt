WEBVTT

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:11.967
Love song sung
For a million people

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:16.590
I don't just feel it

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:23.967
This street makes me love

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.736
Easy love! Easy come! Easy go!

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.875
The future looks more realistic
Than we ever imagined

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:38.248
Cars don't look they will float
In the air anytime soon

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:43.525
And today, I get on the subway
Like always

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:48.365
Silent strangers leave me behind
On the street...so then

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:55.167
Lonely, lonely,
even in the painful and frail night

00:00:55.573 --> 00:01:00.374
Lonely, lonely, keep on
Giving me your original love

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:06.309
Lonely, lonely, longing for you,
My life is so cold

00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:11.477
I decided I won't do
What I can't put into words

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.357
Only she can caress my heart,
I want to forget

00:01:19.597 --> 00:01:22.930
Love me, love me
With strong and fragile heart

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:26.730
Kiss me, kiss me,
I worry in the lonely night

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:41.192
Scene 56, take 2!

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:42.430
DANGEROUS
DYNAMITE DETECTIVE

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:43.802
Start!

00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:52.454
Cut!

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:53.789
Idiot!

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:56.287
Too late! You'd be dead by now.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.725
The dynamite's fuse has
already reached the bottom.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:01.127
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:02.724
Let me try one more time.

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:04.131
Of course!

00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:07.941
Okay. Until we're ready,
take a break.

00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:12.898
It must have been
shocking for Hitomi.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.128
Not only Hitomi...

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:19.472
...all the kids loved Sagara-sensei.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:25.336
The parents made a big deal of it
and everyone was talking about it.

00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:29.116
That was this spring...

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.510
...since then,
Hitomi has been like that.

00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:36.389
She can't get
used to her school, either.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:37.888
Is that so?

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:39.751
Done.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:42.226
Azusa, could you take it there?

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.993
What? Oh, sure.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.266
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to say to Hitomi.

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:53.139
Maybe it's because my wife died
when Hitomi was little.

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:57.711
She probably thought
of Sagara-sensei as her own mother.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.911
Her own mother...

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:03.107
Teacher-student relationships
are difficult.

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:08.321
Good. It's too good!

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.755
These days, I've been poor.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:13.953
I've been eating instant noodles
for breakfast.

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.489
I made more than enough.
Eat as much as you want.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.600
I have to go shopping in town
today. I have to leave now.

00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:23.865
Thank you.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.340
Really? Then I'll eat my fill,
since you offered.

00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:31.508
Hey. If you don't want
the bacon and eggs, I'll take them!

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.707
No way!
I save my favorites for last.

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.778
What are you going to do
if there is an earthquake?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.811
You should eat your favorites first.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.279
Stop it!

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.922
Give it to me, Murai-chan.

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.630
Don't call me "chan"
It makes me sick.

00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:52.166
- Please give it to me.
- Absolutely not!

00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:55.369
Is that so?
Then I have no choice.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.306
Thank you very much
for everything.

00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:06.107
I'm indebted to you.

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:08.474
That teacher is a good teacher.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:11.078
You mean Onizuka?

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.686
He's good, because he puts himself
on the same level as the kids.

00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:19.960
It might have been better for Hitomi
if she had a teacher like him.

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:24.297
I'm a country guy and don't know
about schools in Tokyo.

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:29.595
The only thing I know for sure is
that all jobs have their drawbacks.

00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:30.760
Owner...

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:33.797
If you come this far
whenever you're in trouble...

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.775
...transportation
will become expensive.

00:04:36.244 --> 00:04:38.303
Onizuka said the same thing.

00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:40.940
Is that right? Oh, boy...

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:45.314
I preach too much when I have
problems with my daughter.

00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:46.621
See you.

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:48.656
Thank you very much.

00:04:56.331 --> 00:04:57.423
Gross.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.497
Sensei, if I don't go back
to Tokyo now...

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.366
... my manager will be upset
with me.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:07.100
That's right.
I forgot about the lesson.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.412
But we came this far.
Why don't we go sightseeing?

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.408
That's not our reason
for being here.

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:17.343
You ate my bacon and eggs.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.847
Let's leave him alone
and go back home.

00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:24.320
I'm so sorry, everyone.

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.257
I'm all right now.

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.887
Onizuka, could you take them
back to Tokyo?

00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:33.300
What are you going to do?

00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:35.395
I have something in mind...

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:39.136
Okay, see you at school tomorrow.

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:53.816
Are you saying
a teacher can't be in love?

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:56.783
Are you going to justify
what you did?

00:05:57.158 --> 00:05:59.490
What are you going to tell the kids?

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:02.488
I have no intention
of making any excuses.

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:05.155
I'll just tell them the facts
as they are.

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:11.562
Nice breeze.

00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.669
You're still here.

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.113
Yes.

00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:20.912
May I sit here?

00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:24.917
Why did you come here?

00:06:25.086 --> 00:06:26.917
I've had enough preaching.

00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:30.147
I did not come for that.
Before going back to Tokyo...

00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:32.216
... I wanted to speak with you
one more time.

00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.659
You did come here to preach.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:35.796
No.

00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:37.555
I'm just...

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:39.292
Yes, you did.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:43.329
No matter what you say,
Sagara-sensei will never come back.

00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:49.474
Do you want her to be back?

00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:54.539
Yes, I do.

00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:57.477
She abandoned us
and left with a guy.

00:06:57.552 --> 00:06:59.543
I want her to apologize to us for that.

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:03.421
But you haven't heard
her side of the story.

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:04.883
Her side of the story?

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.984
What kind of story can she have
for committing adultery?

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:08.585
There's no story for that!

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:11.732
Hitomi...

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:12.922
I, a teacher...

00:07:13.468 --> 00:07:14.662
... no, just me...

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:18.637
My female students
threw water on me.

00:07:18.807 --> 00:07:19.774
What?

00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:21.870
They said to me...

00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:24.877
"You always come across
as a woman.

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:27.312
Don't try to act like our teacher."

00:07:28.383 --> 00:07:30.977
I had no intention of doing that.

00:07:33.388 --> 00:07:35.322
Your father said...

00:07:35.657 --> 00:07:38.820
"Teacher-student relationships
are difficult."

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:43.059
Still, both Sagara-senpai
and I are teachers.

00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:45.161
I can't change that.

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:47.058
That's obvious!

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:50.636
I just can't forgive her
for abandoning everyone.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:54.539
She didn't commit adultery
so she could abandon all of you.

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:55.867
That's too much!

00:07:55.944 --> 00:07:58.412
The result was the same
as if she'd abandoned us.

00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:01.177
But I want you to understand this.

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:05.883
She really cared about all of you.

00:08:06.788 --> 00:08:08.415
No mistake about that.

00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:11.117
That's why I wanted
to become a teacher.

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:14.559
After watching the strong bond
between you and her.

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.160
She just made one little mistake.

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:20.397
Don't you remember
how fun it was?

00:08:20.602 --> 00:08:23.696
She, you, and all of them
were shining.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:29.235
To hate her means
to hate all those memories.

00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:31.508
Are you okay with that?

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:33.746
Hitomi!

00:08:39.454 --> 00:08:40.648
Azusa-san.

00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:41.950
I'm sorry.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.118
I tried to think that way
many times.

00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:47.452
But I...

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:50.087
I can't forgive Sagara-sensei.

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:51.153
Hitomi...

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:57.133
That school
will be demolished soon.

00:08:58.439 --> 00:08:59.428
That's good.

00:08:59.607 --> 00:09:00.767
It's better...

00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:01.876
CEMENT

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.238
...to clear everything.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.509
That may be!

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.616
It's much easier.

00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.575
Onizuka...

00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:14.713
Wow, Onizuka-sensei looks sharp!

00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:18.388
I would say he is the most
self-centered person in Japan.

00:09:18.526 --> 00:09:20.084
Just a plain idiot.

00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:21.489
Maybe the worst idiot.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.893
Who cares
if a teacher committed adultery?

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:27.866
What, Onizuka?

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:31.468
Even if I wanted to commit adultery,
I don't have a wife.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.868
I don't even have a girlfriend.

00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:39.306
I've got 50 yen left in my pocket
the day before payday.

00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:44.179
Even today, I have to borrow money
from Murai to go back to Tokyo.

00:09:44.686 --> 00:09:46.244
What? What is he saying?

00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:48.551
Don't kid me. Why me?

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.448
50 yen?

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:52.124
Yeah! And...

00:09:52.894 --> 00:09:53.883
Oops.

00:09:54.729 --> 00:09:56.390
What was I talking about?

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.393
Oh, that's right.
It's about adultery. Adultery.

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:02.102
Listen.

00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:04.837
The most important thing
to remember is...

00:10:04.973 --> 00:10:08.340
...even if a teacher commits adultery,
or the school is demolished...

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.206
...or Mt. Fuji erupts...

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:14.146
...memories do not disappear
because of such small things.

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:17.850
I don't think that Mt. Fuji erupting
would be considered a small thing.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.417
He's a real idiot!

00:10:20.722 --> 00:10:22.883
The real important thing...?

00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:27.694
That's right. They'll never disappear.
Not like my paycheck.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.694
Sure, adultery
may not be a good thing.

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:34.335
But teachers are human, too.

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:37.962
They may make mistakes
when they're in love.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.674
Sagara-sensei chose
her own way by herself...

00:10:43.044 --> 00:10:45.706
...even though that might be
a mistake.

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:49.072
That's all.

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:54.253
It's not like she did it
in order to destroy your memories.

00:10:54.622 --> 00:10:57.557
You should give
more thought to that point.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:00.122
Own way...?

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:05.225
In order to move forward,
we have to find our own path.

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.096
What's happening?

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.601
Is this an old boat?

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.297
Onizuka!

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:14.837
When did you guys
get off the boat?

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:18.109
Teacher,
you looked sharp, but now...

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:19.810
Help!

00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:24.415
Because you ignore who you are,
and preach like an authority...

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:26.180
...you're being punished.

00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:27.945
Leave him alone.

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:30.752
I definitely will not lend
him any money.

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.553
Teacher, you look dorky.

00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:34.458
Fuyutsuki-chan, help me!

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:40.893
Don't laugh. Do something!

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:42.700
I'm sorry. Kikuchi!

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:49.602
You're cruel. Don't laugh.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.342
It's strange.

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:56.577
While I was watching Onizuka-sensei,
I realized it doesn't matter anymore.

00:11:57.351 --> 00:12:00.115
It's true. Fun memories will...

00:12:00.188 --> 00:12:02.952
...never disappear,
no matter what happens.

00:12:03.558 --> 00:12:04.547
Hitomi...

00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:06.382
Azusa-san...

00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.722
No, Fuyutsuki Sensei.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.427
Onizuka Sensei.

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:12.232
Thank you.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:16.327
So that means I'm great?

00:12:16.604 --> 00:12:18.970
- Idiot!
- That's too much.

00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:21.035
Stop. Stop it!

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:24.669
What's that?

00:12:28.483 --> 00:12:30.713
The demolition is going to start.

00:12:31.853 --> 00:12:33.514
The organ... The organ!

00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:35.719
The organ!

00:13:05.196 --> 00:13:06.720
What's going on?

00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:07.764
She's fast.

00:13:07.858 --> 00:13:09.120
Where did she go?

00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:11.823
Didn't you make her understand?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.995
That's her impulsiveness.

00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:17.199
When she heard the siren...

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:18.928
...she wanted to at least save
the organ.

00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:20.365
What?

00:13:20.637 --> 00:13:22.867
No time to discuss it.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.604
Wait for me!

00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:43.510
Ready!

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:44.978
IN OPERATION

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:45.979
It's on.

00:13:46.747 --> 00:13:48.408
Five more minutes to detonation!

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:49.616
Start!

00:13:56.523 --> 00:14:00.186
But why do they need
to use a timer? It's dangerous.

00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:03.255
According to the director,
that's the point.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.297
What?

00:14:04.665 --> 00:14:08.567
If they fail, they may die.
That's when this becomes real.

00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:10.125
Real?

00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:12.266
For Happa Deka Doshin?

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:15.906
He just wanted to do it once?

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.402
Stop it!

00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:20.874
Stop the detonation right now!

00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:22.915
Who-who are you?

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:26.814
Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old.
Nice to meet you.

00:14:28.522 --> 00:14:30.490
We think a kid went inside.

00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:32.354
Please stop it right now!

00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:33.757
No way.

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:43.027
Director! It's true.

00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:45.802
All right. Let's stop right now.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.268
Abort. Abort.
Abort filming the demolition!

00:14:49.343 --> 00:14:50.970
Abort the demolition!

00:14:55.282 --> 00:14:56.544
I can't abort it.

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.958
Bad news!
We can't abort the command.

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:09.962
What?! Idiot!

00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:12.388
What is she thinking?

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:15.764
She went in
to get something important.

00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:19.071
Doesn't it stop
if you unplug these cords?

00:15:19.306 --> 00:15:21.467
It doesn't work that way.
Even if you unplug them...

00:15:21.542 --> 00:15:24.978
...each explosive has its own timer
which continues the countdown.

00:15:25.045 --> 00:15:26.205
What?

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.974
Who made
such impractical equipment?

00:15:29.183 --> 00:15:33.085
What are you going to do? We've
already wasted more than a minute.

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:34.921
I'm going in.

00:15:35.322 --> 00:15:37.313
I'm bringing Hitomi back!

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:41.319
What are you doing?
Don't be a fool!

00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:47.400
Onizuka...

00:15:57.844 --> 00:15:58.936
Idiot!

00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:00.973
Where is the organ?

00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.374
Upstairs in the room at the end.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.908
Go back!

00:16:05.118 --> 00:16:06.107
Onizuka.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.845
I'm gonna grab her
and bring her back.

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:27.400
This has to be...

00:16:27.774 --> 00:16:28.866
This...

00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:40.146
Shit! There are two ends!

00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:47.126
Hey, we're in serious trouble.

00:16:47.794 --> 00:16:51.890
If it blows,
teacher and Hitomi will be...

00:16:52.032 --> 00:16:53.124
It's obvious.

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:55.626
They'll be blown to pieces,
won't they?

00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:58.199
Hey, don't say that aloud!

00:16:58.872 --> 00:16:59.861
Sorry.

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:03.835
If not blown to pieces,
then vaporized.

00:17:03.977 --> 00:17:05.001
It's obvious.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:06.978
Don't say that aloud!

00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:09.641
No, we can't stop it.

00:17:10.784 --> 00:17:12.081
Excuse me.

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:13.681
Hitomi!

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:18.884
We can't abort the detonation!
It's gonna explode in a second.

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:20.583
Escape now!

00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:23.559
Onizuka-sensei is on his way there.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.255
Come out with him!

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.098
Crap! The other end!

00:17:41.014 --> 00:17:42.174
It's gonna explode!

00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.216
No!

00:17:43.817 --> 00:17:47.810
The real memories will
never disappear! I said so earlier.

00:17:47.954 --> 00:17:52.721
But even if the school is gone,
I really want to save this.

00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:55.456
Please! Please help me!

00:17:55.562 --> 00:17:56.529
Shit!

00:17:56.897 --> 00:17:57.886
No choice.

00:17:58.632 --> 00:17:59.656
Ready?

00:18:01.902 --> 00:18:03.096
Are you okay?

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:09.840
They're late.
What are they doing?

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:14.039
I hope they're not seriously thinking
of taking out the organ.

00:18:14.314 --> 00:18:17.647
No way! There's no way
they can come out in time.

00:18:17.718 --> 00:18:19.743
That fool may do it, though.

00:18:20.687 --> 00:18:23.815
Police! No, call an ambulance!

00:18:25.192 --> 00:18:28.559
Teacher-student relationships
are difficult.

00:18:29.262 --> 00:18:31.856
That teacher is a good teacher.

00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:35.327
You mean Onizuka?

00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:38.199
He's good, because he puts himself
at the same level as the kids.

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.438
Oh, shit. This weighs a ton!

00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:44.507
Teacher, what shall we do?

00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:46.007
Calm down.

00:18:46.246 --> 00:18:49.215
I trust Onizuka-sensei.

00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:50.775
Sensei!

00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:52.646
Quick! Go quickly!

00:18:52.753 --> 00:18:57.281
I'm sorry. I thought they would hold
the demolition if I came in here.

00:18:57.357 --> 00:18:58.756
I didn't expect this.

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:01.521
If you have time to speak,
run, idiot!

00:19:01.728 --> 00:19:02.717
But...

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:13.806
Onizuka!

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:15.304
Hitomi!

00:19:17.844 --> 00:19:18.811
This way!

00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:41.456
Hitomi...

00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:43.703
Onizuka...

00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:56.843
Onizuka!

00:19:57.417 --> 00:19:58.406
Onizuka!

00:20:01.087 --> 00:20:02.884
Teacher, are you okay?

00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:06.024
How could I die
before having a girlfriend?

00:20:09.162 --> 00:20:11.494
- Great! How could you survive?
- Hitomi!

00:20:14.334 --> 00:20:15.892
- Here you are.
- What?

00:20:16.303 --> 00:20:17.998
A key from the organ.

00:20:18.972 --> 00:20:22.840
Isn't it enough to have something
like this for your memories?

00:20:24.277 --> 00:20:25.244
Yes.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.610
The past is the past.
You should move on.

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:36.851
Thank you, Onizuka-sensei.

00:20:41.428 --> 00:20:45.091
Onizuka, thank you. I...

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:48.325
How would you like to be alone
in space?

00:20:48.568 --> 00:20:50.729
Don't you feel refreshed?

00:20:51.171 --> 00:20:55.301
I feel I can do it again.

00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:03.073
Relax and keep going.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.746
Just go straight ahead.
Don't worry too much.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.158
If fish swarm at you, let them eat
as much as they want.

00:21:14.528 --> 00:21:15.927
Until they get full.

00:21:17.364 --> 00:21:19.161
That's also our duty...

00:21:20.267 --> 00:21:21.632
...as teachers.

00:21:26.172 --> 00:21:28.333
Should we go back to our school?

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:53.081
You can't love everyone

00:21:53.253 --> 00:21:56.313
It's only for the one you love

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.492
No breaking your faith or doubting

00:22:00.661 --> 00:22:05.894
Don't you judge or hate?

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:10.462
Just stay innocent

00:22:10.737 --> 00:22:14.673
Am I hurting anyone?

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:22.748
My emotion quietly blazes
Deep inside my eyes

00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:27.611
I am so happy that I found you

00:22:29.356 --> 00:22:32.883
In the infinity of eternal time

00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:37.119
What is there for me to do?

00:22:37.364 --> 00:22:41.164
It may be small now

00:22:41.368 --> 00:22:45.327
But the fire cannot go out

00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:49.167
A tear is about to drop

00:22:49.509 --> 00:22:53.445
Hold it back in your chest

00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:57.309
Live strong every moment

00:22:57.517 --> 00:23:03.456
Like a single drop of your tear

00:23:17.204 --> 00:23:18.398
What's this?

00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:20.698
A chain letter?

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:21.934
NEXT EPISODE

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:23.271
Ouch, ouch!

00:23:24.211 --> 00:23:28.307
The curse from the chain letter says
you'll die on the seventh day.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.665
As they said,
I've been seriously cursed.
