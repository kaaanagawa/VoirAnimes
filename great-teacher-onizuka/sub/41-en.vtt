Get up! Everyone, get up!

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:45.016
It's the middle of the night!

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:46.483
What's going on?

00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:47.551
Leave me alone!

00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:49.224
Idiots!

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:51.807
You're students!

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:53.812
Can't you stay up late?!

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.865
Everyone! Change into
your swimsuits right now!

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:58.931
What? Swimsuits...?

00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:01.238
Swimsuits?!

00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:03.872
Don't be dopey, Onizuka!

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:05.443
Shut up!

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.214
Swimsuit! Swimsuit! Swimsuit!

00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:15.709
The last night in Okinawa...

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:16.874
...is a special event...

00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:18.880
Let's begin!

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.683
What...What is it?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.918
Excuse me, Onizuka-sensei.
What is this?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.504
Oh, this?

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.381
It's a hotel, which was built
as a big resort development...

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.646
...but the plans
became deadlocked...

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:36.752
...and it went bankrupt.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.387
You didn't say
anything about that.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.895
A swimsuit party
at this time of night...?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.020
What are you going to do?

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.596
It's summer! Of course
you know what that means!

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.466
Kimodameshi.
(A test of everyone's nerve.)

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.970
Kimodameshi.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.407
Kimodameshi...?

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.875
Oh, that's stupid!
Kimodameshi is for kids!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:02.642
Are you sure?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.114
Why do we need to wear
swimsuits for Kimodameshi?

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.083
That's right!
What are you thinking of?!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.380
Calm down.
You don't need to get excited.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.889
You will see...

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.393
Oh, I forgot to mention...

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:20.600
...because of the bankruptcy,
the owner of this hotel...

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.167
...committed suicide in a fire...

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.404
See. There's still a black
burn mark on the wall...

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.104
Don't scare us...

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.973
I was just surprised...

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.612
What is Onizuka thinking?
Kimodameshi...?

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.716
Now do you understand?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.657
If someone clings to you...

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:51.253
...wouldn't you rather be
touching their bare skin?

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.491
You mean...

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.324
That's right..!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.869
The rules are simple.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.666
You just need to write
down your name...

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.741
...in the notebook
on the basement floor.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.540
But in pairs of boys and girls.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:06.805
Pairs of boys and girls?!

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:11.382
Uehara... I thought
you'd be excited.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.746
After all, this is your chance...

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:13.944
...to be with a man
alone in the dark...

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.690
I see...
That's what he's thinking...

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:23.326
Onizuka's trying
to pair me with Yoshikawa...

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.726
I'm going to announce the pairs.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.664
First, Yoshikawa and Uehara.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.298
Kikuchi and lijima.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:33.272
Makimura and Tanaka.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.431
Kato and Yamada.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.737
Ichikawa and Sasho.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:38.866
As I thought..!

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:40.445
- Uehara-san.
- Akiyama and Asakura.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.514
- We're together again.
- Amimoto and Izumi.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.708
- I guess so.
- Takahashi and Sakai

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:45.785
Yoroshiku!
(We'll watch out for each other!)

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.284
- Yeah...
- Hirano and Kakimoto.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.946
And Kanzaki and Shirai,
Tokita &amp; Mishima.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.785
Wait a minute! Why am I
the only one in a group of four?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.458
Couldn't help it.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.096
They all insisted
on being on your team.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.596
Kanzaki-san's hair color
is exactly the same as Sayla's.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.465
She's also aloof like Sayla.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.200
Hey, Onizuka!

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.600
We don't have partners.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.268
With whom should we pair up?

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.073
Oh, you guys are
with Fuyutsuki-sensei.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.148
What?!

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.615
Am I here
to even out the numbers?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.009
No.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.318
You, together with
Murai and the others...

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.322
...are responsible
for scaring them.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.057
Scaring them?!

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.730
Hey, don't walk too far from me!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.238
What are you laughing at?

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:44.040
I just remembered
that you scare quite easily.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.304
What do you mean?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.039
Aren't you scared?

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:49.647
I don't have a sixth sense.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.573
That's beside the point.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.614
What?! What?! What?! What?!

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.388
Something is coming!

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.190
Don't worry!

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.233
That's Onizuka-sensei!

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.062
It's headless! How could you
know that's Onizuka?!

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.734
Because the upper body
is abnormally long...

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.401
...and he is the only one
who wears clothes like that.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.278
I see...

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.050
Why are you
knocking me down?!

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.019
You held on to me
and then knocked me down!

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.623
Why would I have
to hold on to you?!

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.503
Really, she is not
honest with her feelings...

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.536
Kushaan, Kushaan...

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.738
"At a time like this, it is
better to be a coward, isn't it?"

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.712
Like people say, I wonder
if ghosts really have legs?

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.449
"The legs are
just for decoration."

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.817
"High-ranking officers
don't know that."

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.855
"You're sharp, kid!"

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.949
I don't understand...

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.389
I don't understand what
they are talking about at all...

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.655
"Don't worry."

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.598
"You, Sayla, can do it.
I'm sure of it."

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.294
Who is Sayla?!

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:18.971
There!

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.538
I suppose they want us
to watch the video...

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.296
This...this is..!

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:58.474
SADA

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.648
Sa...da...

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.153
Why are you running away?!

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:16.684
It's Sadako!

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:17.820
Why is she coming out?!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.590
It's nonsense!

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.793
Ghosts are an illusion
caused by human fear!

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:24.267
That's just a theory.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.568
Success!

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.775
I didn't think they
would get that scared!

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.535
This may become my hobby!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.047
Was that a scream?!

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:44.924
I don't know.

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:47.922
Wait. Don't leave me!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:57.764
Are you not talking
to me because of Aizawa?

00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.696
That is a different matter.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.107
Yeah...?

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.567
Come to think of it...

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.440
...we did Kimodameshi
last year, too, didn't we?

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.707
Yeah. We had
surume (dried squid)...

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.510
...at the vacant house
in Inogashira park.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.377
We had to eat it and come back.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.777
The apartment was so spooky...

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.410
...that the ghost really
seemed to appear...

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.250
We finally found the surume...

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:19.425
...and just at the moment
we were about to eat...

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.490
That was not funny...

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:26.290
That may be
the first and last time...

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.560
...you'll be seen
seriously upset...

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.464
It was fun at that time...

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.665
Everyone was so close...

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:38.236
lijima, you can
come back anytime.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.372
If you want to...

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:44.147
Why don't you quit being
stubborn and enjoy it with us...

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.773
...like you used to?

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:48.047
I can't.

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.520
Because if I did...

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:54.583
...Miyabi will be alone...

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.697
For Miyabi,
that incident isn't over yet.

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.466
So I also...

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:01.533
Here it is.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.934
Here. Why don't you
write yours, too?

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.479
Don't worry. She'll be back.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.589
What?

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.418
At the Kimodameshi last year...

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.049
...do you remember who was
laughing and crying the hardest?

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.827
Who was the most honest
with their feelings?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.601
So let's have fun
and wait for her.

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:42.904
Then someday Onizuka
will bring Aizawa back to us...

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.401
Yeah...

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.711
ROUTE

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:59.690
- Hey, let's go to the second part!
- Okay!

00:11:06.798 --> 00:11:08.459
ROUTE

00:11:16.973 --> 00:11:18.463
It's getting cold.

00:11:19.008 --> 00:11:19.975
Are you all right?

00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:23.009
First of all, why are you
the only one wearing a T-shirt?

00:11:23.713 --> 00:11:25.613
Onizuka told us
to wear a swimsuit.

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:28.573
You're so gullible.

00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:32.048
What do you mean?!
I don't understand at all!

00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:33.815
That's all right.
I'll let you have this.

00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:35.117
Of course you should.

00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:39.584
Now, are you sure
this is the right way?

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:41.760
It seems like the plants
are becoming gigantic.

00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:44.391
The sign indicated
this was the route...

00:11:44.534 --> 00:11:46.934
...and this is
a sugar cane field, isn't it?

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:54.367
What's that? A wolf?!

00:11:54.977 --> 00:11:56.740
Japanese wolves are extinct.

00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:59.570
First of all, there are
no wolves in Okinawa.

00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:05.910
Here it is!

00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.487
Did you see that?!

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.784
Don't worry about that.

00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:12.118
Wait! It's dangerous.

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:13.593
It's all right. It's all right.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.127
DOGMAN

00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:16.391
DEMON DOG

00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:17.761
Fujiyoshi!

00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:20.199
Instead of a human-faced dog,
he looks like an eel-dog!

00:12:20.403 --> 00:12:23.270
Don't be rude. You should
act like you're scared!

00:12:23.673 --> 00:12:25.834
OBJECT X

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:27.000
Murai..!

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.344
OKIKU DOLL

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:31.507
That's Kusano!

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:35.306
What's this? It's not scary at all!

00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:37.181
I told you it wasn't scary.

00:12:40.857 --> 00:12:41.824
I remember when I was
in elementary school...

00:12:41.924 --> 00:12:43.516
- When did I...?!
-...we went to explore...

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:44.648
...the graveyard...

00:12:45.094 --> 00:12:46.061
- It's been...
-...and the priest found us...

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:47.253
-...since kindergarten...
-...and chased us.

00:12:47.396 --> 00:12:48.886
-...that I've held hands...
- The priest who chased us...

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:49.965
...like this...

00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:52.359
- Now I remember...
-...looked exactly like Fujiyoshi.

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:55.897
...a high school boy
confessed his feelings...

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:58.269
...about me one time
and we went to a movie.

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:00.342
At that time...

00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:02.707
...I felt like an invisible
man was sitting between us...

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:06.945
The time inside the theater
seemed to stretch.

00:13:10.052 --> 00:13:12.486
I wonder if I've been afraid...

00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:15.351
...to get close
to people like this...

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:18.387
...to have other people
know my feelings...

00:13:18.995 --> 00:13:21.156
Maybe that's why I've kept
my distance from people...

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:25.022
I wonder...

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:27.830
Time goes by so fast
when I'm with him.

00:13:33.943 --> 00:13:35.069
Are you all right?!

00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:36.901
Now I've done it...

00:13:38.814 --> 00:13:40.406
This was expensive...

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:44.475
If you don't mind,
you can wear these.

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:45.854
What?!

00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:48.783
- That's all right.
- I'm all right.

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:50.187
I can walk back barefoot.

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:52.251
But...

00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:53.623
Let me see your feet.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.329
But..!

00:13:55.698 --> 00:13:58.531
Never mind! Now stand up!

00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:01.032
What?! But... But...

00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:07.335
Wow! Your feet
are big for your size.

00:14:09.078 --> 00:14:10.045
Size 25?

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:11.541
I'm a 26 and a half.

00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.538
You're kidding! I can't believe it!

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:15.841
You grew up so fast...

00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:17.781
...once you started high school.

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:20.552
Who knows? You may
end up being 180cm tall!

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:21.745
I'm glad...

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.092
About what?

00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:28.628
Because you've
been quiet for a while...

00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:35.299
...I thought you were bored
being with a guy like me...

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.240
He's too...

00:14:42.745 --> 00:14:47.045
He's just like me...
He's afraid to get hurt, too...

00:14:50.186 --> 00:14:52.677
Hey, it's the love birds!

00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:54.419
Very hot!

00:14:54.624 --> 00:14:57.149
They're a hot couple!

00:14:57.526 --> 00:15:00.290
Looks like you're having fun.
Can we join you?

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:05.425
What are you going to do?!

00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:09.831
Such a terrible thing
coming from such a cute face.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:12.430
Leave that geek
and have fun with us!

00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:14.039
No! Leave me alone!

00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.210
Leave her alone!

00:15:17.813 --> 00:15:18.871
Yoshikawa!

00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.546
Leave her alone?

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.975
Are you going to fight us?

00:15:36.532 --> 00:15:37.794
Yoshikawa!

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.192
Yoshikawa!

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.003
Knocked out with one punch.

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:45.903
Just as I thought,
he's got no guts!

00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:47.899
Boss! What should
we do with him?

00:15:48.144 --> 00:15:50.476
Leave that cherry!

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:52.810
Let's go now, cutie pie!

00:15:52.948 --> 00:15:55.576
Dance with us all night!

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:57.044
Yo...Yoshikawa...

00:15:58.487 --> 00:16:01.684
A cute woman like you
deserves better...

00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.857
There are a lot better
guys than this nerd.

00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:12.124
Weren't you embarrassed
to be seen with this geek?

00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:21.109
Let's go.

00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:24.303
Let's leave this boring cherry.

00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:30.508
What are you doing?!

00:16:30.786 --> 00:16:32.447
Shut up, you old fart!

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:35.189
What's with this
hysterical woman?

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:36.417
Apologize to Yoshikawa!

00:16:43.532 --> 00:16:45.762
Blood! Blood!!!

00:16:47.002 --> 00:16:47.969
Leader!

00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:50.764
Do you really
like that wimpy guy?

00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:53.641
You're right, Yoshikawa is short!

00:16:54.343 --> 00:16:56.436
He isn't handsome,
and he's a nerd!

00:16:56.812 --> 00:17:00.441
He's not athletic, and his grades
are much lower than mine!

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.883
Even the girls pick on him!

00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:05.647
So what?!

00:17:06.722 --> 00:17:09.350
You say that...

00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:11.050
...but do you still like him?!

00:17:11.627 --> 00:17:14.425
Are you saying you love
that shorty that much?

00:17:14.597 --> 00:17:16.155
That's right! Do you
have a problem with that?!

00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:18.433
I love him!

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:20.026
Yoshikawa...

00:17:20.402 --> 00:17:22.734
I can't help loving him..!

00:17:27.877 --> 00:17:28.844
So what?!

00:17:29.044 --> 00:17:30.204
Something wrong with that?

00:17:36.852 --> 00:17:38.217
So it's true!

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.810
This is a great scoop!

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:43.152
Who would've ever imagined
Uehara falling for Yoshikawa?!

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.920
See? It's exactly like I said.

00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:51.029
You're...?!

00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:04.041
Wasn't it Uehara who
picked on Yoshikawa?

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.711
It seems like
the more she loves him...

00:18:05.815 --> 00:18:07.214
...the more she wants
to pick on him...

00:18:07.349 --> 00:18:08.338
I see...

00:18:08.918 --> 00:18:09.976
Don't try to figure it out.

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:12.383
First of all,
why are you guys here?!

00:18:13.989 --> 00:18:15.149
Never mind that.

00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.952
It was good because you were
able to admit your true feelings.

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.284
Right, Uehara?

00:18:19.728 --> 00:18:23.687
By the way,
we recorded what you said.

00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:27.129
You're kidding!

00:18:27.403 --> 00:18:30.895
Now everyone's
gonna laugh at me!

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.507
Don't worry about that.

00:18:33.008 --> 00:18:34.999
Rumors end within 75 days.

00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.805
That's not the point!

00:18:39.415 --> 00:18:41.906
Are you still embarrassed?

00:18:42.484 --> 00:18:43.451
What?

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.245
...but do you still like him?!

00:18:46.455 --> 00:18:49.322
Are you saying you love
that shorty that much?

00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:52.591
That's right! Do you
have a problem with that?!

00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:54.653
I love him!

00:18:55.197 --> 00:18:56.562
Yoshikawa...

00:18:56.765 --> 00:18:58.858
I can't help loving him..!

00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:01.869
Was this a lie?

00:19:03.973 --> 00:19:07.739
Other people laugh at you?
Short? Weak?

00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:10.872
That's nothing...

00:19:11.413 --> 00:19:12.903
...if you really love him...

00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:16.510
Listen, Uehara.

00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:22.014
Real love will make you blind.

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.193
Like yourself a little while ago.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.024
At that time
you were extremely cute.

00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:39.935
Here we go.
It's a memory for you...

00:19:40.042 --> 00:19:41.839
...to remember to be
honest with your feelings.

00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:47.672
Don't be so embarrassed.

00:19:48.183 --> 00:19:49.309
I'm not...

00:19:49.952 --> 00:19:51.442
It's nice to be young...

00:19:57.626 --> 00:19:59.992
You hit me, you punk!

00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:03.587
Yoshikawa! Stop it!
It's not a punk, it's teacher!

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.167
He punched me in the stomach!

00:20:06.802 --> 00:20:11.398
Hey, you! Just because I didn't
fight back, you crossed the line!

00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:15.043
SADA

00:20:15.144 --> 00:20:16.372
Sa...da...

00:20:20.082 --> 00:20:22.516
Hey! Stop playing and help me!

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:25.213
What are you doing?!

00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:27.012
It's not done yet!

00:20:27.122 --> 00:20:29.113
Wow! I had one
that was backwards!

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:31.993
I'm sorry, Sayla...

00:20:32.394 --> 00:20:34.385
I'm telling you, I'm not Sayla!

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:36.623
Hey, Tokita. Pour the soy sauce!

00:20:36.732 --> 00:20:37.994
Mishima, plate, plate!

00:20:40.602 --> 00:20:41.933
Sea turtle!

00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:44.467
Let's eat this, too!

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.002
Is it okay to eat a sea turtle?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.237
Idiot. Of course it's okay.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.542
I don't think so...

00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:58.047
Wow! Ouch!

00:20:58.487 --> 00:21:01.650
My injury's really starting to hurt!

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.382
What?! Are you
threatening me?!

00:21:04.593 --> 00:21:06.652
If you eat a sea turtle...

00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:08.093
-...it will heal...
- What are you doing, Anko?

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.357
- That's not fair!
- I'm collecting star sand.

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:13.467
They sell it at the souvenir store.

00:21:14.036 --> 00:21:15.025
That's all right.

00:21:15.237 --> 00:21:16.727
According to the book...

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:19.171
...unless I collect it
on my own, it won't work...

00:21:19.641 --> 00:21:23.042
What won't work?!
What are you wishing for?

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:24.237
It's a secret.

00:21:24.646 --> 00:21:27.672
What do you mean?
You have someone you love?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.416
I'm telling you, it's a secret.

00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:32.482
Wow! Are you serious?!
